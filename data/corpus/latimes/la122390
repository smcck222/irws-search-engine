COVER STORY: IT'S A WONDERFUL LIST; 
</P>
<P>
CELEBRITIES TELL WHAT FILMS MOVE THEM DURING THE CHRISTMAS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Christmas . . . a time of goodwill and of good movies. Or so it would seem, as 
the airwaves are filled with such holiday favorites as "White Christmas," 
"Holiday Inn," "A Christmas Carol," "Miracle on 34th Street" and the ubiquitous 
"It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
Everyone has a favorite and that includes celebrities. We asked some to name 
their favorite Yuletide film. Tradition won out with "It's a Wonderful Life" 
and "Miracle on 34th Street" holding a definite edge, but there were some 
surprises. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Asner: It used to be "It's a Wonderful Life," but I've reached overkill on 
that. I would say now it's any version of "A Christmas Carol." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Bakula: I look forward to "White Christmas" every year because I think 
the Irving Berlin music is wonderful and I am a fan of Bing Crosby. 
</P>
<P>
John Beard (KNBC-TV news co-anchor): Frank Capra's "It's a Wonderful Life." My 
family watches it together every year and we all cry like babies because it 
makes us realize how important we are to each other. 
</P>
<P>
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason (creator and co-executive producer of "Designing 
Women" and "Evening Shade"): I would like to be different from the others, but 
you can't miss with "It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
Tom Capra (executive producer, "The Today Show"): "It's a Wonderful Life" 
because it's the best Christmas movie of all time and my dad made it. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Carson: "Miracle on 34th Street" -- because everyone else will mention 
"It's a Wonderful Life." 
</P>
<P>
Jackie Collins (author): "The Godfather" and "The Godfather II," because it's 
the only time I can sit down and watch them both. 
</P>
<P>
Paul DeMeo (co-executive producer of "The Flash"): "The Lady in the Lake." It's 
set during Christmas and has one of my favorite lines when (detective) Philip 
Marlow is questioning a tennis player he says, "Your tan is very nice, it's 
very Christmasy." 
</P>
<P>
Jerry Dunphy (KCAL news anchor): "A Christmas Carol," because there is a strong 
moral message that says you better be good because everybody doesn't get a 
second chance to try it again. 
</P>
<P>
Hal Fishman (KTLA news anchor): "Miracle on 34th Street" because it's 
brilliantly directed. It's a movie in which dreams and expectations and hopes 
really come true, which is what Christmas is all about. 
</P>
<P>
Jackee: "Die Hard." When I saw that towering Christmas tree in the lobby of 
that big old building in Century City and all of those people drinking 
champagne I couldn't stop laughing. This is Christmas in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
James Earl Jones: I inherited an addiction to "It's a Wonderful Life" from my 
wife. I love it because it has an intricate, complex plot that holds up year 
after year. 
</P>
<P>
Larry King: "White Christmas," and the reason is with Bing Crosby and Danny 
Kaye, two of my all-time favorite people, plus Irving Berlin music, you can't 
go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Swoosie Kurtz: "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn." It always makes me cry. It is so 
dear and so wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
Piper Laurie: Jean Shepherd's "A Christmas Story." Unlike most Christmas films, 
which tend to be syrupy and overly sentimental, this film is sharp, very funny 
and extremely touching. 
</P>
<P>
Jess Marlow (KNBC news anchor): "Miracle on 34th Street" is my favorite because 
it gave me a reason to believe in Santa Claus, and if you've had the kind of 
luck I've had, you have to believe in Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
George Peppard: "Five Days From Home" (which he stars in and produced). It's 
about a father giving his son a puppy for Christmas and almost getting killed 
doing it. 
</P>
<P>
John Shea: A television film called "The Nativity." It was my first film. I 
played Joseph and I am stepfather to God and that is why it's my favorite. Now 
I know I will go to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
Cybill Shepherd: "It's a Wonderful Life" because it's a about redemption. I cry 
during the first eight minutes and cry at least four more times during the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
Connie Stevens: "A Pocketful of Miracles" has a great view on life shown 
through the humorous eyes of great director Frank Capra. Cheery, hopeful, 
inspirational. 
</P>
<P>
Mick Sweda (lead guitarist of L.A.-based heavy metal band BulletBoys): "Lethal 
Weapon," which I consider a Christmas film since that is the season in which it 
takes place. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Weathers: "Miracle on 34th Street" is for the kid in me. The whole idea of 
dreams coming true and Santa Claus being real. It's a very endearing movie. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Winters: The English version of "A Christmas Carol" because I like the 
message behind it. 
</P>
<P>
Edward Woodward: "Mary Poppins," and the reason is my daughter Emily has 
watched it more than 100 times and because her aunt, Karen Dotrice, plays the 
little girl, Jane. And CBS' "A Christmas Carol" because it features the 
definitive performance of Ebenezer Scrooge by George C. Scott.

WALTER ZELMAN

<TEXT>
<P>
Walter Zelman's political-therapy-revelations ("Why One Mr. Smith Couldn't Even 
Make It to Sacramento," Nov. 11) epitomize the malaise that has laid low the 
entire liberal bloc of the American political scene. 
</P>
<P>
His preoccupation with self-fulfillment apparently overshadows any concept of 
"serving the people." 
</P>
<P>
The narrative is, admittedly, entertaining. But this is due mainly to his 
divulging the fact that just about anyone may be successful in getting 
themselves on the ballot and, what is even more curious, getting people to give 
them money. 
</P>
<P>
If we learn nothing else from Zelman, here is a great tribute to the basis of 
our American democratic system.

WHERE IS MR. SMITH?

<TEXT>
<P>
Television is a big problem in American political apathy. We need to limit its 
use politically. 
</P>
<P>
There should be one week, and one week only, when candidates should be allowed 
on television. There should be a week of debates in which candidates' 
qualifications and backgrounds are discussed, when voters can see them over 
some time, not just in 30-second bites. 
</P>
<P>
If we insist that politicians not have access to television to manipulate, it 
will be a different world.

As a registered, turned-off, almost election-ignoring voter, I got a breath of 
fresh air from "Where Is Mr. Smith?" It was wonderful to find that there are 
Americans who care about conditions in this country (including Brownstein and 
Easton), who have some power to change things.

JACK SMITH ON SUNDAY: SPEAKING VOLUMES; 
</P>
<P>
BIG BOOKS LAND ON COFFEE TABLES, WHERE THEY'RE HARDLY EVER READ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ONE THING I DON'T WANT for Christmas is a coffee-table book. 
</P>
<P>
They are called coffee-table books, I suppose, because they are too big to go 
anyplace else, and they are expensive, lavishly illustrated books that are 
designed to catch the eye of the casual guest. 
</P>
<P>
In most of our houses, coffee-table books have the status of vases or 
sculptures. They are admired as objects, but to open one is to imply that one 
is bored with the company. 
</P>
<P>
My problem with coffee-table books is that our coffee table is covered with 
them already, to a depth of three, yet I have never seen any guest of ours open 
one, even for a cursory inspection. 
</P>
<P>
I suspect that our guests are more interested in drinks and gossip than in 
reading. As for me, I'm afraid I am too often seduced away from books by 
television. On television, the pictures talk and move. And it is easier to turn 
on the TV than to lift a four-pound book. 
</P>
<P>
Coffee-table books have a long shelf life, but some of them get out of date. 
One that now resides on our table is "The (London) Times Atlas of World 
History." The book is 11 inches high and 14 1/2 inches deep -- too large for 
any of our bookcases. It was inevitably consigned to the coffee table, where it 
has lain for months, unopened. It appears to be an excellent book, with maps of 
every historical period from the first farmers of 9000 BC to the present. 
</P>
<P>
From time to time, I find other places for our coffee-table books. I have 
already relocated a book about Maui, one on great Hollywood movies and one on 
Paris, a richly illustrated exploration of that exciting city. The jacket is a 
reproduction of Claude Monet's "Le Quai du Louvre," with the word Paris 
scrawled across the blue sky in lipstick red. 
</P>
<P>
That this book lay in plain sight on our coffee table for years without 
attracting the slightest interest suggests that the coffee table is not a 
successful setting for the display of books. 
</P>
<P>
Our most recent acquisition is "Westwind," a splendid example of the genre at 
its splashiest. "Westwind" is 12 1/2 inches high and 15 1/2 inches deep. It is 
the story of a small-boat odyssey down the West Coast from Cape Flattery to 
Ensenada. The text is by Walter Cronkite. The paintings, by his companion on 
the voyage, Ray Ellis, are fresh, pretty, lush, evocative and serene. I did not 
sample Cronkite's text, but I'm sure it is elegant. The book now resides on the 
coffee table, where it doubtless will remain in virginal neglect. 
</P>
<P>
It shares the table top with "A Day in the Country," a catalogue of the 
splendid exhibition of impressionist paintings at the Los Angeles County Museum 
of Art six years ago. The wraparound cover is a reproduction of Monet's "Train 
in the Countryside." It shows a quaint little passenger train puffing along a 
ridge behind trees and, below it, on the grass, a small child and a young woman 
with a parasol. 
</P>
<P>
You might think that cover would have seduced many of our guests into exploring 
the catalogue and feasting on the sensually pretty evocations of the French 
countryside it contains. I have always been especially enchanted by Monet's 
"Terrace at Sainte-Andresse." One can almost feel the breeze that blows the 
flags. So far as I know, the book has never been opened by anyone but me. 
</P>
<P>
Some years ago I tried testing my guests by placing an unusual book on the 
coffee table. It was an illustrated history of the Parisian bordello -- full of 
arresting portraits of ladies of the night and illuminated by a factual, 
sympathetic text. It remained on the table, in full sight, inviolate. 
</P>
<P>
I have no doubt that such books are designed and published with the certain 
knowledge that they will end up on coffee tables, never to be read or even 
looked at. Still, they are there. One never knows when a child, bored by adult 
chatter, may idly open one and be enchanted by a day in the French countryside 
or a stroll through Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Though I may ignore my own coffee-table books, I have a habit of picking up and 
thumbing through those in the homes of my hosts. Usually, when I am caught 
doing this, my host asks genially if I wouldn't like something from the bar, 
and I realize that I am being impolite. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, I do not want to let such social constraints keep me from 
enjoying the landmark products of the press. 
</P>
<P>
If anyone wants to give me a Gutenberg Bible, I accept.

RERUNS TO RE-WATCH: 'CREATURES' COMFORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, Times Staff Writer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
James Herriot has made the world a little brighter thanks to his charming, 
best-selling chronicles of his adventures as a country veterinarian in the 
picturesque Yorkshire dales of England. And for the past 12 years his 
delightful stories have been brought magically to life via the acclaimed 
British TV series All Creatures Great &amp; Small. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the appeal of "Creatures" is the cast: former Royal Shakespeare Company 
actor Christopher Timothy as Herriot, veteran character actor Robert Hardy as 
his crusty boss Siegfried Farnon and the winsome Peter Davison ("Campion") as 
Siegfried's womanizing younger brother Tristan. 
</P>
<P>
The series began airing on PBS syndication 11 years ago. KCET has shown the 
first 46 episodes off and on since 1979 (the rights are no longer available), 
and KOCE began airing the repeats earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
Arts &amp; Entertainment Network has been co-producing the series with the BBC 
for the past five seasons. This year, besides its usual 12 new episodes 
(currently in repeats on the cable network), A&amp;E is presenting a two-hour 
"Creatures" holiday special Monday, which finds Herriot dealing with an 
outbreak of deadly anthrax and Tristan falling for the local schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a lot of reasons why the series has been so popular," said 
Brooke Johnson, vice president of programming and production for A&amp;E. "The 
James Herriot books are very popular and the subject matter is unusual. It's 
not an action-adventure. They are soft, warm, human kind of programs, and 
there's not a whole lot of that on American TV. The execution is very good. 
It's beautiful to look at." 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;E originally aired the series late Sunday evenings but has moved it to 
early Saturday morning and evening. "We tended to get a somewhat older 
audience," she said. "But we moved it up earlier hoping to get a more family 
audience and so far, it has been pretty successful." 
</P>
<P>
"Creatures" fans will be happy to learn the latest batch of new episodes are 
scheduled to begin next month. But Johnson doesn't know how long the series 
will continue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tied directly to James Herriot," Johnson said. "The BBC has gone through 
all of his published works. With the new season, he is doing all the stories. 
It really depends on how willing he is to go forward, and without him, no one 
will go forward." 
</P>
<P>
"All Creatures Great &amp; Small Christmas Special" airs Monday at 5 and 9 p.m. 
on A&amp;E. The new season of "All Creatures Great &amp; Small" airs Saturdays 
at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. on A&amp;E. Repeat episodes of earlier seasons air 
Saturday at 7 p.m. on KOCE..

WE CAN BEGUILE ourselves with the fantasy that so-called Important Subjects 
occupy our minds, but it won't wash. For a while, I can write columns about 
subjects like politics or sports or race and pretend that I'm dealing with what 
"really" matters, but, you know, I'm not fooling anyone -- least of all myself. 
Every so often, a person's got to come clean, drop the facade and deal with the 
only thing that actually does matter around here: driving. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, that seems like a cliche assessment, on a par with the old Newsweek 
articles about people baking away their brains out in Lotusland (and this was 
before anybody actually drove a Lotus). But just look at the most recent 
election returns. 
</P>
<P>
We voted against spending money for schools. We voted against spending money to 
build prisons. Parkland? Forget about it. A new courthouse? You gotta be 
kidding. The environment? Let Chevron spend money to save it. We, the people, 
voted to spend money for only one purpose: to solve the traffic mess. If Big 
Green had promised to clear rush-hour traffic on the 91, it would have breezed 
through. 
</P>
<P>
Admittedly, what one might facetiously describe as "the system" doesn't work. 
Hard-core Caltransophiles might argue that's because we didn't persevere with 
the Original Plan. Caltrans prescribed quite an impressive system in theory; as 
I recall, it proposed a grid of freeways no farther apart from one another than 
four miles in any direction. Had the early planners had their way, you could 
have waved to somebody driving on the next freeway over. But the dream of a 
Southern California map decked out in tight freeway plaid is deader than Sam 
the Olympic Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
But given the constraints of our asphalt circulatory system, we still bear 
major blame for clotting it up like so many automotive platelets of bad 
cholesterol. We -- by which I mean everybody but me -- engage in such maneuvers 
as cruising ever so slowly in the fast lane of a boulevard for blocks on end 
until that left-turn pocket we've been searching for suddenly appears. We 
cheerfully block whole afternoonfuls of traffic by pulling into the right lane 
of a street and then insisting on bulldozing our way across the intervening 
lanes to the very next left-turn lane, out of panic that a parallel street 
affording a similar turn opportunity will never appear. 
</P>
<P>
We wait at long red lights, and then rouse ourselves so slowly from our slumber 
that only one or two of the fellow drivers behind us can take advantage of that 
same, all-too-brief green. We act, in short, in the solipsistic manner of one 
whose drivers' ed class pounded home this crucial lesson: Hey, cool ruler, 
you're the only one on the road! 
</P>
<P>
This assumes, of course, that we attended any such class. Actually, I blame the 
decline in the quality of local vehicular behavior on the influx of people who 
learned to drive primarily by watching "The Blues Brothers." Driving used to be 
embarrassingly good. Easterners would scoff at our polite, law-abiding ways as 
the ultimate proof of our hick pedigree. Conversely, I remember being amazed, 
on first arriving in Boston, that anyone could survive in a car there for more 
than 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The most obvious proof of our sad fall from automotive grace is the rupture of 
the social contract that used to govern relations with pedestrians. Woody Allen 
had too much emotion invested in the cultural superiority of spending 
afternoons in the Thalia Theatre to realize it, but allowing cars to turn right 
on red was, in fact, part of a coherent way of being. 
</P>
<P>
Certain privileges were ceded to the pedestrian (in recognition of his rare and 
endangered status), such as the absolute right to cross in the crosswalk, 
before which all drivers must stop. In return, the driver gained equal and 
complementary privileges, like the famous right turn on red. 
</P>
<P>
But like a chimpanzee trying to play Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," today's 
drivers have clumsily banged away at this stately and elegant balance. Stepping 
into a crosswalk now gives a pedestrian nothing more than the right to get 
exhaust burns on his jeans from the scofflaws speeding by. My personal 
crosswalk technique -- shared here purely for entertainment purposes and not to 
encourage similar behavior, so don't sue me if you get hit -- is to stare down 
oncoming drivers, relying on eye contact to revive the latent human impulse to 
not kill. Sometimes it works. 
</P>
<P>
But if it's everybody for himself, then we have to go all the way. Let 
pedestrians jaywalk or run for it any time they can. And drivers have to give 
up that precious right turn on red; that brief, safe time at the intersection 
becomes too crucial to sheer pedestrian survival. It's a coherent system, too 
-- the laws of the jungle, or Manhattan -- and it's coming our way. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the authorities help to degrade this state of affairs further. If 
nobody gets a ticket for plowing through red lights any more, it's Katie, bar 
the door. And who empowered city officials to remove the nickel from the list 
of legal coinage, as far as parking meters are concerned? 
</P>
<P>
But the core of the problem remains us -- that is, everybody but me. Let's work 
on it, shall we? Meantime, outta my way, babe. I'm late.

THE CHUTNEYS AND CHILI SAUCES on sale at the Siri Lanka Curry House in 
Hollywood really spice up a meal. 
</P>
<P>
Among the great Sri Lankan food discoveries available there are mango and apple 
chutney -- both sweet and hot. Apples don't grow in Sri Lanka, a tropical 
island located just off the southern tip of India, but co-owner Kusala 
Siriwardhane needed an alternative for the seasonal mango. 
</P>
<P>
The chutneys are priced at $5.95 each; chili sauces, $4.95. Packed in 
eight-ounce jars, they make ideal gifts for people with exotic tastes.

OUTTAKES: SECOND TIME AROUND

Critics liked it, but American moviegoers were less excited. So why did 
producer Dodi Fayed make a sequel to his 1986 thriller "F/X"? 
</P>
<P>
Fayed points to "F/X's" worldwide box-office tally: $55 million ($27 million 
from North America) -- a solid figure for a film shot for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
"F/X II," now in post-production for Orion Pictures, cost about $16 million. 
Set for March release, it again re-teams Bryan Brown as a movie special-effects 
man and Brian Dennehy as a tough cop. 
</P>
<P>
Fayed admits that he'd have preferred to have the sequel come out much closer 
to the original. But: "It has a big following. Brown and Dennehy say that for 
the past few years they're always asked (in interviews) about the sequel." 
</P>
<P>
The promo campaign, adds Fayed, will "remind audiences of the first film." 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Fayed is involved in the two Peter Pan projects, "Hook" and "Peter 
Pan." He had held "Peter Pan" rights since 1985 when he heard that Tri-Star 
Pictures was talking "Hook" with filmmaker Steven Spielberg. Consequently, 
Fayed is now executive producer of the Spielberg film, which stars Dustin 
Hoffman as Captain Hook and Robin Williams as a grown-up Peter Pan. 
</P>
<P>
Fayed hopes to begin production on a more traditional "Peter Pan" in the fall, 
also for Tri-Star, though no director or stars are yet attached. Pat H. Broeske

OUTTAKES: WAKE UP CALL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
So how does Dr. Oliver Sacks feel about Columbia Pictures' just-out 
"Awakenings," which chronicles his dramatic success in reviving a group of 
post-encephalitic patients from their catatonic states in 1969? 
</P>
<P>
"My reservations are very small, because the essential truth of that time was 
conveyed," he tells us. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted that the story of this event and these patients is being told 
again (there was a British documentary in 1973). These things were full of 
wonder at many levels." 
</P>
<P>
Director Penny Marshall's feature has fictionalized much of Sacks' own book, 
which recounts his work with patients who had been mute and virtually immobile 
for decades. Robin Williams portrays a doctor based loosely on Sacks, with 
Robert De Niro as his primary patient, who awakens after 30 years to a changed 
world and a challenging new life. 
</P>
<P>
Sacks, technical consultant on the film, says that the actors -- "especially De 
Niro" -- meticulously studied footage of the so-called "awakenings." De Niro 
"had an incredible empathy and (mastery) of detail," Sacks says. "At times, I 
would get totally taken in and forget he was an actor." 
</P>
<P>
Sacks is generally pleased with the film's depiction of behavior and events -- 
"This was not a documentary or reconstruction, though it's authentic in many 
ways" -- but remains unhappy that De Niro's character becomes violent in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
"My main reservation is the violence on Ward 5," Sacks says. "I got very angry 
about it. In fact, I walked off the set." 
</P>
<P>
He was less upset when screenwriter Steven Zaillian created a relationship 
between the doctor and a supportive nurse (played by Julie Kavner). 
</P>
<P>
"The nurse didn't exist," Sacks says. "She was an invention. 
</P>
<P>
"But what is Hollywood without a little love and violence?" John M. Wilson

PORTRAIT OF A PLANET

<TEXT>
<P>
Did everyone marvel at those stunning photos of clear-cut forests in "Portrait 
of a Planet" (Nov. 11)? I would be very surprised if the ongoing devastation in 
Northern California has nothing to do with the decrease in rainfall in Southern 
California since World War II. For what it's worth, I'm planting trees in my 
own yard, and I'll give them all the water they need, Bradley's 
10%-water-reduction decree be damned. If Central Valley farmers can throw away 
their cheap water running sprinklers in the noonday sun on surplus crops like 
cotton and alfalfa, I can take all the 15-minute showers I please.

Regarding "My Aching Back," by Michael S. Wilkes MD and Miriam Schuchman MD 
(Nov. 11): A point missed by the doctors was the mention of physical therapy 
for treatment of back injuries. Granted, there are good therapists and 
not-so-good therapists; however, care and education offered by physical 
therapists can be invaluable to the individual suffering back pain. With the 
use of ice, heat, ultrasound, electrical stimulation, stretching and 
strengthening exercises and general conditioning, back problems can be 
successfully rehabilitated and reinjury prevented.

STAGE WEEK: BIG PLANS FOR A DARK (NEW YEAR'S) NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though New Year's Eve is on a Monday next week -- normally a dark night for 
theaters -- a number of shows will offer special performances to ring in 1991: 
</P>
<P>
* At the Santa Monica Playhouse, Jerry Mayer's "Aspirin and Elephants" plays 
twice: the 6:30 p.m. performance ($35) includes hors d'oeuvres, champagne, 
party favors and noisemakers; the 9:30 show ($50) adds a midnight buffet. 
</P>
<P>
* The Groundlings host "Best of the Groundlings"; the $60 charge includes a 
buffet and champagne. 
</P>
<P>
* Sheri Glaser's "Family Secrets," at the Heliotrope Theatre, plays at 7 p.m. 
($25, including champagne) and 10 p.m. ($35, with champagne, hors d'oeuvres, 
and party). 
</P>
<P>
* Gena Rowlands and Ben Gazzara appear as the mismatched bluebloods in A. R. 
Gurney's "Love Letters," at the Canon Theatre, at 7 and 10 p.m. The $50 price 
tag includes sparkling cider. 
</P>
<P>
* The Globe Playhouse opens Shakespeare's "The Rape of Lucrece," followed by 
champagne and an open forum with the cast. Ticket prices range from $8.50 
("seniors and unemployed actors") to $25. 
</P>
<P>
* Besides the customary free-flowing champagne and buffet at "Tamara" at Il 
Vittoriale, patrons will be treated to music and dancing, psychics and tarot 
card readers, balloons, streamers, party favors and the traditional clock 
countdown to midnight. Tickets are $150 per person. 
</P>
<P>
Other shows playing on New Year's Eve -- but without special refreshments -- 
include "The Phantom of the Opera" at the Ahmanson Theatre, featuring the 
return of Michael Crawford (7 p.m.); "Finkel's Follies" closing at the Westwood 
Playhouse (5 and 9 p.m.); "Jerome Robbins' Broadway" at the Shubert Theatre (8 
p.m.); and Penn and Teller's "Refrigerator Tour" at the Wiltern Theatre (7 and 
11 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
For Christmas cheer, the Doolittle Theatre is offering $10 tickets for the Dec. 
25 performance of "The Heidi Chronicles," with Stephanie Dunnam in for the 
departed Amy Irving. 
</P>
<P>
GET REAL: Before we forge into the new year, a wrist-slap to a few local 
theater producers for indulging in some ill-conceived puffery. 
</P>
<P>
Recent press releases for the Santa Barbara Civic Light Opera refer to the 
organization as "last year's regional Tony finalist" and "the only dedicated 
musical theatre finalist for the 1989 national Regional Tony Award." 
</P>
<P>
There are no such animals. Any of the 200-plus members of the American Theatre 
Critics Assn. may suggest names of theaters for the regional Tony, and at least 
one member apparently suggested SBCLO last year. But ATCA recommends only one 
theater for the honor each year, without naming "finalists." It's safe to say 
that SBCLO -- which presents traditional musical revivals with largely 
non-Equity casts -- was hardly up there slugging it out with the eventual 
winner, Seattle Repertory Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
The Tony committee in New York makes the final decision, customarily accepting 
the critics' recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
Speaking of critics' recommendations, a recent trip to "A Peasant of El 
Salvador" at the Dynarski Theatre found a legal-sized flyer in the lobby, 
plastered with a Times banner, and below it, reprints of four local reviews. 
Two, from The Times and the L.A. Reader, were positive. Another two, from the 
L.A. Weekly and Drama-Logue, appeared positive. On closer inspection, however, 
the latter reviews proved to have been cut and pasted together -- with all 
negative comments neatly trimmed out. 
</P>
<P>
From the Drama-Logue "review": " . . . the cast is youthful and attractive and 
thoroughly persuaded by their cause. In this harmonious company there is not a 
moment of doubt, not a hint of real. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Here's that portion of Bruce Feld's actual review: "(The show's) childlike 
attempts to grapple with political and ethical themes are, paradoxically, 
rendered even more juvenile because the cast is youthful and attractive and 
thoroughly persuaded by their cause. In this harmonious company there is not a 
moment of doubt, not a hint of real dramatic conflict. There is, however, a 
constantly smug presentation of the kind of self-righteousness that gives 
martyrdom a bad name." 
</P>
<P>
Moving on to "A Pinch of Pinter With a Twist" at the Rose Theatre, in the 
program director-producer Leslie Byrne writes grandly of her new relationship 
with playwright Harold Pinter: "I made history when his office called from 
London requesting updates on rehearsels (sic) and the shows (sic) progress."

TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR GUIDE: A DOUBLE DOSE OF GARTH BROOKS IS A REAL DEEE-LITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Keeping up with what's fresh in pop music on a budget of $25 per month ($40 for 
CD fans). 
</P>
<P>
November 
</P>
<P>
Garth Brooks' "Garth Brooks" (Capitol) -- Brooks, the hottest newcomer in 
country music, is a good but not great singer -- and he's not able to always 
come up with dazzling material. But see him live -- where he sells his best 
songs with a genuineness that is hard to resist -- and you'll become a fan. 
</P>
<P>
Garth Brooks' "No Fences" (Capitol) -- Brooks has enough good material for one 
excellent album, but it's spread over two collections. After seeing him on 
stage, where he expresses country's blue-collar dreams and frustrations as well 
as anyone in a decade, you'll probably be willing to buy both albums so you can 
listen to the best songs. 
</P>
<P>
Deee-Lite's "World Clique" (Elektra) -- It's normally wise to avoid any group 
that begins its album with a self-introduction, but this New York-based trio 
overcomes the self-consciousness and delivers some of the year's most witty and 
inviting dance-pop, including "Groove Is in the Heart." The B-52's of the '90s? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
December 
</P>
<P>
Black Box's "Dreamland" (RCA) -- The framework of this dance music from Italy 
(dubbed "spaghetti house" by Q magazine), is conventional, but the beats are 
infectious and the key vocals bring a sensual edge to the music that is 
reminiscent of Gloria Gaynor's best disco-related work. 
</P>
<P>
Gear Daddies' "Billy's Live Bait" (Polydor) -- Martin Zellar's songs touch on 
the struggle between childhood ideals and adult responsibilities with an 
insight and conviction reminiscent of Paul Westerberg and Bob Forrest, and it 
is delivered with a lonesome rock intensity that keeps drawing you back. One of 
the year's 10 best albums. See Page 71. 
</P>
<P>
Lush's "Gala" (4AD/Reprise) -- Don't let the recent New Musical Express cover 
story comparing this British group to ABBA fool you into thinking you'll find 
another "Fernando" or "Dancing Queen" here. But "Gala" -- with its harsher 
textures and tales of stained innocence -- offers deliciously appealing 
art-pop.

RECORD RACK: TRESVANT COULD COME ON STRONGER; 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 RALPH TRESVANT "RALPH TRESVANT"MCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONNIE JOHNSON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As the last member of New Edition to record a solo project, Tresvant -- always 
the group's resident heartthrob -- must have felt a bellyfull of nerves when he 
decided to do this album. The results are respectable if a bit formulaic and 
unfocused, never really surpassing the monster he-man grooves of former 
groupmate Bobby Brown's solo smashes, and too laid back to wallop the 
misogyny-with-a-backbeat hits of Bell Biv DeVoe. 
</P>
<P>
Tresvant's R&amp;B traditionalist style is most similar to that of New 
Edition's Johnny Gill. Both of them are closer to the old-fashioned soul man 
approach of a Jackie Wilson or Otis Redding than they are to the new jack swing 
posture of their young contemporaries in black music. 
</P>
<P>
While not as bold as Brown or adventurous as Bell Biv Devoe, Tresvant is not 
without his strong points. On "Stone Cold Gentleman" and the Jimmy Jam and 
Terry Lewis-produced "Sensitivity," he extends a near-irresistible invitation, 
presenting himself as a dreamy-eyed antidote to the heavy-handed women bashers 
of the world. Jam and Lewis produced one other radio-worthy track, "Rated R," 
and against its rap-laced incendiary beat, Tresvant comes on stronger still. If 
only the rest of the album contained this much fire, freshness and new jack 
nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) to five (a classic).

POP EYE: A BANNER YEAR FOR GREED, FOOLISHNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when you thought rock 'n roll couldn't possibly get any sillier, along 
came . . . Milli Vanilli. 
</P>
<P>
But the disgraced pop hunks who were stripped of their Grammy after admitting 
they didn't actually sing on their multiplatinum album, weren't the only rock 
icons whose music turned out to be far less important than their marketing 
image. In fact, you could call 1990 the year of the Big Sell -- or the Big Sell 
Out -- as pop stars hyped themselves with a vengeance. 
</P>
<P>
The tackiest pitchman of all: M. C. Hammer. When rap's reigning kingpin 
accepted his Best Rap Song trophy at the MTV Awards broadcast, he made sure 
everyone knew he'd signed a lucrative deal to hype soft drinks by plugging his 
new sponsor and waving a Pepsi can at the podium. 
</P>
<P>
The most earnest pitchmen: New Kids on the Block. The teen idols had a string 
of hits this year (they have four albums in the Top 100 right now). But they 
made even more money with an incredible series of merchandising deals valued at 
upwards of $400 million (in other words, more than what Jose Canseco, Madonna 
and Jack Nicholson make in a year combined). 
</P>
<P>
And the Hamlet of pitchmen had to be George Michael. In interviews to hype his 
new album, the Three-Day Bearded One complained so much about how stardom had 
made him miserable that he received a stinging rebuke from no less an authority 
than Frank Sinatra, who advised: "Come on, George. Loosen up. Swing, man. . . . 
You're top dog on the top rung of a tall ladder called Stardom, which in Latin 
means thanks-to-the-fans who were there when it was lonely." 
</P>
<P>
And 1990 offered plenty of spills and thrills as well, whether it was Axl Rose 
being arrested on charges that he hit his neighbor with a wine bottle (the 
charges were later dropped) or Faith No More singer Mike Patton, who was 
questioned by Australian customs officials for smuggling a pair of fake breasts 
into the country (the eagle-eyed customs crew confiscated the falsies, which 
Patton planned to use in the band's stage show). Any way you view it, it was a 
banner year for pop follies. To celebrate the music world's clown princes, Pop 
Eye presents its yearly round-up of dubious achievements, inglorious moments 
and showbiz misadventures: 
</P>
<P>
HIP-HOP FAN OF THE YEAR: Former president Richard Nixon, who says in a taped 
memoir at his new Richard Nixon Museum: "When I was seven, I started taking 
music lessons . . . and learned to play the violin, the clarinet, the saxophone 
and recorder. I've often thought that if there had been a good rap group around 
in those days, I might have chosen a career in music instead of politics." 
</P>
<P>
ELVIS QUOTE OF THE YEAR: When ABC-TV canceled its "Elvis" series this spring, 
citing poor ratings, "Elvis" producer Alan Spenser observed: "Isn't it 
interesting that people see Elvis in 7-11s, Laundromats and Burger King, but no 
one watches him Sunday night at 8:30 on ABC." 
</P>
<P>
CHEF OF THE YEAR: Gourmet chef Carmen Bonnilla quit after only a month as 
Prince's personal cook, complaining that the pop star, while professing to be a 
vegetarian, wouldn't eat any salads or vegetables. "He eats a lot of junk 
food," Bonnilla said. "I have the feeling it's going to catch up with him." 
</P>
<P>
GENTLEMEN OF THE YEAR: After hearing that Deniece Wells had been arrested for 
using the men's room at a George Strait concert this fall, the members of Ratt 
sent the Houston woman free tickets to their show -- and an all-access 
laminated backstage pass saying she could use the group's men's room anytime. 
</P>
<P>
PROMO MAN OF THE YEAR: MCA Records promo exec Billy Brill, asked why he got 
into the record business, explained: "Since I was Jewish, I couldn't be a gym 
teacher -- I didn't look good in short pants and a whistle." 
</P>
<P>
CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE YEAR: When Harper &amp; Row signed the Grateful Dead's 
Mickey Hart to write a new opus called "Drumming on the Edge of Magic," the 
publishing house had to agree to a "tree clause" in Hart's book contract 
stipulating that Harper &amp; Row plant a pair of saplings in a needy rain 
forest for every tree used to provide paper for the book. 
</P>
<P>
GRAMMY BEST NEW ARTIST OF THE YEAR: To Mrs. Gooch's meat counter store clerk 
Mick Rechtien, who crooned the National Anthem to pop diva Sinead O'Connor 
(after she'd refused to allow "The Star-Spangled Banner" to be performed before 
a concert in New Jersey). Rechtien was subsequently fired for harassing her. 
</P>
<P>
WACKO OF THE YEAR: As always, to Michael Jackson, who was one of many showbiz 
luminaries to appear in the documentary, "Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy 
Jones," but the only one to insist that his interview be filmed completely in 
the dark. (His interviewer is shown holding a flashlight on her list of 
questions.) 
</P>
<P>
QUOTE OF THE YEAR: John Connors, a Chicago-based vocalist who makes a living 
doing Frank Sinatra vocal impressions, admitted: "I've always thought that I 
sounded much more like Frank Sinatra Jr. than I do his father. But is there a 
market for a Frank Sinatra Jr. impersonator? I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
SEPARATED AT BIRTH, PART ONE: Perhaps because they both wear dreadlock-style 
hairdos, Lenny Kravitz is sometimes mistaken for Ziggy Marley, son of the late 
reggae legend Bob Marley. (Lenny's father is a TV producer named Sy Kravitz.) 
Sure enough, when Lenny was walking the beach in the Bahamas this year, he was 
approached by an excited fan, who told him: "You know, your father was such an 
inspiration. He meant so much to me -- he was the greatest!" Lenny eyed the fan 
and said, "Sy?" 
</P>
<P>
SEPARATED AT BIRTH, PART TWO: In a pop round-up piece, GQ Magazine ran a 
picture of Bob Mould but identified the thrash-rocker in the caption as being 
country songstress k.d. lang. 
</P>
<P>
POP EVANGELIST OF THE YEAR: MCA Records president Richard Palmese, asked why he 
gave up studying for the priesthood to join the record industry, explained: "I 
found it was easier to convince people a song was a hit . . . than convince 
them that there was a God." 
</P>
<P>
BEACH BOYS FAN OF THE YEAR: Just before he died earlier this year, Andy, 
"Doonesbury's" wisecracking AIDS patient, scrawled these words on a scrap of 
paper: "Brian Wilson is God!" To which his doctor responded: "Oh, he must have 
heard the 'Pet Sounds' CD." 
</P>
<P>
OVER-ENTHUSIASTIC CENSOR OF THE YEAR: The Pacific Northwest-based record store 
chain, Meyer Music Markets, slapped an objectionable lyrics warning sticker on 
Frank Zappa's "Jazz From Hell" album, despite the fact that it was an 
all-instrumental disc. 
</P>
<P>
MATHEMATICIANS OF THE YEAR: Motown Records staged its "Motown 30" birthday 
celebration this fall, even though the record label's lavish 25th anniversary 
special took place in . . . 1983. 
</P>
<P>
IMPOSTERS OF THE YEAR: Milli Vanilli. Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
LISTENING PARTY OF THE YEAR: Arista chief Clive Davis' lavish October bash in 
the Grand Ballroom at New York's Regency Hotel, where 200 guests were forced to 
sit in folding chairs and listen to every track of the new Whitney Houston 
album, complete with gushing introductions for each song from Davis himself. 
</P>
<P>
I.Q. OF THE YEAR: Accused of hiding subliminal messages in his songs that drove 
two youths to suicide, Judas Priest guitarist K. K. Downing told the press 
after leaving the courtroom one day: "I didn't know what a subliminal message 
was until this case came up. It'll be another 10 years before I can even spell 
subliminal."

POP FACES: THE RINGLINGS: 'PUNK ROCK WITH A SMILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hollywood do-it-yourself rock is back in the big time. 
</P>
<P>
The Ringling Sisters, which includes former members of the Bangles and the 
Screaming Sirens -- two key female groups of L.A.'s early-'80s grass-roots 
movement -- has released "60 Watt Reality." 
</P>
<P>
The album, on Ode Records through A&amp;M, is the first big-label release from 
a representative of that milieu in ages. But though the faces may be familiar, 
the attitudes and sounds -- a mix of semi-folky-rock and spoken-word pieces -- 
may not. 
</P>
<P>
"People will come up to me and say, 'I can't believe you're into this 
coffeehouse thing,' " said Pleasant Gehman, one of the female rocker-poets who 
founded the Ringlings in 1987. "They say, 'I remember when you used to be 
vomiting in the clubs all night.' " 
</P>
<P>
Still, Gehman, who just recently broke up the Screaming Sirens to devote more 
time to the Ringling Sisters, says that the methodology is drawn directly from 
the old days. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like punk rock," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Punk rock with a smile," added Gary Eaton, one of the group's two male 
guitarists, sitting with Gehman and the other Sisters after a recent acoustic 
performance at the funky Melrose store Y-Que. 
</P>
<P>
The group was founded as an informal, spoken-word enterprise by several L.A. 
rock women in need of creative alternatives to their regular bands. Among the 
original Sisters were Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Texacala Jones of 
Tex &amp; the Horseheads and Iris Berry of the Lame Flames. The point was to be 
able to write and perform without the encumberances and responsibilities of the 
full-time bands. 
</P>
<P>
"With the Ringling Sisters we escaped from rock 'n' roll hell," Gehman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the group itself became a real band, though retaining the 
do-it-yourself ethos, even now with its own major-label connection. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not waiting for A&amp;M to do promotional displays in record stores," 
said Debbie Patino, a former member of Raszebrae and current lead singer of 
Mercury's Flowers, as well as a Ringling. "We're doing it ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
And all the Ringlings remain active in other bands or otherwise involved with 
the local club scene. Annette Zilinskas was an original member of both the 
Bangles and Blood on the Saddle and currently leads Weatherbell. Debbie Dexter, 
Eaton and Dave Catching are all in the Devil Squares. And Patino, in addition 
to being in two bands, manages two others: Carnival Art and Everything. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of the group's grass-roots activities has always been its 
semi-annual benefit "Fun-Raisers" for a Hollywood home for orphaned and abused 
children. 
</P>
<P>
With all that, the Ringlings are something of the hub of a new L.A. grass-roots 
movement, though the group members, having survived the old grass-roots scene, 
are wary of such talk. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we're in any 'scene,' " said Dexter. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe we're forming our own state," added Eaton. "We seceded from the Union."

Thirty-two-year-old Debra Kreps says (Letters, Dec. 16) if she lives to 75 she 
"will never understand why people in show business think people not in show 
business even care an iota about Hollywood and its power struggles." 
</P>
<P>
At 74, I can save her 43 years worth of worrying by giving her the answer now 
in a single word: Ego.

I find Sinead O'Connor's courage and honesty inspiring ("Nothing Compares 2 Her 
Year," by Robert Hilburn, Dec. 16). But I'm puzzled about her regret for 
avoiding a potentially uncomfortable experience with "Saturday Night Live." 
</P>
<P>
Why should she beat herself up on the censorship issue? Media veterans who care 
about honesty can tell you that sometimes the line between editing and 
censorship gets fine.

BANDS THAT DON'T MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Out of the numerous letters I'm sure you received regarding Robert Hilburn's 
article on the "20 Bands That Matter," did anyone ask, "Does anyone really 
care?" 
</P>
<P>
If Springsteen, U2 and Guns N' Roses are bands that matter, please let me place 
my hat over my heart and state "Rock is dead." Pseudo-political lyrics, 
three-chord songs and bad attitudes don't a band make. 
</P>
<P>
Like most, I'm in no position to pick 20 bands that matter. In fact, I'm a KISS 
fan. But heck, I wouldn't even think of putting them on the same list as Elton 
John, the Who, James Brown and others. This leads me to wonder why Mr. Hilburn 
continually puts Springsteen on his lists. . . .

MR. NEWMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Kenneth Turan's commentary on Paul Newman (Calendar, Dec. 2): For all 
I know, Paul Newman might be fantastic in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." I haven't seen 
that film. 
</P>
<P>
In his autobiography, "An Open Book," John Huston relates how he first offered 
one of the leads in "The Man Who Would Be King" to Newman. Newman thought that 
the leads should be played by two Englishmen, and recommended Michael Caine and 
Sean Connery for the parts. 
</P>
<P>
I guess in this case Newman did not think that it would be wise to stretch 
himself for that role. If Newman had enough integrity to remove himself from a 
good role because he believed that there was someone else more appropriate for 
the part, then your critic has the right to legitimately raise the issue as to 
Newman's casting in "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge," whether or not we agree with his 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, he has the right and duty to raise that issue at any time, 
concerning any actor and any film. If he doesn't, he is depriving the reader of 
his thoughts. Yes, freedom of expression also applies to critics.

NEGLECTED WESTERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Michael Wilmington is right in pointing out that "Dances With Wolves" is not 
unique in depicting sympathy for Indians on the screen. However, I'd like to 
add two films to the list by which he supports his claim. 
</P>
<P>
In 1932, Columbia indulged its Western star, Col. Tim McCoy, and let him make 
"End of the Trail." An authority on Indians -- he was the adjutant general of 
Wyoming when he was hired as an adviser for the making of "The Covered Wagon" 
(1923) -- McCoy laid it on the line in this obscure little Western. At one 
point in a long speech he says (and the words were his own): "From the time 
this government began dealing with the Indians it has never kept a single 
treaty it has made with them." 
</P>
<P>
The other film is the well known "They Died With Their Boots On," starring 
Errol Flynn as Custer. While it's a storybook glorification of that flamboyant 
soldier it does allow for Indian dignity, bravery and intelligence. Anthony 
Quinn's portrayal of Crazy Horse belongs on Wilmington's list. 
</P>
<P>
I quibble with Wilmington on only one point -- his admiration for Arthur Penn's 
"Little Big Man," to my mind a ludicrous account of the Indian Wars. Penn's 
depiction of Custer as a cowardly lunatic is disgraceful. Custer was many 
things, some far from admirable, but he was not a lunatic nor a coward. And 
neither were all soldiers brutal and stupid, as Kevin Costner seems to suggest 
in his otherwise splendid film.

Instead of the National Organization for Women, NOW should stand for the 
Notorious Organization of Whiners, as it is making a big deal out of a trashy, 
insignificant book. 
</P>
<P>
By drumming up tons of free publicity for "American Psycho," NOW is defeating 
its primary purpose of trying to persuade people not to buy the book, because 
people who ordinarily wouldn't read it probably now will just out of curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
If NOW had left this piece of trash alone, "Psycho" would probably have died a 
quiet, uneventful death, much like Bret Ellis' previous book. 
</P>
<P>
Although NOW claims that this book degrades women because women are tortured, 
dismembered, mutilated, raped and murdered by the score, it also doesn't really 
do much for the image of men because it makes men appear to be a bunch of 
sadistic, cold-blooded killers.

Regarding the furor over Bret Easton Ellis' third novel: When mediocre prose no 
longer draws readers, a desperate writer may resort to shock value. Such is the 
case with Ellis, whose second book was a miserable failure. 
</P>
<P>
What a pity he chose resorting to gross and mean-spirited material instead of 
striving to be a better writer. And Ellis, in lazy and cowardly fashion, chose 
an easy target -- women, who still provide disturbingly easy victims in 
literature and life. 
</P>
<P>
What confuses me is why the National Organization for Women plays into Ellis' 
hands, particularly with the phone hot line allowing callers to hear excerpts 
of this warped material. Objecting to Ellis' misogyny and boycotting his books 
are fine. Giving him free publicity by making his brutality available to all 
with just a phone call seems counterproductive. 
</P>
<P>
You can't censor Bret Easton Ellis. So why not just ignore him? Don't buy his 
book.

Indulging in a rare quiet morning, I drank a cup of coffee while reading your 
report on "American Psycho" and watching my 7-month-old daughter discover her 
world. With the news of Ellis' third novel going into print, my nervous system 
began to feel as if nuclear fission were about to take place. 
</P>
<P>
Once again he will be spreading his gangrenous ooze under the disguise of 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
About five years ago, I was having a cafe au lait in Montparnasse with an 
"intellectual" architect. He handed me a book and in his French accent touted 
it as "fabulous . . . really American . . . culture, pop, great visuals. . . ." 
(Ellis') "Less Than Zero" was making its underground debut in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
As I read the book, I felt humiliated, abused, sick to my stomach and 
frightened by an insensitive, uncaring and dangerously greedy brat who was 
6,000 miles away. The ugly American had grown more ugly. 
</P>
<P>
Care must be taken not to make Ellis a cult hero.

I am appalled by the excerpts I've read from "American Psycho" and hope no one 
reads it. However, as a bookseller and a supporter of NOW, I cannot condone a 
blanket boycott of Random House. 
</P>
<P>
Does NOW really wish to imply that all Random House's publications are tainted 
by a single book? Vintage (a Random House imprint) publishes authors like 
Angela Davis, Antonia Fraser, Maxine Hong Kingston and Kazuo Ishiguro. 
</P>
<P>
Under other imprints, Random House publishes thousands of books. Should I not 
sell "Babar the Elephant," "The Random House Dictionary" or John Updike's 
novels? How about Margaret Drabble or A.S. Byatt? 
</P>
<P>
Even if Random House didn't publish such an extensive and impressive list, I 
could not condone a boycott. Each book is a separate work and should be judged 
in its own right. I sincerely hope "American Psycho" sinks as did Ellis' last 
novel. But with all this publicity, I fear more and more people will hear 
about, buy and read his offensive book.

'It's a mistaken idea that animals know what is poisonous. . . . Unfortunately, 
a number of pets are poisoned by plants, and the diagnosis is missed because 
the unsuspecting owner doesn't realize the pet has ingested a toxic plant. 
</P>
<P>
CHRISTOPHER CAUBLE 
</P>
<P>
Veterinarian 
</P>
<P>
Pets can wreak havoc with a garden. And vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
Numerous plants, including many natives and so-called weeds, can be harmful, 
even fatal, to companion animals, and pet-loving gardeners must know which ones 
they are. 
</P>
<P>
"The No. 1 problem plant for toxicity in this region is oleander," said William 
Emboden, a professor of biology at Cal State Northridge and the author of 
numerous botany books. 
</P>
<P>
"Every part of oleander is toxic, even when dried, and ingesting just one leaf 
can even kill a human," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oleander is a common sight in Southern California because the drought-tolerant 
plant is widely used as a hedge. While small animals usually leave it alone, 
there are many cases of horses and cattle eating oleander. 
</P>
<P>
"Daturas are another species which is deadly, and should be treated with 
extreme caution," Emboden said. 
</P>
<P>
Evergreen shrubs that can be trained to grow as small trees, daturas are also 
known as Angel's Trumpet or Brugmansia and are closely related to the native 
California annuals or perennials, jimson weeds. 
</P>
<P>
The large tubular flowers, usually white, are highly fragrant and very 
poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
"One variety, Datura inoxia, a perennial herbaceous shrub, is the most 
dangerous because the velvety leaves contain toxins at the surface," Emboden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"An animal, or human, can be affected just by touching their leaves. Cats, 
which would not normally eat this plant, can be harmed just by walking by and 
brushing the leaves." 
</P>
<P>
Research during the past decade has revealed that many plants have developed 
the ability to deter insects and herbivorous animals from munching on them by 
developing toxins. In this co-evolution process, the animals have developed 
methods of detoxification to protect themselves from the toxins in the plants 
they do consume. 
</P>
<P>
However, dogs and cats haven't developed these self-protective mechanisms, and 
puppies and kittens, particularly, are at great risk because they explore their 
world with their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
"So many hundreds of plants can be toxic, and as a rule, puppies are more 
aggressive and less discriminating about what they eat, so they're usually at 
risk," said Dr. Francis Galey, a specialist in veterinary toxicology at UC 
Davis. "They will chew on seeds, bulbs, branches, pits, and even leaves." 
</P>
<P>
"Plant toxicity varies according to the season. We get a number of calls at 
Christmas because mistletoe and holly berries are deadly to animals and too 
many people don't know it." 
</P>
<P>
He added that some plants have an undeserved reputation for toxicity. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, poinsettia has been labeled as toxic, but latest research has shown 
that the plant it not highly toxic. However, it does cause vomiting in the 
animals that eat it and for that reason pets should be prevented from access to 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Galey also pointed out that pet owners sometimes become confused when they see 
their pet eating a plant and then vomiting, mistaking an effect for the cause 
of pet poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
"Since dogs and cats will try to ingest grasses or other greenery if they have 
gastrointestinal upsets, which cause them to vomit, the unknowing pet owner may 
think the plant has caused the vomiting when in reality it didn't," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's always best to be cautious and check with a veterinarian." 
</P>
<P>
There is a widely held -- but erroneous -- belief that animals possess a native 
wisdom or intuition that keeps them from eating poisonous substances. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a mistaken idea that animals know what is poisonous and won't consume 
anything that is," said veterinarian Christopher Cauble, who operates Mobile 
Vet and treats his animal patients in their home environment. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, a number of pets are poisoned by plants, and the diagnosis is 
missed because the unsuspecting owner doesn't realize the pet has ingested a 
toxic plant," he said. "Because I see the animals in their own homes, it's 
possible to determine if the animal is sick because of what it consumed." 
</P>
<P>
Recently, he was called to euthanize a Great Dane dying of kidney failure. The 
dog wasn't responding to medication, and the underlying cause of the kidney 
failure couldn't be determined. The owner didn't want to see his dog suffer any 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were in the garden, deciding on the most suitable spot for burial, I 
spotted large quantities of pigweed and questioned the dog's owner why it was 
growing there," Cauble said. 
</P>
<P>
"He explained that the dog had enjoyed chewing on the plant, and I knew that 
was the source of the problem. The plant contains toxic amounts of oxalates 
that form crystals in the dog's kidneys. Unfortunately, it was too late to cure 
him." 
</P>
<P>
Charla and John Hutcheson were more fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
They live in Arcadia near the Los Angeles County Arboretum, and their garden 
was overrun with gophers. They decided to plant gopher spurge, a type of 
euphorbia. It did rid their garden of gophers, and almost killed their 
3-month-old Tibetan mastiff. 
</P>
<P>
"Because Maharenee chewed everything she could, I didn't permit her in my 
garden alone," Charla Hutcheson said. "I was outside with her, and just took my 
eyes off her for an instant. She consumed half a gopher spurge plant before I 
could stop her. I was uneasy for two days since I knew the plant caused 
hemorrhaging in gophers. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure enough, in just a few days I saw her bloody stools and summoned Dr. 
Cauble to treat her. Fortunately, since we knew the reason for the problem, we 
medicated her and saved her life. But I was annoyed that the mail order company 
that sells this plant claims it won't harm domestic animals. Obviously, that's 
not true." 
</P>
<P>
Since the Hutchesons still needed the gopher spurge to protect their garden, 
they protected Maharenee by building an enclosed patio in which she was 
confined when she wanted to be outside. 
</P>
<P>
Toxicity in plants is complicated by the fact that not all parts of the plants 
may be toxic, or they may be toxic just at certain times of the year. The 
amount consumed is also relevant, for with the exception of oleander (Nerium 
oleander) and castor beans (Ricinus communis), one bite is rarely fatal. 
</P>
<P>
"If a pet owner suspects plant poisoning, it's best to rush the animal to the 
family veterinarian or local emergency pet hospital," advised Dr. Barbara Hook, 
a certified veterinary toxicologist with the Los Angeles County Veterinarian's 
Office. 
</P>
<P>
"People should be aware that there's a big difference between animal and human 
systems, and some surprising things are poisonous to pets. For example, onions 
can be deadly to animals and, of course, are safe for human consumption." 
</P>
<P>
She also suggested that if at all possible, the pet owner should take a sample 
of the vomitus to the veterinarian. "The sample will usually contain the 
ingested plant, and the vet can save valuable time by seeing what actually made 
the animal sick," she said. Take the plant as well for identification. 
</P>
<P>
Although dogs and cats are the most common companion pets, other pets such as 
rabbits, birds and turtles should also be safeguarded from plants that are 
labeled as toxic. While hundreds of plants are considered toxic, the following 
are the most likely to be found in Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
Azaleas and rhododendrons (Rhododendron spp.) -- Large quantities of the green 
leaves must be ingested before lethal poisoning occurs. 
</P>
<P>
Boxwood (Buxus) -- These evergreen shrubs are widely used for hedging and 
edging. All parts are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Castor bean (Ricinus communis) -- The seeds are very toxic and just two can 
kill a human. Since only the seeds are toxic, this popular, fast-growing shrub 
can be safely included in the garden by removing the flowering head from the 
plant. 
</P>
<P>
Datura -- also known as Angel's Trumpet. All Datura species are poisonous. 
Jimson weed (Datura stramonium) is an abundant native of this region. Its seeds 
are most likely to cause toxicity in pets. 
</P>
<P>
English Ivy (Hedera helix) -- Although both the foliage and fruits are toxic, 
the poisonings reported have been from the fruits. 
</P>
<P>
Heavenly bamboo (Nandina domestica) -- The leaves contain cyanide. 
</P>
<P>
Larkspur (Delphinium) -- All species of larkspur and delphinium should be 
considered poisonous. The plants are most toxic in their early growth and seed 
stages. 
</P>
<P>
Monkshood (Aconitum napellus) -- Also known as wolf bane, it was cultivated in 
Europe for centuries and used to poison wolves. 
</P>
<P>
Oleander (Nerium oleander) -- Because oleander is bitter, animals rarely eat 
it. But puppies and kittens may be at risk if allowed to play among its dried 
leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Ornamental tobacco (Nicotiana) -- Nicotiana is a fragrant flowering ornamental 
in the tobacco family that, although toxic, rarely causes death in the animal 
ingesting it because the nicotine is absorbed slowly in the body. 
</P>
<P>
Oxalis -- There are many varieties of this low-growing perennial, and one is 
such an aggressive grower in this region that it's considered a weed. All 
species contain oxalates. 
</P>
<P>
Pigweed (Amaranthus spp.) -- A member of the Amaranth family, grown for 
ornamental leaves and grain, Pigweed is considered a weed and contains 
oxalates. 
</P>
<P>
Purple foxglove (Digitalis purpurea) -- the leaves are poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
Spurges (Euphorbiaceae) -- Besides gopher spurge, other types of euphorbia are 
poisonous. Perhaps the most widely known is poinsettia. Its milky sap irritates 
skin and gastrointestinal tracts of puppies, kittens, and birds. 
</P>
<P>
Yew (Taxus spp.) -- Both the foliage and twigs are toxic. 
</P>
<P>
Additionally, many popular garden ornamentals are grown from bulbs or corms, 
and these can be poisonous. The bulbs of tulips, daffodils, amaryllis and iris 
should be stored and planted where pets can't have access to them. 
</P>
<P>
New research reveals that feeding avocados to birds, rabbits and cats can cause 
severe toxic reactions, and even death in birds. Apricot and peach pits contain 
cyanide, and pets should never be allowed to consume them. 
</P>
<P>
Some vegetables too can be toxic to animals. These include spinach, rhubarb 
stalks, potato vines, onions and tomatoes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons poisoning by plants goes undetected in companion 
animals is that it's difficult to diagnose by symptoms alone. Different plant 
toxins affect the gastrointestinal system, the nervous system, or the 
circulatory system. 
</P>
<P>
Also, pets are poisoned more often by insect or rodent poisons than they are by 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
But with careful planning, it's possible to enjoy gardens and pets without harm 
to either. Know what you grow, and as a general precaution, don't permit pets 
free access to a garden containing any plants that can be potentially harmful 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Toxic Plants in the Home 
</P>
<P>
Some houseplants can also be toxic. Kittens and cats confined indoors are at 
risk because they're likely to chew plant leaves when they're bored, playing or 
even teething. Puppies will also consume plants, in addition to other prized 
household items. 
</P>
<P>
Pet birds will also spend a good deal of their time chewing, tasting and 
nibbling. If they have access to plants, they'll include them in their 
explorations. 
</P>
<P>
The following houseplants are considered toxic: Cutleaf philodendron, 
dieffenbachia (dumb cane), elephant ear (taro), eucalyptus (dried or partially 
dried, which are dyed or chemically treated for flower arrangements), holly, 
mistletoe, philodendrons, poinsettia and pyracantha.

APARTMENT LIFE: $850 RENT TOO HIGH TO GET RELOCATION FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, Postema is the editor of Apartment Age Magazine, a 
publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles (AAGLA), an apartment 
owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My husband and I moved into our Beverly Hills duplex and signed a 
one-year lease in 1982. When the lease expired, our landlady said she preferred 
to keep us as tenants on a month-to-month rental agreement instead of a lease. 
The rent was $850 a month. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, the ownership of the duplex has changed hands twice. Each time the 
owners have kept us as month-to-month tenants without a lease. The new owner 
recently told us that he bought the building with the intention of tearing it 
down to build a large apartment complex. He said that he will give us a 90-day 
notice to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
My question is, does he have to pay us a relocation fee? If he does have to pay 
the fee, how much are we entitled to? We have a pretty low rent, which is hard 
to find in Beverly Hills. It will be difficult to find something this good at 
the price. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: According to the Beverly Hills Rent Stabilization Office, "Relocation 
fees are payable only to tenants who moved into their units with rents under 
$600 a month. If the rent was over $600 at the time you moved in, you are not 
entitled to any relocation fee." 
</P>
<P>
The amount of relocation fees in Beverly Hills is $5,000 for seniors, the 
handicapped or the mentally ill. Others get $2,500. 
</P>
<P>

Helpful Tenants Gets Bill for Early Move 
</P>
<P>
Q: I live in Oceanside, and I had a lease that was supposed to run until Jan. 
31, 1991. Due to health and parking problems, I gave a notice on Oct. 15 of my 
intent to vacate the premises by Nov. 30, or as soon as a replacement tenant 
could be found. 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 1, the manager of the building said that a replacement tenant had been 
found for Nov. 15. He asked me if I could please be out before then to 
accommodate the replacement renter. I agreed and worked very hard to get out by 
the morning of Nov. 14. 
</P>
<P>
When I gave the manager the keys, he told me that the new tenant would not be 
moving in until Nov. 25. Now, the landlord has withheld my security deposit and 
is billing me for delinquent rent from November 15 to 25. 
</P>
<P>
Is this legal? It seems unfair to me. I moved ahead of my schedule at extra 
expense to myself to help them out. Since I am always an excellent tenant, I am 
angered at being called delinquent. Is there anything that I can do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. If you have the request in writing from the manager that he asked you 
move out by Nov. 15, or if he admits it, you probably have a good case for 
small claims court. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't have the manager's request in writing, the verbal contract that 
you seem to have made with him would still appear to be binding. It just 
depends upon who the judge believes, assuming in court the manager denies 
making the request to you to move out early. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Apartment Move-Out Time Is by Midnight 
</P>
<P>
Q: Earlier this year I was a tenant in an apartment in Long Beach. I gave a 
30-day notice of my intention to move and I was out of the unit at 8 a.m. on 
the day following the 30th day of the notice to vacate. 
</P>
<P>
The owner said that he was charging me an extra day's rent. He said the 
check-out time was supposed to be at midnight the night before. My impression 
was that checkout time was around 11 a.m. Is it proper for the landlord to take 
an extra day's rent from me in this situation? Can you recommend a course of 
action so that I can recover the rent for this day? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unlike most hotels and motels, most apartments operate on the midnight 
standard. Unless you had something in writing or a verbal understanding 
indicating something different, there is possibly not much chance of your 
recovering the day's rent in small claims court, where you would bring such a 
legal action.

AT HOME: WINDS OF CHANGE BLOW THROUGH L.A'S HARBOR AREA; 
</P>
<P>
SAN PEDRO: EVEN AS FISHING AND CANNING INDUSTRIES HAVE DECLINED, NEW RESIDENTS 
HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO COMMUNITY'S LOCATION BY THE SEA.

Bill Olesen was 8-years-old when he arrived by train at San Pedro's waterfront 
in 1912. 
</P>
<P>
His eyes sparkle as he recalls the steam locomotive puffing to a halt at the 
water's edge on the very spot where the Los Angeles Maritime Museum now stands 
and where Olesen now volunteers as harbor historian. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother and I came to join my father who was a lumber ship port captain 
here," said the former shipbuilder and commercial fisherman, whose home on 
Barton Hill was purchased by his Danish-born parents in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pedro in those days was a quaint place largely populated by seafaring 
immigrants, and I was fascinated with the dockside activity," Olesen said. 
</P>
<P>
The fascination with San Pedro (called simply "Pee-dro" by longtime residents) 
holds true as well for newcomers to the seaside community where wood-framed 
bungalows and small Spanish and English Tudor homes nestle on the slopes of the 
Palos Verdes hills at the southernmost tip of the peninsula, caressed by a 
nearly constant on-shore breeze. 
</P>
<P>
Named for St. Peter, the bishop of Alexandria in the 2nd Century, San Pedro is 
the end of the Harbor Freeway and about 25 miles from downtown Los Angeles -- a 
distance that provides welcome isolation from the urban center for an estimated 
76,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
Karen Lemons, an advertising executive who made a career move from Kansas in 
1985, settled in San Pedro because it was where she could afford to buy. She 
owns a condo unit in the Vista del Oro area but is now looking for a small, 
older home as a way of trading up. 
</P>
<P>
Lemons may have to pay between $250,000 and $400,000 for a house, depending on 
location. "I've put my condo on the market, but it's been slow to sell because 
the condo market in San Pedro is currently oversupplied," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her reason for buying another property in San Pedro has now less to do with 
affordability and more to do with living in a pleasant environment with its own 
individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"San Pedro is a melting pot where you find all kinds of ethnic cultures," she 
said. "I like the mixture of architectural styles that you find here and the 
fact that the community is built on a hillside and has more view property than 
any other beach city in the South Bay area." 
</P>
<P>
The area's history is rich with accounts that date back to 1542 when explorer 
Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo first entered its bay, and with romantic tales of 
mission settlers in the 1700s, of pirates and smugglers who used San Pedro Bay 
for illicit trade, and later of catalysts like Phineas Banning, who sparked 
early development of the present harbor. 
</P>
<P>
San Pedro, which enjoys the lowest crime rate of any community in the city of 
Los Angeles, was incorporated in 1888, but its residents voted for annexation 
to Los Angeles in 1909 to facilitate management of the port. Shortly after the 
construction of Angel's Gate breakwater in 1912, military protection was added 
with the establishment of Ft. MacArthur. 
</P>
<P>
Shipbuilding and canning -- traditional local industries that played a major 
role at the turn of the century and through the 1930s -- have declined over the 
past two decades. At San Pedro's recent Fisherman's Fiesta, it was apparent 
that its commercial fishing fleet had also dwindled dramatically -- from 300 to 
30 boats. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, the waterfront remains the domain of real-life fishermen who daily 
tend their nets after a night at sea, filling the air with the pungent odor of 
freshly caught fish. 
</P>
<P>
At Cabrillo Beach Marina -- the new focus of the community -- idle pleasure 
crafts await their weekend sailors, and beyond, cruise ships signal their 
tugboat escorts for entry to Worldport L.A., one of the world's busiest 
harbors. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Bradarich, the 39-year-old president of the San Pedro Board of Realtors and 
owner of RE/MAX Seapoint, grew up in San Pedro during the 1950s and '60s. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bit different then," he recalled. "It seemed as if every other person 
in town was either an uncle or a cousin. The most fun was when my granddad took 
us kids sardine fishing. He was a commercial fisherman from Yugoslavia who 
settled here in the early 1900s." 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavs and Italians, fishing families most of them, have been close-knit and 
have intermarried, Bradarich said. They still form the bulk of San Pedro's 
population mix. 
</P>
<P>
"I'M YUGO," seen on the license plate of a passing car attests to a competitive 
pride among groups that make up the ethnic diversity in the community -- 
Yugoslavs, Italians, Serbo-Croatians, Portuguese, Scandinavians, Russians, 
Greeks, Britons and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
The small homes built by early settlers on the hillside folds above San Pedro 
Bay provide the primary source of housing. 
</P>
<P>
Frank (Ray) Falk of Anchor Realty, who's been selling homes in the area for 
almost 27 years, has seen housing prices soar in San Pedro. But he adds that if 
one compares them with prices for comparable properties in nearby seaside 
communities, San Pedro's homes are still affordable. 
</P>
<P>
"One can still find a small home for $180,000 or $190,000, on the northeast 
corner of town, even though in some areas, it's gotten a bit ridiculous. But I 
believe prices will flatten out," Falk said. 
</P>
<P>
Real estate sales figures for the past 12 months show about a 15% decrease in 
property prices. 
</P>
<P>
Another trend seen during the past seven years, has been an onslaught of 
condominium construction of three- to 300-unit projects. The reason is that too 
many developers rushed in to build apartment projects just before a moratorium 
went into effect last year to curb the indiscriminate tearing down of older 
homes and landmark buildings. 
</P>
<P>
Rentals in San Pedro range from $750 to $1,200 for two-bedroom condominiums and 
$800 to $1,500 for two-bedroom homes. 
</P>
<P>
Marci Petrich, a first-time home buyer as a single parent, recently purchased a 
two-bedroom condominium in an area adjoining Rancho Palos Verdes, where units 
in her building are priced from $200,000 to $250,000. High-end prices are 
usually for hillside properties with views. 
</P>
<P>
"My roots are here, so I can appreciate how the housing picture in San Pedro 
has changed," she said. "In 1974, while I was still married, my husband and I 
bought a three-bedroom home in the Vista del Oro area for $40,000. That same 
house is now worth six times as much." 
</P>
<P>
Florence and Bill Culpert built their home in San Pedro 40 years ago. "The cost 
of construction in 1950 was $8 a square foot." said Culpert, a former yacht 
broker. "Current building costs now run anywhere from $60 to more than $100 a 
square foot." 
</P>
<P>
The Culperts live in the Palisades, a neighborhood once surrounded by Army and 
Navy installations. Today, the only remaining military presence at Ft. 
MacArthur is the U.S. Air Force, Culpert said. 
</P>
<P>
"When Florence and I moved here, San Pedro was the pits. There were no stores 
or restaurants to speak of. People like us moved here because the land values 
were so low. San Pedro was never a fashionable place to live, but that too is 
changing," Culpert said. 
</P>
<P>
The Palisades, Point Fermin, Southshore and Vista del Oro today are considered 
the preferred neighborhoods of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Other identifiable neighborhoods include Vinegar Hill, where an effort is under 
way to save post-Victorian homes built during the heyday of that district a 
century ago; Barton Hill, one of the earliest residential areas; the Latino 
barrio that has developed below Pacific Avenue, and a corridor commonly known 
as Shoestring Strip, that links San Pedro to the rest of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Largely untouched by the surge of coastal development in the '60s and '70s, San 
Pedro's older business district fell into decay in the 1950s, though in the 
past 10 years it has undergone a slow but continual revitalization. 
</P>
<P>
The increased interest by investors in San Pedro's potential for development 
has been a matter of concern to members of the San Pedro Bay Historical 
Society, who were moved to take inventory of the community's historical and 
cultural landmarks after entire blocks in the center of town had been leveled 
for redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
"We have so much history worth protecting," said Flora Baker, a past president 
of the group and well-known local historian. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to see picturesque or valuable old homes and buildings being 
replaced with blocks of condominiums. There has to be some care in where these 
projects are built so as not to overshadow the aura of Old San Pedro that is so 
precious to our heritage." 
</P>
<P>
Gary and Lynn Larson, owners of the San Pedro Bay Co., and Marylyn Ginsburg, a 
former art teacher turned real estate developer, have invested boldly in the 
renovation of several older structures. 
</P>
<P>
The 70-year-old Arcade Building on 6th Street, built by an Italian fishing 
broker and patterned after a "galleria" in Naples, has been painstakingly 
restored by the Larson family and is 100% leased by small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg's Grand House restaurant with its garden patio and adjacent 
bed-and-breakfast cottages on Grand Street is another creative example of 
adaptive reuse of one of the vintage residences. Both developers have been 
singled out for preservation awards by the Los Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Fran and Sam Botwin, 40-year residents of San Pedro, care a great deal about 
the quality of life in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been seeing some very positive signs everywhere," said Fran Botwin. "In 
my wildest dreams I never thought we'd see a high-rise in this town. But we 
have it now (the 11-story Pacific Place office tower), plus several new 
hotels," she added. 
</P>
<P>
A new Sheraton Hotel opened in the spring in the Beacon Street area, once the 
rough haunt of sailors on leave that now also houses the World Cruise Center, 
second only to Miami in passenger ship traffic. 
</P>
<P>
Waterfront attractions are numerous. Ports O'Call Village brings in more than 1 
million visitors a year and the new Compri Hotel in the marina will soon be 
joined by a 250-room Doubletree Hotel when Phase 2 of Cabrillo Beach Marina is 
completed. The expansion, currently under development will add another 2,000 
boat slips and three new major restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Botwin, who is honorary mayor of San Pedro and one of the organizers of the 
San Pedro Peninsula Homeowners' Coalition, singled out traffic congestion as 
the No. 1 problem for the town: 
</P>
<P>
"We have an increasing number of the people on the Hill (Palos Verdes 
Peninsula) who come down through the southern part of town into Western Avenue 
to get on to the Harbor Freeway. But with some cooperation, we should be able 
to alleviate that problem."

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: CLOSING COSTS SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED TO DETERMINE ADJUSTED 
SALE PRICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: We recently sold our home. In addition to the realtor's sales 
commission of 6% of the sales price, we had to pay a transfer tax, prorated 
property taxes, title insurance fee, attorney fee and several little fees for 
recording and documentation. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent article you said closing costs average about 2% of the sales price. 
But ours were much higher. When we calculate our net sales price, can we 
subtract all these costs from our gross sales price? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Home sellers' closing costs, excluding the sales commission, usually 
average about 2% of the gross sales price. But I hasten to add that closing 
costs are negotiable with the buyer and often can be shifted to the buyer if 
the seller needs more cash from the sale. 
</P>
<P>
In some states the transfer costs are very high. But in most states they will 
be about 2%. Of course, these expenses vary widely depending on what charges 
the seller has agreed to pay. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the prorated property taxes, which qualify as an itemized personal 
income-tax deduction, the closing costs you listed and paid should be 
subtracted from your home's gross sales price to arrive at the net or adjusted 
sales price. 
</P>
<P>
From this amount you subtract your adjusted cost basis, usually the purchase 
price, plus capital improvements added during home ownership, to arrive at your 
sale profit. 
</P>
<P>
If, within 24 months before or after the sale, you buy a replacement principal 
residence of equal or greater cost than your adjusted sales price, then you can 
defer tax on your sale profit. Ask your tax adviser to explain further. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Can Tax Depreciation Wait Till Next Year? 
</P>
<P>
Q: On my 1989 income tax returns I showed a loss of about $38,000 for a 
commercial building I own. Most of this was a paper loss for the depreciation 
deduction. Since I could only deduct the maximum $25,000 annual passive loss 
and have to waste the $13,000 balance, on my 1990 income tax returns can I 
reduce my depreciation deduction to save it for future tax years? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, but Uncle Sam does not allow you to adjust your depreciation 
deduction each year according to whether or not you can benefit from it on your 
income tax return. Once you begin depreciating your commercial property over 
31.5 years on a straight-line basis, you are locked into that depreciation 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
However, you can save up any unused tax losses above your $25,000 annual limit 
and use those losses to offset profits when you eventually sell your property. 
Please consult your tax adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A 10-Year Balloon Payment Is Safe 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are considering buying a home where we can assume the existing first 
mortgage and the seller will carry back a large second mortgage. However, she 
insists the second mortgage have a balloon payment due in 10 years. Do you 
think this is dangerous? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. A 10-year balloon payment is perfectly safe. By then you will probably 
either have enough equity in the house to refinance the first mortgage or 
perhaps you will have sold the home by then. Incidentally, if you think you 
might sell the home within 10 years it would be a good idea to make that second 
mortgage assumable, thereby increasing the salability of the home. 
</P>
<P>
For the second mortgage to be assumable, make sure it doesn't contain a 
due-on-sale clause. For further details, please consult your attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Title Lawsuit Clears Up Who Owns the House 
</P>
<P>
Q: We are in the process of trying to buy a house. If it wasn't such a bargain, 
we wouldn't put up with the impossible seller and the equally difficult real 
estate agent. The trouble is the seller, a widow, doesn't seem to have clear 
title. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, she apparently deeded a partial interest in the house to a man who 
loaned her some money. Instead of taking a mortgage, he got a 25% interest in 
the house. She claims he was paid back many years ago. But his name is still on 
the title and he can't be located. Any ideas? 
</P>
<P>
A: I am surprised the title insurance company has not suggested the widow, 
through a real estate attorney, bring a quiet title lawsuit. Such an action 
will determine if the absent co-owner has any ownership interest in the 
property. In the meantime, perhaps you can work out a rental arrangement with 
the seller so you can occupy the house with the rent applying toward the 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
A Run-Down House Sells Far Below Market 
</P>
<P>
Q: I have been an absentee landlord for the last 9 years. A neighbor was 
supposed to be looking after my house for me and selecting good tenants, but 
she didn't do a good job and the last tenants trashed the place. Since I live 
about 400 miles away, I have decided to sell. Do you think I should fix up the 
house, at a cost of about $5,000, or sell it in its present badly run-down 
condition? 
</P>
<P>
A: Fix it up. A run-down house appeals to few prospective home buyers, mostly 
bargain-hunters like me who expect a purchase price far below the market value 
of a house in good condition. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Negotiate Deed Terms in Lieu of Foreclosure 
</P>
<P>
Q: Due to illness and unemployment we are unable to make the payments on our 
condo. The mortgage balance is about what the condo is worth. We have tried to 
sell it, but the complex is badly built so nobody will buy. Our lender has 
offered to take a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Is there anything we should be 
wary about? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. Before you give the lender a deed in lieu of foreclosure be sure the 
lender gives you a written release of liability and a promise not to report the 
problem to the credit bureaus. Since you have paid the mortgage in full by 
deeding the property to the lender, you are entitled to such consideration. By 
signing the deed to the lender you are saving the lender thousands of dollars 
in costs. In return, the lender owes you some favors, too. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Profit on Second-Home Sale Fully Taxable 
</P>
<P>
Q: Last summer we sold our vacation home for a net profit of about $62,000. 
Since we plan to buy a winter ski condo in a few months, can we avoid the 
profit tax if we invest at least $62,000 in the condo? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. Your profit on the sale of your second home is fully taxable. There is 
no way to avoid the tax, as there is on the sale of your principal residence by 
purchasing a replacement primary home of equal or greater cost within 24 months 
before or after the sale (Internal Revenue Code 1034). Please consult your tax 
adviser for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Rather Than Making a Gift, Let Them Inherit 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am 78 and undecided what to do with my house when I move to a retirement 
home after Christmas. My late husband and I bought our home many years ago for 
only $10,000. Today it is worth over $200,000. My son and his family would like 
to move in when I move out. 
</P>
<P>
If I sell it to them I could use that "over 55 rule" $125,000 tax exemption you 
often discuss. But I really don't need the money and am thinking of giving the 
house to my son and his wife. However, I wonder if they might get a divorce, 
because they have only been married a few years and sometimes they don't get 
along too well. Do you think a gift of the house to them is a good idea? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. When real estate is given away, the donee takes over the donor's basis. 
Although I realize your $10,000 initial basis has probably increased due to 
capital improvements and a stepped-up basis increase when your husband died, 
your son and daughter-in-law will have a below-market basis if you give them 
the house now. This will raise their tax liability when they eventually sell 
the house. 
</P>
<P>
A better alternative is to let them inherit the house when you die. Then they 
will receive a new basis stepped up to market value on the date of your death. 
In the meantime, you can let them live in the house in return for paying the 
expenses. This choice also solves another possible problem in case they should 
get divorced before you die. For further details, please consult your tax 
adviser or attorney. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Tenant Improvements Revert to Landlord 
</P>
<P>
Q: About 3 years ago when a tenant moved into a rental house I own, he wanted 
me to upgrade the wall-to-wall carpets I was planning to install. He agreed to 
pay $700 toward the cost of the carpets. Now his lease expired and he will be 
moving out next month. He says the carpets belong to him and he is entitled to 
remove them since he paid part of their cost. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
A: No. The general rule is tenant improvements permanently attached to the 
structure become fixtures that belong to the landlord. In the absence of any 
agreement that the carpets belong to the tenant, they became your property when 
they were attached to the building. For further details please consult your 
attorney.

SMILES AMONG SLUMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hand-wringing and wailing in "Dealing With the Downturn" (Dec. 2), makes me 
smile. Finally, justice for the greedy. 
</P>
<P>
My spouse and I, in our early 30s, bring home about $50,000 a year before 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet we can't even dream about owning a home. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps we could qualify for a loan, but we have no money for even a 10% down 
payment. We don't have rich relatives who could give or even loan us that 
money. At our current level of savings ability, it would take us 15 years to 
build up enough for a down payment, and by then the currently exorbitant prices 
will only be worse. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of whining about our straits, I'd rather gloat over justice for the 
true villains in the "slump." Greedy homeowners, you're the ones twisting the 
knife into young adults like us, stuck throwing money away on rentals (which 
also are overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
Greedy real-estate agents -- you overdressed folks laughing all the way to the 
bank in your sun-roofed Mercedes with multiple cellulars. How obscene that 
you've been reaping tens of thousands of dollars per house for some paper work 
and phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the $300,000 home up the street crashed to half-price, my spouse and I 
couldn't afford it right now. Experts say even a 25% price drop would come only 
with economic catastrophe. But perhaps you homeowners, real estate agents and 
others who have profited from a commodity almost as fundamental as food will 
take a lesson from this. And reread the lines in the Times articles that 
mentioned crowds swarming to affordable properties. No shortage of buyers -- 
just of fair prices.

MEDIA DOOMSAYERS DO NOT HELP HOME SALES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's get positive! 
</P>
<P>
Having listed, sold and developed real estate in Southern California since 
1984, I have had the opportunity to see our industry expand dramatically and 
now, deflate on the unpredictable rails of media "doom and gloom." 
</P>
<P>
It has been purported that we are in a severe housing slump. But relative to 
what? 1980? 1973? 1988? 
</P>
<P>
The real estate industry, more than almost any other, is one whose survival is 
based on public perceptions -- not reality. If the public perceives a bad 
market, guess what? The market sours. If perceptions are that the market is 
"heating up," bingo! Sales improve. 
</P>
<P>
So what's to be done? How about some positive, upbeat reporting in those areas 
of real estate that are thriving rather than focusing on misery and mishap.

REMODELER'S DIARY: GETTING HOUSE IN SHAPE EARLY FOR RETIREMENT SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MONA LOCKE, Locke is an independent writer who lives in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
My husband and I were impelled into the wilderness of remodeling in the spring 
last year. The impetus was our 40-inch kitchen stove, which was about 30 years 
old. The stove was still doing its job, but it was beginning to show its age 
and couldn't bake a level cake. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's get a new one," said my husband, Wil. 
</P>
<P>
The stove was built into custom cabinets, so we tried to buy another just like 
it but couldn't find a 40-inch stove of any kind. We knew that some major 
cabinet remodeling would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Refitting the cabinets to accommodate a new stove would also mean rebuilding 
the ceramic countertops, and we knew we couldn't match the existing tile. 
</P>
<P>
With only one of our five children still at home, with college costs almost out 
of the way and retirement plans to be considered, we agreed that any 
improvements to the house should add to its resale value. 
</P>
<P>
Another important consideration was that we wanted to enjoy the fruits of our 
labor for awhile instead of making improvements and redecorating when we were 
ready to sell. 
</P>
<P>
So we made a list of things we wanted to do. In fact, we made several lists, 
juggling needed repairs against desired improvements until we settled on a 
combination we could afford: refinishing floors upstairs and down, getting new 
carpeting, windows, doors and entry tile, plus the final decorator items -- 
paint, wallpaper, draperies, bed covers, area rugs and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
We wanted to lighten and brighten our home in every way possible. And we wanted 
to build an all-new kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
We estimated costs, arranged the financing and then had to decide where to 
begin. We made mistake No. 1 when we started with the flooring. 
</P>
<P>
We knew the other projects -- remodeling the kitchen, replacing entry tile, 
redecorating -- should be done first, but we expected house guests through the 
summer and didn't want to offer them rooms. We made mistake No. 2 when we 
contracted for the floor refinishing and carpeting with a man sent out to 
measure our rooms by a vendor preparing an estimate. This man said he could 
save us quite a bit of money, and we accepted his offer. 
</P>
<P>
He said it would take two weeks to re-glue and refinish wood parquet floors in 
the master bedroom and hallway, install new wood parquet in the den, refinish 
the hardwood floor in the dining room and install carpeting in three upstairs 
bedrooms and a hallway. 
</P>
<P>
The day he was to start he called to say his truck had broken down. He began 
working two days later with a crew of young men who were neither careful nor 
experienced. 
</P>
<P>
They used the wrong stain on the wood parquet, which then had to be sanded and 
stained again, and installed a different shade of carpet than we ordered 
(though, ultimately, it proved to be better for our color scheme). 
</P>
<P>
The two-week schedule became a two-month nightmare, and we learned all over 
again that you get what you pay for. 
</P>
<P>
Before the flooring was finished, we had the putty replaced on all windows 
(instead of installing new ones). While that was going on, our first house 
guests arrived and, in the midst of a severe heat wave, we were awakened each 
morning at 7 to the sound of the glazers chipping out the old putty. 
</P>
<P>
Folding closet doors were replaced with sliding, mirrored doors in all bedrooms 
and a closet organizing system was installed in the master bedroom -- all 
without mishap or delay. 
</P>
<P>
We shopped for other items, including a garden window for the kitchen. While 
ordering the window, we struck gold. The salesperson we worked with asked if 
we'd thought about consulting a kitchen designer. She highly recommended a 
woman with whom she had studied. Sandra restored our faith in people and our 
own good judgment. She met with us, asked many questions, followed up with 
letters and phone calls, and when we decided to contract with her for 
professional plans, she went into high gear. 
</P>
<P>
She advised us on how to verify the licenses of all contractors and 
subcontractors; how to prepare for interim cooking and dining facilities; which 
contractors and subcontractors to schedule, in which order. 
</P>
<P>
She counseled us on the latest lighting options and provided information on 
where to shop for good buys in fixtures, lighting and flooring. 
</P>
<P>
She also gave us great advice on the new kitchen sink: "Find a model you like 
with drains at the back, not in the middle. That way, your garbage disposal and 
plumbing connections will be at the back and you'll have a lot more usable 
space under the sink." 
</P>
<P>
When we ordered the cabinets at the end of October, we had to decide whether to 
begin construction as soon as the cabinets were delivered or wait until after 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
The subcontractors said they could do the job in two or three weeks -- four at 
the most. Our designer said we'd be lucky to be back in the kitchen in less 
than six to eight weeks. We listened to her. It's a good thing we did, because 
demolition began on Jan. 9 this year, and we couldn't cook (let alone eat) in 
the kitchen again until Feb. 20 -- six weeks to the day. 
</P>
<P>
One subcontractor caused the delay. In dealing with him, we made Mistake No. 3 
-- which was to pay him for work not yet done. We learned that we must never do 
that for any reason. A reputable, responsible contractor or subcontractor has 
established credit with suppliers and enough capital reserve to expect payment 
only when the work has been done in an acceptable manner. 
</P>
<P>
While the final work was being done on the kitchen, we began scheduling the 
last of the remodeling and decorating, including some additional electrical 
work, exterior and interior doors, entry tile, ceiling fans in the bedrooms, 
wallpapering, and painting. 
</P>
<P>
Each time one of these projects was delayed (and most of them were), it meant 
rescheduling the workmen who were to follow. 
</P>
<P>
But the work was finally finished nine months after it began, and the results 
have made every minute of frustration and difficulty worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Our home has the bright, cheerful appearance we envisioned. The new kitchen is 
much more efficient and comfortable, with all-adjustable shelving, all base 
cabinets equipped with pull-out shelves or drawers, and a cabinet finish that 
is easily cleaned with cool water and a dry cloth. 
</P>
<P>
The entry is brighter and more welcoming, bedrooms appear larger and are easily 
cooled after a hot day, and the slightly imperfect flooring is easily 
maintained. 
</P>
<P>
We can enjoy the results of this odyssey until we're ready to retire and sell. 
Then, whether we build our retirement home or buy one that needs remodeling, 
the first person we'll contact is Sandra.

PREPARE THE WALL SURFACE BEFORE HANGING WALLPAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE FARROW, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Something you can't even see has a major effect on the appearance of your new 
wallpaper. Proper surface preparation of the wall itself, before the paper is 
installed, helps ensure that your expensive new paper will adhere smoothly to 
the wall for years. 
</P>
<P>
When wallpaper appears to have lumps, bumps or seems to be coming away from the 
wall near the ceiling or floor, it is generally because it has been applied to 
an uneven surface. 
</P>
<P>
Though it may necessitate renting a wallpaper steamer, experts recommend that 
all the old wallpaper be removed. This can be a bit of a project, particularly 
if the wallpaper has been painted over. There are also chemical solvents on the 
market; these work by dissolving the paste holding up the old wallpaper. 
</P>
<P>
After the old layers of wallpaper have been removed, try to make the wall as 
smooth as if it were to be painted. Fill in holes and cracks with spackling 
compound, and lightly sand the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Paint the wall with an oil-based primer because the primer in effect seals the 
wall by reducing its capacity to absorb moisture from the wallpaper paste. 
</P>
<P>
Though these tasks are time-consuming, they require more care than skill and 
will protect your wallpaper investment. A useful guide, with more information 
about preparing the walls, is "Painting and Wallpapering" (Ortho Books, $6.95). 
It is available in book and hardware stores.

CHRISTMAS: I WON'T BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS

For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery 
gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As 
soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement 
may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here, 
current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable 
Christmases away from home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
VIETNAM, 1967 
</P>
<P>
I planned to spend my third Christmas in Vietnam with American troops near the 
Demilitarized Zone, expecting simply to share their C rations and stoicism. 
</P>
<P>
On this reporting trip I wasn't looking for much in the way of holiday spirit: 
Grunts weren't given to much sentiment in that very dangerous part of the 
world. And the place I landed didn't appear to offer much. It had no name, just 
a forward outpost called C-1, in the sandy terrain north of Leatherneck Square 
-- hard by the minefields and foxholes of the DMZ. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Con Thien -- the corner of Leatherneck Square and target for shells 
from North Vietnam -- I heard that an overnight cease-fire might be honored, 
and that South Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Cao Ky would pay a visit. 
</P>
<P>
The Marines, however, were skeptical. Sgt. Stephen Newcomb told me he was 
planning to stay inside his bunker, ready to fire back if necessary. On his 
sandbags was the sign: "Noel." 
</P>
<P>
At C-1, as the tropic sun swiftly fell behind the jagged Annamite Range, stars 
blossomed in a cool, black sky. In the unaccustomed quiet, I could hear faint 
sounds of surf from the South China Sea. 
</P>
<P>
It was one of those moments when you realized just how lovely that battered and 
forlorn country really was. 
</P>
<P>
During the evening, Marshal Ky choppered in. He was joined by Vietnamese troops 
and a busload of choir girls, in flowing ao dais, from the city of Hue. The 
grunts had already downed their C's, but Ky's aides brought in beer and Scotch 
to go with a Vietnamese banquet -- and invited everyone to dinner after Mass. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, soldiers had decorated surrounding barbed wire with colored bunting 
and affixed paper stars to the tops of sandbagged bunkers. The mood at C-1 had 
shifted from anxiety to gaiety. 
</P>
<P>
Just before midnight, the strains of "Silent Night" issued from a tape 
recorder, and a Vietnamese chaplain celebrated midnight Mass -- the responses 
coming from the choir. 
</P>
<P>
About 80 Vietnamese and 20 American soldiers knelt before the chaplain, Capt. 
Nguyen Van Trinh, to receive Communion. 
</P>
<P>
I've subsequently been to Midnight Mass at St. Peter's, but this was more 
affecting: the mood warm and intimate, the lively scene illuminated by orange 
flares launched by Marines in Dong Ha to the south, the cease-fire holding. 
</P>
<P>
After Mass, a 23-year-old soldier-communicant named Robert Drewek -- with that 
mixture of reverence and saltiness common to GIs -- told me: "This Mass sure as 
hell made my Christmas. It was something special -- to think they could do it 
way out here, near No Man's Land." 
</P>
<P>
As the post-Mass celebration began and GIs broke into a chorus of "Jingle 
Bells," Father Trinh looked reflectively around and said to me: "This is the 
way it should be in my country. No guns. No shooting. No war." 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, it would be a long time before the padre got his Christmas wish. WILLIAM 
TUOHY, Tuohy covered the war in Vietnam from 1965 through 1968, and won the 
Pulitzer Prize for his work there in 1968. After serving as Times Saigon bureau

THE SAVVY TRAVELER: ENVELOPES, PLEASE: SOME TRAVEL AWARDS FOR 1990 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER S. GREENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To say that it has been a traumatic, tumultuous year in travel would surely be 
an understatement, what with rising airline ticket prices due to fuel costs and 
bankruptcies, plus cruise line mergers and numerous hotels flirting with 
Chapter 11. 
</P>
<P>
For many of us, the art of travel has often been transformed into an endurance 
contest. Getting there is no longer even half the fun. 
</P>
<P>
But 1990 was not without its unsung heroes of travel -- hotels, airlines and 
people who went above and beyond to remind us that the act of travel can still 
be an art. Here, a few who deserve a few kudos: 
</P>
<P>
Airline Service Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Diane Rothberg, first officer, Air Canada. As Rothberg was leaving the 
Toronto airport after completing a flight, she noticed a panicked passenger 
running into the terminal. It was clearly not this man's day. He had been stuck 
in traffic, then his car had a flat tire right in front of the terminal. He was 
on the verge of missing his flight, and was pleading at the counter with an Air 
Canada ticket agent to help him. Rothberg raced over to the passenger and 
jotted down his name and address. She took his car keys and told him to catch 
his flight. And what did Rothberg do? She rolled up her sleeves, changed the 
tire, parked the passenger's car and arranged for him to pick up his keys. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Phil Winsor, supervisor, Midway Airlines, Washington, D.C. Winsor learned 
that a passenger aboard Flight 164 from Chicago had not checked his bags in 
time to make his flight. On top of that, the passenger was scheduled to make an 
important presentation the next morning at 8 a.m. There was no way his bags 
would catch up with him in time. When the passenger landed at 10 p.m., Winsor 
met him and found out his shirt size and where he was staying. On his own, 
Winsor found a new white shirt and silk tie and had it delivered at 6:30 a.m. 
the next morning to the passenger's hotel, compliments of Midway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lydia Ortiz, American Airlines. There are those who are convinced that 
American Airlines special services rep Lydia Ortiz never sleeps. Ortiz, based 
in Puerto Rico, is always at the airport, running between terminals, counters 
and gates. She is American's Ms. Fix-it, Puerto Rico's problem solver. And, 
with San Juan serving as a major Caribbean hub, there are plenty of passenger 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Richard Branson, owner, Virgin Atlantic Airways. Starting in September, 
Branson organized 10 special relief flights to the Persian Gulf area. Each 
time, he flew in supplies -- more than 450 tons of food and medicine. And each 
time, he flew out with returning hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 -- MGM Grand Air. Last week, the Los Angeles-based luxury airline converted 
one of its DC-8s into a cargo plane loaded with everything from 20,000 Mrs. 
Fields cookies to Kodak cameras -- holiday gifts to be given to U.S. troops 
stationed in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Penny Carter, flight attendant, American Airlines. On every flight, Carter 
carries with her an additional bag. Inside is her special bathroom kit. She 
outfits the tiny lavatory closest to her station with a fabric toilet-top 
cover, reading material, flowers, air freshener, a small collection of 
seashells, pencils, toothbrushes and toothpaste, doily-wrapped soap dishes and 
a sense of humor -- there's even a two-inch globe on a stand "to help you 
navigate while you're in there." It goes without saying that most airline 
lavatories are a disgrace. It also goes without saying that Carter has 
recognized this problem and single-handedly tried to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
And speaking of bathrooms, an honorable mention goes to John Munro, vice 
president of Greyhound. Munro has been dropping into bus stations across North 
America and insisting on lunch with the managers of those terminals . . . in 
their restrooms. It's a bizarre idea, but Munro has gotten the message across 
to bus terminal managers to clean up their act. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel Service Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To The Mark, in New York City. It's one thing to get easily seduced by a 
hotel when it first opens. After all, the incentive is there for managers as 
well as employees to attract business. It's another thing to look at the same 
hotel a year later to see if it has lost any of its shine. The answer in The 
Mark's case: It hasn't. About the only thing that has happened in the last year 
is that positive word-of-mouth among hotel guests has made getting a room there 
much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stouffer hotels. In 1989, the company announced that it would begin 
eliminating those nickel-and-dime "extra charges" -- everything from charging 
guests for receiving faxes to dialing toll-free calls. Stouffer not only did 
it, they've maintained the program. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sylvia Gabe and the staff of the Sheraton Crossroads Hotel in Mahwah, N.J. 
Gabe was scheduled to get married at the hotel in April. She had already put 
down a substantial deposit for her reception at the Sheraton. But at the last 
minute, the husband-to-be jilted her. So what did Gabe do? Together with the 
staff of the hotel, she threw a party for 50 abused and emotionally disturbed 
children. 
</P>
<P>
Domestic Airline Food Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Alaska Airlines. Most of the time airline food is an oxymoron. Not on 
Alaska. If you've flown the airline, you know what I'm talking about. If you 
haven't, you should. 
</P>
<P>
International Airline Food Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa (tie). Both airlines have mastered the 
art of understanding what food works -- and what doesn't -- at 35,000 feet. And 
a special nod of appreciation to Lufthansa for realizing that on short flights 
within Europe, a good sandwich and a piece of fresh fruit is precisely what 
should be served. 
</P>
<P>
Most Improved Airline Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Northwest. Traditionally, Northwest looked at passenger service as an 
afterthought. New ownership and a new philosophy has boosted company morale 
and, in turn, passenger satisfaction. Even the food is improved. 
</P>
<P>
Best Airline to Europe Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Virgin Atlantic. For the second year in a row, this airline continues to 
do a great job. Disembarking passengers have actually been known to have smiles 
on their faces. And while Virgin's business-class service is terrific, most of 
the kudos go to the airline's coach service. 
</P>
<P>
Best Airline to Asia Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To Cathay Pacific. Its new nonstop service between Los Angeles and Hong 
Kong makes a 15-hour journey manageable. The Compassionate Travel Award: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To American Airlines and its Miles for Kids program. Members of American's 
frequent-flier advantage program are encouraged to donate a portion of their 
accumulated mileage, in increments of 10,000 miles, to help many worthwhile 
organizations provide transport for children with special needs.

THE TASTE OF TRAVEL: FINDING LOCAL SPECIALS IN MUNICH MAKES CENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL LASLEY and ELIZABETH HARRYMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
MUNICH, Germany 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Earlier this month in Munich, vendors were setting up wooden booths for 
Cristkindlmarkt, the Christmas market in the town square Marienplatz. 
Shopkeepers were draping boughs of fir and spruce over doorways. Restaurant 
owners were offering such seasonal specialties as Christmas stollen and roast 
goose. 
</P>
<P>
And we were searching for affordable food. For this endeavor we had asked 
Christie Aswell, an American living in Germany, to act as our guide. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the bells of St. Peter's Church have chimed noon, you're not supposed to 
eat weisswurste," Aswell said as we strolled the winding streets of Munich. 
"Nobody knows how the custom started, but if you order them after noon, you'll 
get rude stares." 
</P>
<P>
Not wanting to flaunt tradition, Aswell, whose husband is in the U.S. Army in 
Germany, took us to the restaurant Weisses Brauhaus for an 11:30 a.m. sausage 
lunch. 
</P>
<P>
Like many military families stationed in Europe, Aswell and her husband have 
become proficient at stretching today's anemic dollar in an increasingly 
expensive Germany, so she helped us find affordable restaurants that serve 
local specialties. 
</P>
<P>
At Weisses Brauhaus, we nibbled crusty rolls and large pretzels from a communal 
basket on the table and ordered weisswurste, fat veal sausage seasoned with 
lemon and parsley. 
</P>
<P>
There is even a traditional way to eat weisswurste. After cutting the sausage 
in half, you pick up a piece and dip it into some sweet mustard (there are pots 
of it on each table), then you suck the meat out of the casing. The activity 
itself is fun and the sweet mustard is delicious with the mild, white sausage. 
</P>
<P>
Totaling the bill, the waitress asked how many rolls and pretzels we'd eaten. 
They were 35 cents each. A serving of two sausages was about $4.50. Tips are 
included in restaurant bills, but locals often leave an additional 5% if 
service is good. 
</P>
<P>
Weisswurste is just one of the specialties we savored in a city that offers 
everything from traditional Bavarian pork sausage to Belon oysters from 
Brittany. Fancy food markets such as the well-established Alois Dallmayr and 
the newer, trendier Kafer cater to local food lovers, while the 
Viktualienmarkt, an open-air market in the center of town, offers an abundance 
of fresh fruit and vegetables year-round. 
</P>
<P>
"Goose is served everywhere at Christmas," Aswell said as we sat down to dinner 
at Durnbrau, a typical Bavarian restaurant in the center of Munich. Deer 
antlers hung on the walls and holiday decorations dangled from the ceiling. 
Although it was early in the evening, the restaurant, which dates to 1487, was 
already crowded. 
</P>
<P>
We tried the roast goose marinated in vinegar and red wine (about $16). It had 
a wonderful, sweet-sour taste. The skin was crisp, the meat tender. Red cabbage 
cooked with apples was pleasantly tart, and bread dumplings the size of tennis 
balls were perfect for sopping up the rich brown gravy from the wooden serving 
bowl. 
</P>
<P>
For dessert, we split an order of kaiserschmarn (about $9). The thick pancake, 
which was massive enough for eight, contained almonds and raisins and was baked 
until a crust of caramelized sugar formed on the bottom. We dipped the warm, 
powdered-sugar-sprinkled pieces into applesauce and wished we had begun with 
dessert. 
</P>
<P>
German pastries are habit-forming, and we adopted the local custom of stopping 
in small cafes for an afternoon snack. Kreutzkamm Conditorei is famous for its 
Christmas stollen, a traditional holiday yeast cake crammed with raisins, 
currants, citron and almonds and drenched in powdered sugar. 
</P>
<P>
We also tried baumkuchen, a butter cake made by pouring layers of batter over a 
pole that revolves in front of a fire. 
</P>
<P>
While Kreutzkamm is a traditional, Old World-style bakery/cafe, Gourmet Morth 
is contemporary. There we tried a mango mousse tart, fragrant with fresh mango 
and, miraculously in December, a wild strawberry tart. These cafes can also be 
affordable spots for a light lunch. You can have a bowl of soup for about 
$3.50, sandwiches for about $5 and pastries for about $3. 
</P>
<P>
Or try Nurnberger schweinwurst, tiny pork sausages the size of a finger. They 
originated in Nuremberg but are a passion in Munich. A good place to sample 
them is Nurnberger Bratwurstglockl, a cozy restaurant near Marienplatz. We sat 
at a corner table beneath leaded glass windows and ordered leberspatzl soup 
(about $2.95). Out came a bowl of clear consomme with liver dumplings and 
chives. The savory broth was warming on a damp December morning, and the 
dumplings tasted strongly of liver. 
</P>
<P>
In the back of the small, crowded room, we could see through a glass door into 
the kitchen where a woman was roasting bratwurst scented with garlic and herbs 
over an open flame. The bratwurst was sensational with sauerkraut and sharp 
mustard. 
</P>
<P>
The same type of sausage was boiled and served with carrots, celery and onions. 
The aroma of the vegetables permeated the sausages with a delectable 
combination of flavors that was very different from the grilled version. The 
grilled sausages were about $4 for four; boiled they were about $7 for six. 
</P>
<P>
Munich has its share of fancy restaurants, but the current exchange rate makes 
them incredibly expensive. "At the best restaurants, it will cost you $300 to 
$400 for a meal for two people without wine," Aswell said. 
</P>
<P>
As an alternative, she suggested Mark's, which opened this spring in the Hotel 
Rafael. So on our last night in Munich, we climbed a circular staircase from 
the hotel lobby to find a spacious room with candles and orchids on every 
table. 
</P>
<P>
We began with a terrine of goose liver layered with sliced truffle and 
lingonberries. It was fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
Although a native of Munich, chef Frank Heppner cooked for years in the Orient, 
and that influence was seen in a dish of prawns and noodles. For it, a sauce of 
ginger and lemon grass topped with finely chopped red bell peppers, chives and 
ginger was served over very thin noodles something like angel hair pasta. 
</P>
<P>
Veal fillets were served with intensely flavored, slightly sweet port wine 
sauces -- one white, one red, with grilled Belgian endive on the side. For 
dessert there were deep-fried Asian spring rolls filled with fresh fruit glazed 
with honey and served on a fresh coconut sauce. It was a light dessert with 
just enough sweetness to satisfy. 
</P>
<P>
The restaurant was quiet with lots of space between tables and perfect service. 
It's the kind of place you wish for at home. At $150 for two, the dinner was 
expensive, but it was one of those meals we will savor for years. 
</P>

France: Alan Samuels of Palm Desert writes: "Misplaced the clip on a village 
you wrote about with a town crier in the Alsace region of France." 
</P>
<P>
The village is Turckheim, near the city of Colmar on the Route du Vin. Features 
France's only remaining town crier. Appears nightly, leading visitors by 
lantern light through the cobbled alleyways of Turckheim. You enter Turckheim 
through 800-year-old gates. Shops, restaurants, a museum. Try for a room at the 
Hotel des Deux Clefs. A medieval setting with timbered walls, leaded windows. 
Public rooms feature classical melodies. This is a former coaching stop. In 
winter, guests dine by a fire in the lounge. Meals in summer are served in the 
garden. The town crier emerges precisely at 9 each evening from a guard house 
near the entrance to Turckheim. Crowds join him in his march through the 
village. 
</P>
<P>
For brochures, write to the French Government Tourist Office, 9454 Wilshire 
Blvd., Suite 3030, Beverly Hills 90212, or call (900) 420-2003 (50 cents per 
minute). 
</P>
<P>
River Cruises: In these recessionary times, travel bargains remain. America's 
former Cold War adversary, the Soviet Union, will be offering seven-night 
cruises on the Volga River in '91 for only $499 per passenger. Trips will be 
between Moscow and Kazan, with visits to five ports. Dneiper River cruises are 
even cheaper ($399) aboard the MS Glushkov, one of the flagships of the Soviet 
River Fleet. Outside cabins, picture windows. Excursions by private motor coach 
at each port of call. English-speaking guides. These cruises can be tied in 
with post-cruise visits to Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Your travel agent or Rivers of Russia, 1601 Industrial Way, Suite 195, Belmont, 
Calif. 94002, (800) 552-3032. 
</P>
<P>
New York Taxis: We still get complaints occasionally from disgruntled travelers 
who are unhappy with New York taxi drivers. Particularly cabbies serving JFK. 
If you feel you've been taken out of your way, report the driver by calling 
(212) 221-TAXI. Note the medallion number on the cab's roof, on the outside 
passenger door or dashboard. At the same time, jot down the driver's number 
(also displayed on the dash). 
</P>
<P>
Here are some sample fares from JFK into Manhattan: $30/$35 to Upper Manhattan, 
$25/$30 to Lower Manhattan, $28/$30 to the Bronx, $18/$21 to Brooklyn, $16/$18 
to Queens. Tolls are extra and tipping, while optional, is expected. Be sure to 
ask for a receipt that contains the cab's medallion number. Remember also that 
meters automatically read $1.50 at the start of the trip from JFK. In addition, 
a 50-cent toll charge is added between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. The starter who calls 
your cab at the JFK terminal will hand you a yellow slip. Keep it in case of 
problems.

CHRISTMAS: I WON'T BE HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS

For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery 
gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As 
soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement 
may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here, 
current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable 
Christmases away from home.

LONDON, 1974 
</P>
<P>
When I needed a good quote in my days as a London correspondent, I always 
turned to Mr. Herbert, the friendly wine merchant who spoke in word bites for 
newspapermen. What did Londoners think of their economy? What does bad weather 
do to the English soul? Ask Herbert. 
</P>
<P>
One day he disappeared, off to Australia to live, he was. It seemed to be a 
plot to deprive an American reporter of his ration of pithy quotes. But, 
suddenly, six months later, he was back for good. And still in form. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in Australia," he said, "was like living in a brand-new railroad 
station where the train never comes." 
</P>
<P>
I think of the quote when I think of London during the holidays because that's 
like living in an old railroad station where the train never comes. London at 
this time of year gives a whole new meaning to the word boring. 
</P>
<P>
The city seems to close down for days on end. Where is everyone? Are they all 
in Mallorca? Are they hiding out and sharpening elbows to prepare for the 
annual Harrods sale? What's happening in the world? 
</P>
<P>
All this is an exaggeration, of course, but it doesn't seem to be if you live 
through it, and we lived through seven of these "festive" seasons in London, 
from 1967 to 1974. No tubes, buses or trains run on Christmas Day and no 
newspapers are published. 
</P>
<P>
The British Museum, and the Victoria and Albert, traditional great escapes, 
close down for four days. One of my favorite restaurants, the White Tower, puts 
away its wonderful Greek cuisine from Dec. 21 until after New Year's. The 
after-Christmas sales at the major stores do not begin Dec. 26, but the 27th, 
and the hectic, uncivil Harrods sale is not until Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
So what did we do? We watched the annual Christmas message from Queen Elizabeth 
II on televison and, for extra excitement, we watched it again. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, we looked at some of the other holiday fare on the BBC -- the habits 
of either the Slavonian Grebe or the elusive Tree Creeper and, if the kids were 
asleep, we clandestinely viewed a documentary on the future of rubbish in S.W. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps part of the problem was that we were never invited to the country with 
the posh, who spoke later of groaning boards and black ties during the season, 
a tradition the British noblesse stole from the Ahwahnee Hotel in Yosemite. 
</P>
<P>
We stayed behind and waited, waited for London to get back to its normal self. 
</P>
<P>
One thing we did while waiting for the city to revive was to plan summer 
holidays before all the reasonable "all-in" package trips were booked. For by 
Christmas Day, every home in the nation had a pile of just-published brochures 
from the British tour operators who knew that people, including expatriate 
Americans, were looking for something, anything, to read. 
</P>
<P>
So, we considered two days in Leningrad. The tulip season in the Netherlands 
had an appeal. And, we thought, one day in Mallorca would allow us to see 
whether any Londoners were left over from Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
On balance, there are worse places to be this time of year and there is 
certainly nothing wrong with the place the rest of the year. Sometimes, I 
wonder what Mr. Herbert would say about London's holiday wonderland. I'll ask 
him for a quote the next time I see him. ALVIN SHUSTER, Shuster, the Foreign 
Editor of The Times, lived overseas from 1967 until 1977 as the bureau chief

ISRAEL AND OCCUPIED WEST BANK, 1987 
</P>
<P>
Like Mary and Joseph, the last place my wife and I expected to spend Christmas 
was Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
We had just moved into a new house on the Mediterranean island of Cyprus in 
December. We were in the process of decorating a pine tree freshly chopped in 
the Troodos Mountains when the telephone call came informing me that 
demonstrations by Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West 
Bank were getting out of hand. I was to proceed at once to Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The Old City of Jerusalem has always held a special fascination for me, a 
powerful mixture of history and stark beauty. In the stone streets already worn 
smooth when King Richard the Lion-Hearted stood at the gates, it is still not 
unusual to hear the high-pitched call to prayer of the Muslim muezzin mingling 
with the toll of church bells as old as Christianity itself. 
</P>
<P>
But by December, the city had been transformed by the politics of the intifada, 
a word then rarely heard. Instead of the rhythmic tolling of bells, we heard 
the crash of plate-glass windows and the popping of army rifles. 
</P>
<P>
I drove through the West Bank, which travelers once called The Holy Land, and 
found the road to Bethlehem empty but for a few Israeli soldiers. There was a 
Christmas tree in Manger Square decked out in colored balls, but the shops were 
shuttered in a protest strike. Everyone on the streets kept looking nervously 
up at the sharpshooters placed strategically around the square, overlooking the 
Church of the Nativity, which tradition holds to be the spot where Jesus was 
born. "People don't feel up to celebrating Christmas in this atmosphere," said 
Bishara E. Awad, who runs the Bethlehem Bible College. 
</P>
<P>
With the sodium security floodlights, it was hard to imagine three wise men 
losing their way in the desert. As I walked down the narrow streets of the 
town, Israeli soldiers in brown uniforms brushed past, eyes flicking over the 
faces staring back out of the old stone houses. The entire economy of Bethlehem 
depends heavily on pilgrims coming for Christmas, and it was clear that no one 
was coming. Bethlehem's shops contain every imaginable form of the creche scene 
-- from illuminated lamps to ashtrays. But nobody was buying. 
</P>
<P>
Back in Jerusalem, a beard of tear gas hung over the Arab quarter. I managed a 
candlelit dinner and watched midnight Mass in Bethlehem on television. The 
camera kept panning to the front pew, where a policeman, obviously expecting 
trouble, was fingering his gun. Omar, our Muslim waiter, appeared with tears on 
his cheeks. "Isn't it awful?" he said. "Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Some 
Merry Christmas." CHARLES P. WALLACE, Wallace is The Times' bureau chief in

<P>
MOSCOW, 1984 
</P>
<P>
Christmas, 1984, was shaping up to be as gray and mirthless as the year 
novelist George Orwell immortalized in his tale of totalitarian society. 
</P>
<P>
It was bitter cold, and the usually quiet routine of those days before 
perestroika had been upset by the Dec. 20 death of Defense Minister Dmitri 
Ustinov, imposing 18-hour workdays on the few of us reporters left behind to 
hold down the fort in the dreary depths of winter. 
</P>
<P>
Then as now, the holiday season in Moscow begins only in the last days of 
December. Russian Orthodox Christmas falls in early January -- an event few 
dared to observe during the age of official atheism. Since the 1917 Bolshevik 
Revolution, gift-giving and merriment has been transferred to New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Scrawny yolochki -- New Year's trees -- appeared for sale only on Dec. 23, most 
of them damaged in transit and already losing their needles. 
</P>
<P>
My husband, Ken Olsen, and I were determined to cling to some traditions for 
our first-ever Christmas far away from home. We ducked into one of the icy 
yards dispensing flattened evergreens as soon as the first batch arrived. The 
trees were so thin we bought two and lashed them together with twine to have 
enough branches to hold our ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
We were wallowing in self-pity, remembering big family gatherings and watching 
wistfully as American friends headed home to the states. 
</P>
<P>
In a half-hearted effort to cheer ourselves up, we invited over the few 
correspondents left in Moscow and a handful of Russian refuseniks -- those 
denied permission to emigrate -- who were curious what an American Christmas 
was all about. 
</P>
<P>
I ordered a frozen turkey from an import firm in Helsinki, Finland, and a 
British friend who was returning to Moscow after covering Mikhail Gorbachev's 
trip to London was bringing in Christmas puddings and other Western treats. 
</P>
<P>
It was the sensation caused by Gorbachev's London visit, when he first appeared 
to be the Kremlin heir-apparent, and the absence of then-leader Konstantin 
Chernenko at Ustinov's funeral, that drew the eyes of the news world to Moscow 
on Christmas Eve. Reversing themselves, several American newspapers and 
magazines ordered their correspondents to stay in the Soviet Union, fearing 
Chernenko's absence heralded an impending change in the leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, it was our colleagues' disappointment at being assigned to a death 
watch that caused our Christmas spirit to finally kick in. Sympathizing with 
those who hadn't expected to spend Christmas separated from wives and children, 
we invited them to our celebration and scurried to whip up a bigger dinner and 
extra eggnog. 
</P>
<P>
The "Marooned in Moscow" party expanded as we also rang up complete strangers 
sent in to substitute for vacationing correspondents, knowing they would 
otherwise spend the holiday alone. Vodka flowed freely and there were childish 
gifts all around, including toy Red Army missile launchers complete with 
plastic projectiles we fired into posters of the ruling Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
When our friends and guests stayed until 5 a.m. to play silly charades and 
share Soviet jokes, we felt we had rescued something of the spirit of Christmas 
after all. CAROL J. WILLIAMS, Williams is chief of The Times' Budapest bureau.

For Travelers, there is inevitably a moment when the exhilaration of discovery 
gives way to an acute sense of being a stranger in a very foreign place. As 
soldiers, diplomats and foreign correspondents know, that sense of displacement 
may be keenest at times of traditional togetherness and homecoming. Here, 
current and former foreign correspondents share some of their most memorable 
Christmases away from home.

KENYA, 1980 
</P>
<P>
The train from Nairobi, high on the Kenyan plains, down to Mombasa on the 
coast, was slow and groaning and took all night. It was pulled by a team of 
diesel engines but wasn't much different, from the perspective of the dining 
car, than it appeared in the movie "Out of Africa." The waiters, sure-footed as 
spiders on a rocking leaf, served soup from dented silver-plate tureens. Soft 
lights gleamed off polished wooden walls, the cutlery jingled. It was Christmas 
at the coast, and the train was crowded. 
</P>
<P>
My wife and I had come with motorcycles, a pair of high-riding Hondas, loaded 
into a baggage car. Other travelers came with trunks and suitcases. A pair of 
shameless greenhorns, we brought packs, canvas bags and a tent, lashed to racks 
on the bikes. We would wander the coast and camp for Christmas on a beach. 
</P>
<P>
We awoke to the sudden swelter of the equatorial coast, off-loaded the 
motorcycles and set out southward, pitching our tent beneath palms in a place 
so remote we had to ride miles to find something cold to drink. After two days 
-- dirty, sunburned, raw with the bites of sand fleas and mosquitoes -- the 
idea of more formal accommodations took on the attraction of a mirage. But 
every hotel on the coast was full to overflowing. 
</P>
<P>
I had a new-found friend, a Scotsman who had lived 25 years in Kenya, who had 
invited me to drop in to visit at the modest resort where he and his family had 
been going for Christmas for years. We went, back through Mombasa, across the 
ferry at Kilifi, north toward Malindi, arriving weary and scorched. 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there were no places. The white-washed cabins were all occupied, but 
my friend interceded with the management, which consented to bend its 
no-camping rule. It was as though we had fallen into a huge family gathering. 
In fact, there were a score of families, all regulars who booked their cabins 
from Christmas to Christmas, a year in advance. For two days, they averted 
their eyes from our shameful tent, this flagrant breach of protocol, and then, 
owing to some early departure, a place was found for us. 
</P>
<P>
Slowly, we were taken in to a new world, a world of displaced Englishmen in 
Africa, and enveloped in the stories of their lives, recollections of the 
Mau-Mau uprising, memories of farms and lion hunters. 
</P>
<P>
Every afternoon at 4:30, after a nap through the heat of the afternoon, tea and 
scones, still warm from the oven, arrived on the cabin porch. For dinner every 
night, if desired, there was fresh lobster, and trifle pudding for desert. And 
for Christmas, Yorkshire pudding with the turkey and roast beef. And talk, into 
the night, on bent camphor-wood chairs set in the sand on the edge of the 
beach. They were discussions touched often with melancholy over the new order, 
the dwindling fortunes, the growing number of college-aged children, born in 
Kenya, opting now for British citizenship and leaving for England, voting with 
their feet on their future in Africa. It was an ending, they said, that had 
been a long time coming. But it had been a merry time while it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
That was the first of six years in Africa, and although we spent two 
Christmases in Europe, the Kenyan coast pulled us back most strongly. Our last 
one was far down the coast from our first, although not far from our original 
bivouac under the palms. Lucky at last, we found a beach cottage to rent for 
the holiday. Good friends joined us, along with my daughter, all the way from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
We, too, felt like veterans by then, tanned and weathered and nearing our own 
departure. We sat out under the stars, our chairs in a circle. We had our own 
stories to tell, and we told them and laughed a lot and surveyed the full moon 
with binoculars, as though searching for our next destination in its silvered 
face. CHARLES T. POWERS, Powers was The Times' Nairobi bureau chief from 1980 
to 1986. Since 1987, he has headed the paper's Warsaw bureau.

STUDENT ACTIVISM WITHOUT BARRICADES; 
</P>

ABSENT GUNFIRE IN THE GULF, ABSENT A DRAFT, ABSENT BODY BAGS, AN ANTI-WAR 
MOVEMENT HAS JUMP-STARTED.

<TEXT>
<P>
If President Bush goes to war against Iraq, he should count on being shadowed 
by a large, angry anti-war movement. Students will not necessarily lead, but 
commentators who see nothing but Republicans and hear nothing but silence on 
campuses may be surprised by the level of student activism. 
</P>
<P>
The skeptics commonly invoke "the 1960s" as proof that today's students are 
largely apathetic. But they wrongly compare the uncertain pre-war present to 
the high tide of campus protest in 1967-70, when U.S. casualties in the Vietnam 
War numbered in the tens of thousands. The more appropriate comparison is 
between today and the period stretching from 1963 through early 1965, when some 
25,000 American "advisers" were in South Vietnam but the fighting was 
small-scale. 
</P>
<P>
In 1963, there was some campus unease: The National Student Assn. condemned the 
repressive policies of South Vietnamese Premier Ngo Dinh Diem and supported the 
self-immolating Buddhists. But anti-war demonstrations were few. The war was 
remote, the country unmobilized and students were exempt from the draft. Even 
the dubious Tonkin Gulf incident and President Lyndon B. Johnson's initial 
bombing of North Vietnam didn't inspire much protest. 
</P>
<P>
Not until the spring of 1965, after U.S. bombing of North Vietnam became 
routine, did college protest emerge as a regular feature of the political 
landscape. Even so, apathy on campus was the norm. That spring, though, 25,000 
students marched in Washington; teach-ins began at the University of Michigan 
and spread to dozens of campuses -- all at a time when students still felt 
insulated from the draft. 
</P>
<P>
From then on, military deployment and anti-war demonstrations escalated in 
parallel. By 1969, when most students were touched by the threat of the draft 
(vastly more than were actually drafted), and 500,000 American troops were 
deployed in Vietnam, the same number of protesters marched on Washington, 
joined by millions from around the country. 
</P>
<P>
What is striking is that today -- absent a draft, absent a shooting war, absent 
body bags -- an anti-war movement has jump-started. For all the hesitations and 
cross-currents, there is already more protest than meets most eyes, and in the 
wake of Bush's decision to double the size of the U.S. forces in the Persian 
Gulf, it has begun to cross the media threshold. 
</P>
<P>
Even before the President's decision, teach-ins were being reinvented, 
sometimes by veterans of the Vietnam teach-ins of 1965, sometimes by minority 
faculty, sometimes by students who had never heard the term. By now, teach-ins 
have brought out 1,200 students at UC Santa Barbara, 400 and then 500 at UC 
Davis, 300 and then 900 at UC Berkeley, 300 and another 500 at San Jose State, 
1,500 at the University of Michigan. Rallies have drawn 1,000 at Stanford and 
the University of Minnesota, 250 at Indiana, 100 at Chicago's Loyola and 50 at 
Texas A&amp;M -- where the managing editor of the student newspaper said that 
"the fact that it happened at all is pretty significant." In mid-October, there 
were anti-war demonstrations in 20 cities. Fifteen hundred signed an anti-war 
petition at Notre Dame. There have been anti-war vigils at Western Michigan 
University, hunger strikes at Juniata College in Pennsylvania and at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most remarkable protests have taken place at the University of 
Montana. On a cold and rainy Halloween, 600 students marched through downtown 
Missoula chanting, "Hell no, we won't go, we won't fight for Texaco," and 
singing, "Give Peace a Chance." Back on campus, they marched through school 
buildings and disrupted classes, sparking a controversy. But they also 
succeeded in getting a resolution through the student senate supporting 
negotiations in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Montana anti-war coalition embraces pro-life as well as pro-choice groups 
(at one meeting, they both agreed to take down their signs), fraternities, 
Central American, black and women activists. It has already mobilized as high 
as percentage of students against war as at most campuses during most of the 
Vietnam War. The anti-war leaders have urged their people to send gifts to the 
soldiers camped in the Saudi desert -- a stunning turnabout from the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
What do these students want? The consensus is simple: No war; negotiate a 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't believe the government," says Nicholas Tripcevich, 20, a journalism 
major. "They have ulterior motives." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Parks, 23, a recent graduate and now a research assistant in political 
science, and one of the organizers of the protests, supports the U.N. economic 
embargo of Iraq but doesn't think "the U.S. should be policing the world." As 
for Saddam Hussein: "He is a fascist dictator, a torturer." But she is 
unequivocal about wanting the American troops out, perhaps to be replaced by 
U.N. forces. 
</P>
<P>
None of this is to say that the majority of students are anti-war -- or 
pro-war. While campus groups have organized to send gifts to the troops, few 
campuses have seen vociferous pro-war sentiment. The more common reactions are 
bafflement, concern, ambivalence, apprehension lest the draft return and 
annoyance that the prospect of war may disrupt personal plans. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect of war is not on every lip; as usual, many students do not follow 
the news much. "The thing that upsets me," says Rosa Ehrenreich, an organizer 
of Harvard protests, "is that Harvard students just aren't worried about the 
possibility of a war occurring. They say that Harvard students are the future 
leaders of the world, but I think it would be nice if they paid more attention 
to important world issues now." 
</P>
<P>
Where are the 1960s activists? Anti-war Vietnam vets mobilized quickly. Ron 
Kovic, the most celebrated, speaks at rallies and has taped an anti-war TV 
spot. On Dec. 3, 80 Bay Area anti-war veterans blocked morning traffic into the 
Alameda Air Station; 16 were arrested. Their coalition, which includes 
Republicans, continues and expands; future actions are planned. Veterans of the 
anti-war movement, many of them now faculty, have spoken at teach-ins and 
counseled students on tactics. Some parents have encouraged their student sons 
and/or daughters to take action. 
</P>
<P>
But many veterans of the '60s anti-war movement, especially men, were late to 
oppose the U.S. deployment in the gulf -- as long as it was small, tied to U.N. 
sanctions, nominally defensive and multilateral. Furthermore, the vicious 
Hussein could never be kindly old Uncle Saddam. Many former anti-war activists 
thus felt caught between paradigms -- wondering whether the closer analog was 
World War II or Vietnam, collective security or U.S. aggression. Protectiveness 
toward Israel played a part in muting protest as well. Some early protesters 
alienated potential support by refusing to condemn the seizure of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But as the military deployment swells, especially after the midterm elections, 
many activists who had supported the defense of Saudi Arabia in August were 
changing their minds in November. If the U.S. objective was to stop aggression, 
they asked, why not keep up the sanctions, enforce them with troops under U.N. 
command and contain Hussein? 
</P>
<P>
As in Vietnam, it is not elite students, or their friends or relatives, who are 
slogging through the Arabian sand. But new anti-war fronts have mobilized, 
partly because of the changing profile of student activism since the '60s and 
partly because of the unisex and disproportionately black armed forces. Women 
and minorities are conspicuous in the anti-war leadership; so are students at 
non-elite colleges, where many reservists began to question the saintliness of 
U.S. foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
The protests are centered in the West and Midwest, where anti-war sentiment 
traditionally ran strong before the Cold War. Still, today, a troubled economy 
discourages many students from stepping out of line. The prospect of war is not 
the same as war -- most students do not disrupt their lives because of even 
odds. But these factors will not keep the campuses from exploding if U.S. 
forces go to war. 
</P>
<P>
True, most students might well support the President in the early days of a 
shooting war -- just as most students supported Johnson's escalation in 1965. 
But if body bags start arriving at Dover Air Force Base, student bodies will 
quickly polarize, with the potential for violent clashes. Anti-war sentiment 
will mushroom, taking a variety and sometimes a muddle of forms -- pacifist, 
multilateralist, anti-imperialist, isolationist, even anti-Semitic 
(unfortunately, there are already those who mutter about the prospect of "Jew 
war"). 
</P>
<P>
Still, as in the mid-but-not-late '60s, most of today's student anti-warriors 
are sophisticated about cementing alliances on a single common principle: 
prevent war. Unlike their '60s counterparts, they start with the understanding 
that America is not their enemy (the public is divided about the wisdom of 
going to war in the gulf). Some radicals, meanwhile, want to seize the chance 
to change the overall political temper, but the majority of student activists 
will be content to secure peace. 
</P>
<P>
The Montana experience suggests how quickly militancy can escalate even on a 
campus where many, perhaps most, students are apathetic. And, of course, 
campuses will not be the only sites of protest. Minorities are already in 
evidence at anti-war rallies; churches will mobilize, too. 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Parks at Montana says: "I know a lot of people who are against the Bush 
Administration's deployment, but until an actual shot is fired, those people 
will not come out of their closets. 'I'm not going to demonstrate until people 
start dying' -- they've told me that. Which I think is idiocy. If we do go to a 
full-fledged war, it'll be interesting to see them join us." The Montana 
protesters already have a plan: As soon as the first shot is fired, boycott 
classes and march to City Hall. The same idea is circulating around the 
country.

WHY SILENT FILMS ROARED WITH THE REALITY OF THEIR TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Brownlow, Kevin Brownlow, a documentary filmmaker and historian, has 
also written Hollywood: The Pioneers and Napoleon. Films shape people's 
perceptions of reality. Now, through research by film historian Kevin Brownlow 
for Behind the Mask of Innocence, movie buffs learn that the loss of films also 
distorts the memory of an entire era. An excerpt: 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The silent era is celebrated for its innocence. The charming picture it 
presents of America in the early years of the century has led people to assume 
that life was quieter then, gentler and more civilized. 
</P>
<P>
But the silent era recorded another America. It revealed the corruption of city 
politics, the scandal of white-slave rackets, the exploitation of immigrants. 
Gangsters, procurers and loan sharks flashed across the same screen as Mary 
Pickford, but their images have mostly been destroyed, leaving us with an 
unbalanced portrait of an era. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that one day, those films which give us an accurate impression of how 
people lived will be regarded as precious as the most imaginative flights of 
fiction. 
</P>
<P>
Our view of the silent era is conditioned by the minuscule number of films in 
circulation -- films which have selected themselves by virtue of their 
availability. . . . While few of these films made history, all of them -- if 
only for a few moments -- recorded it. 
</P>
<P>
The early films were made to a pattern which had proved its commercial value on 
the popular stage. Give the audience someone to identify with, bring in "heart 
interest," a pretty girl or an appealing child, and wind up with a happy 
ending. Into this you can mix whatever theme you want. Banal it may sound, but 
some remarkable films were made with this formula. 
</P>
<P>
. . . If the subject of prostitution were to be shown, a parable set in 
biblical times might (just) be acceptable to the bluenoses. Imagine their shock 
when upon the screen appeared modern settings, realistic playing and equally 
realistic prostitutes! No matter that such films were animated by reforming 
zeal. What of their effect upon adolescent boys? 
</P>
<P>
Sadly, even these realistic films stopped short of attacking the system that 
led to prostitution. Melodramatic devices would place the police in the role of 
heroes; a love affair would end a corrupt regime in City Hall; an evil factory 
owner would be redeemed by a worker's child. Melodrama was an antidote to the 
sting of truth. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, that sting sometimes penetrated the hokum, to the discomfiture of 
those in authority. They took their ideas from the newspapers. The stories of 
many one- and two-reelers, especially those of D.W. Griffith, were adapted from 
current issues. Many workers, illiterate and foreign-born, read no newspapers, 
and the nickelodeon was thus a source of astonishment. Nickelodeons were 
sometimes seen as breeding grounds for crime and sedition. 
</P>
<P>
. . . The movies were born into the era of reform, which (roughly) opened with 
the inauguration of President Theodore Roosevelt in 1901 and closed with the 
entry of the United States into the First World War in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
. . . If the movies never quite lived up to the reformers' expectations -- 
either by preventing revolution or by causing it -- they did eventually become 
the most powerful medium of communication in the world -- a universal language. 
In order to outdo the rivalry of the press, they had to forego what a newspaper 
contained -- hard news, preaching and propaganda -- and become a reliable 
source of entertainment. Soon, even newsreels were full of hokum, extolling 
flagpole squatters and stunt flyers, but avoiding industrial or political 
unrest. In the '20s, if a film set out to educate rather than to entertain, 
audiences knew, by some sixth sense, how to avoid it. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Countless social or message pictures had played on people's sense of 
outrage, and they had grown tired of feeling ashamed or indignant when they 
went to the movies. A producer's wisecrack -- "If you want to send a message, 
send it Western Union" -- summed up the desire to rid the movie theater of the 
problem picture. As people stayed away from war films once the war was over, so 
they stayed away from social pictures once the era of reform was over. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Only one filmmaker in America devoted an entire career to making what 
were known as "thought films." That filmmaker was a woman, Lois Weber, who 
worked as a reformer within the industry. Born in Allegheny, Pa., and educated 
in Pittsburgh, her ambition was to cultivate her voice in New York. Her parents 
refused, so she ran away, with eight dollars, only to find her music instructor 
had gone abroad. Too proud to return home, she endured the kind of poverty she 
so vividly captured in her films. 
</P>
<P>
. . . Eventually, she joined a musical comedy company, became an actress and 
met her husband, Phillips Smalley. But she never forgot the immigrants and 
their struggles. "I came suddenly to realize the blessings of a voiceless 
language to them," she said. As a filmmaker she decided to make what she called 
"missionary pictures." Some of these she made with her husband (both were 
Christian Scientists), but she was always the dominant partner. 
</P>
<P>
"I like to direct," she said, "because I believe a woman, more or less 
intuitively, brings out many of the emotions that are rarely expressed on the 
screen. I may miss what some of the men get, but I will get other effects that 
they never thought of." 
</P>
<P>
The range of subjects Weber tackled was as astonishing as the speed with which 
she produced them. "Suspense" (1913) outdid Griffith in its technical wizardry. 
"Civilized and Savage" (1913) had Smalley as a white man nursed to health by a 
black woman (Weber), who, her task complete, sets out to find his wife. 
</P>
<P>
In 1915, Weber created her first sensation, "The Hypocrites." A four-reeler 
made the previous year, it was held back because of its inflammatory treatment. 
Using an allegorical style, with multiple exposures, to flay politics, big 
business and the church, it further shocked the Establishment by having a naked 
girl play the figure of Truth. Audiences flocked to see the nudity and were 
then obliged to sit through the moral lesson, upsetting to many of them. The 
nudity was filmed so innocently that few boards of censors could ban it. There 
were several attempts; the Catholic mayor of Boston demanded that Truth be 
draped, so clothes were allegedly painted, frame by frame, onto the film! 
</P>
<P>
. . . Weber continued to make social films well into the Jazz Age, when she 
suffered the rejection of audiences. She and Smalley were divorced in 1922 -- 
he had become an alcoholic -- and her company failed. She made a few more 
pictures, one of which, "The Angel of Broadway" (1927), combined the cynicism 
of the '20s (nightclub parodies of the Salvation Army) with the commitment of 
the reform era (social work in the slums). It was her last silent film, and by 
1930 she was managing an apartment building.

<TEXT>
<P>
The camera scans the Congress of People's Deputies, where a brand new political 
system is being created. It is a sea of male faces. On the brink of the next 
decade and a new millennium, the world's freshest democracy turns out to be the 
same old men's club. 
</P>
<P>
Where are the women of the Soviet Union, if not here in the corridors of power? 
They are 53% of the population and a mere 5% of this new elected body. "The 
women are in the kitchen," says Stas Borevich, a 23-year-old linguistics 
student from the Urals. Like most Muscovites, he hasn't much noticed the 
absence of women in the new government. 
</P>
<P>
Under the old regime, there was a 30% quota for women in the Communist Party, 
but none sat in the ruling Politburo; fewer than a dozen served on the 
307-member Central Committee. The old propaganda cranked out to the West, 
depicting women practicing medicine and driving steamrollers, contended that 
the Soviet Union was the place where women were "liberated" first. But as any 
visitor here can see, and as Francine du Plessix Gray has documented in her 
book "Soviet Women: Walking the Tightrope," the alleged progress was a myth. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet women have had an equal opportunity to work at many traditionally male 
jobs, particularly since so many Soviet men died during World War II. Women 
were needed to fill out the factory production lines and some of the 
professions, including medicine. But doctors aren't treated with the same 
status and income here as they are in the United States; in medicine and 
elsewhere, Soviet women have remained stuck in the lowest-paying jobs in a 
culture that doesn't seem to value their contributions equally with men's. 
</P>
<P>
"Have you ever seen a woman in our official (Soviet) delegations?" asks Vera 
Soboleva, head of the international department of the Soviet Women's Committee, 
an officially sanctioned organization with 3 million members. She observes that 
this dearth of women hasn't changed under perestroika; a typical recent 
example, she says, was the official all-male delegation of 26 Soviets visiting 
the United States to study marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet women didn't rise to positions of real economic or political power 
before glasnost and perestroika -- and there's no evidence that they are rising 
now. In fact, there's every reason to believe that Soviet women are losing 
ground in the changing system here. It's uncertain what will replace the few 
supports they had under the old system: state-sponsored day-care for children, 
health care, assured jobs. These were hopelessly inadequate under the old 
Soviet regime, but they were better than the looming void. 
</P>
<P>
Many Soviets, men and women alike, are skeptical that the new political system 
will actually produce anything better, so it's not surprising that those who 
face the greatest political obstacles aren't trying to participate. "Women have 
never been serious policy-makers here," says Natalia Gevvorkyan, a 33-year-old 
reporter for Moscow News. "We still do not have any formal feminist movement. 
Most of the women here do not see how to change their lives for the better." 
</P>
<P>
All this makes the United States look like a feminist haven, even though 
American feminists are quite rightly discouraged these days. The American 
feminist faces the loss of abortion rights under the Supreme Court, the 
backlash against affirmative-action laws and the political indifference to 
President Bush's veto of the Family and Medical Leave Act. That legislation 
would have eased the burden on working women by guaranteeing men and women 
unpaid time off to contend with births, adoptions or family medical 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the American women's movement, however disheartened it may seem today, has 
produced significant and lasting cultural changes that don't exist in the 
Soviet Union. An estimated 92% of adult Soviet women work for wages, taking 
care of their children and, often, their aging parents, in a culture that 
discourages men from helping at home. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet women also wait in line for an estimated family average of 2 1/2 hours 
each day to buy food and other staples. "We don't have things that are 
absolutely necessary for women -- Tampax, medicine," Ms. Gevvorkyan observes. 
Finding birth-control devices or pills is very difficult. In 1987, there were 
115 abortions for every 100 live births in the Soviet Union; often both 
abortions and births were without anesthesia, according to feminist publisher 
Tatyana Mamonova, who recently was a visiting scholar at the City University of 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
Without a culture that supports women's basic needs, it's not surprising that 
the few Soviet women who have gotten elected to office have worked to 
ingratiate themselves with the dominant male power structure rather than to 
challenge its priorities. They "sometimes are very shy to present women's 
issues," Soboleva observes. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, Svetlanta Goriatchev, a deputy to Russian Republic President Boris N. 
Yeltsin and therefore one of the highest-ranking women in the new political 
order, doesn't follow the feminist line. As Soboleva and others fight for 
access to birth control, Goriatchev is actively pushing for Russian mothers to 
have more babies. While feminists are worrying about who will pay for day-care 
centers and how women will survive in the less protective market economy, 
Goriatchev is advocating the popular fantasy that women should return to the 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"The child-care system doesn't make the life of the mother easier. The best 
possibility would be to remain home in the first year," she says, disregarding 
the fact that most Soviet women aren't economically able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
Even Gevvorkyan, who aspires to be a foreign correspondent and assumes her 
editors will never select a woman for such a post, declares: "I am not a 
feminist." 
</P>
<P>
If anything, young women here are heading in the opposite direction -- holding 
up the 1950s suburban American ideal. They dream of staying home, dependent on 
their new capitalistic, presumably affluent husbands. "There is a huge movement 
among Soviet women to show how fragile they are. It's partly because things 
have been so tough here," explains Irene Stevenson, an American woman who is 
working as a translator at TASS, the official Soviet news agency. 
</P>
<P>
At a contest in the Baltic Sea region to select "the best wife" in the area, 
Stevenson reports, contestants were asked, among other things, "If a volcano 
was exploding, what hairstyle would you wear?" While that might be an extreme 
example, there is much evidence of a feminine -- rather than a feminist -- 
movement here. "Traveling in the Soviet Union, one is immediately struck by the 
passionate interest evidenced by the generation under 45 in traditional 
domestic rituals -- cooking, sewing, embroidery -- which their grandmothers 
never had the time (or the permission) to indulge in," writes Du Plessix Gray. 
</P>
<P>
Understandably, Soviet women are exhausted -- even more than America's 
superwomen, who at least have supermarkets and high-tech gadgets to help them 
juggle their double lives. "Many see how their mothers lived and don't want to 
follow their example," concludes Vera Soboleva of the Soviet Women's Committee. 
But the dilemma is that in order to improve their lives significantly, they 
need to take on still another time-consuming and thankless job -- that of 
fighting for the kind of political leverage needed to secure greater economic, 
cultural and political standing for women in Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
"Some women think only about their everyday needs," Soboleva laments. "They 
don't understand that if we don't change thinking on a general global level, 
their everyday needs will never be changed."

POLITICS: THE DEBATE OVER STRUCTURAL CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT HAS GONE NOWHERE.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his most recent statements, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has outlined an 
essentially new structure of Soviet government. At the same time, figures in 
the top echelons of power have been moved around. Add to this the unexpected 
resignation of Eduard A. Shevardnadze. All these developments may signify the 
emergence of a new "power policy" in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of power is widely debated in the Soviet Union today. Whenever there 
is a need to describe the debate's status, the most frequently used word -- 
whether the describer be leftist, rightist, housewife or the president -- is 
"paralysis." 
</P>
<P>
But consider: Although perhaps no one deliberately arranged it, there is simply 
no better way to distract the people's attention from their constantly 
deteriorating living conditions than by making them witnesses or participants 
in the personnel rotation or structural changes at the top of the pyramid of 
power. 
</P>
<P>
Paradoxically, the liquidation of the Presidential Council, the first cabinet 
created by Gorbachev, went almost unnoticed. Most people treated it with total 
indifference. One reason could be that the council was the first child of the 
early presidential system, set up according to rather vague principles and for 
no clear purposes. By all indications, Gorbachev himself did not have a 
distinct view of the council's goals and tasks and gradually concluded that he 
had got it wrong. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the council played a "historical role," the favorite ranking of the 
current political parlance. It had been instrumental in stripping, overnight, 
the Politburo of its total power. After the prime minister, the heads of 
defense, state security, police and foreign policy moved from the Politburo to 
the Presidential Council. The Politburo, omnipotent for decades, had 
practically lost all relevance. The indifference that greeted the demise of the 
council was undeserved, to say the least. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, for some of its former members, life will hardly change. Both Dmitri 
T. Yazov, the defense minister, and Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, the head of the KGB, 
will continue in their jobs. Most probably, Yevgeny M. Primakov and Vadim A. 
Medvedev will not be left out in the cold -- the former was rumored to be 
eyeing Shevardnadze's job as foreign minister, while the latter has already 
performed as the president's personal envoy abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Others may not be so lucky. Valentin Rasputin, Alexander N. Yakovlev and 
Stanislav S. Shatalin could find their future a bit cloudy. True, Shatalin 
remains the head of the economics department at the Academy of Sciences, and 
Rasputin is a renowned writer. But both positions carry much less status in the 
public's perceptions. It is revealing that no rumors of new jobs for Shatalin 
and Rasputin are circulating. It is quite possible that one of the hidden 
motives behind the liquidation of the Presidential Council was a desire to 
remove certain figures from active politics. 
</P>
<P>
But what should be expected of the new generation manning the new posts at the 
top? Further fragmentation of power, caused by the continuing co-existence of 
old and new institutions, may prove to be an ineffective medicine against this 
pernicious disease -- the paralysis of power. 
</P>
<P>
Competition among institutions may easily be aggravated by rivalry among 
personalities vying for Gorbachev's ear and for influence. Beside the president 
will appear a vice president; beside the vice president will stand a prime 
minister. If the projected National Security Council gets a boss, or a 
coordinator, he, too, will demand a say in the decision-making process. 
</P>
<P>
The American experience shows that the national-security adviser is not always 
prepared to yield to the vice president or the secretary of state in the 
struggle for the presidential ear. Besides, can we accept, as a rational 
solution, this mixture of the American model of government (a vice president, 
but no prime minister) with the British (prime minister but no president) and 
the French (president and prime minister)? 
</P>
<P>
Vadim Bakatin, the former interior minister, is considered a leading contender 
for the top job at the National Security Council. But the nature of the charges 
leveled against him by conservatives may preclude such an appointment. He is 
being accused of wrecking the national police force, the militia, and of 
conniving with separatists within its ranks. Bakatin was also the first to 
depoliticize his force, abolishing the political departments throughout the 
chain of command. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks before his dismissal, Bakatin sent a tough-worded letter to Anatoly 
L. Lukyanov, chairman of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature. Among 
other things, it said: "It's useless to look for the origins of the present 
power paralysis in the ineffective work of the militia. This inefficiency is a 
mere consequence. As for the true reasons, they are numerous, but a fundamental 
one is the fact that in 73 years of the Soviet power, we have failed to create 
an executive mechanism stopping arbitrariness of power. In this country, the 
ultimate authority just spits at the law. When this happens, the militia, which 
cannot oppose the power, is left powerless." 
</P>
<P>
The greatest controversies, of course, rage around the government of Prime 
Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov: Will he retain his post when it is transformed 
under Gorbachev's proposed constitutional changes, and who will become vice 
president? 
</P>
<P>
The leading vice-presidential candidates are Shevardnadze and, despite all his 
unpopularity, Ryzhkov. Another name has begun to pop up -- Grigory A. 
Yavlinsky, co-author of the famous 500 Days program of economic reforms. 
Although the economist, who recently stepped down as the Russian deputy prime 
minister, has a bright political future, any such rise to power still appears 
premature. 
</P>
<P>
A much more plausible vice-presidential figure is Nursultan Nazarbayev, the 
Kazakh president who is reported to have discussed the offer to run for the job 
with his aides. Nazarbayev traveled to Paris with Gorbachev last month. Such 
trips, experience teaches, usually presage new appointments. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from Ryzhkov, another name being mentioned for prime minister is Arkady 
Volsky. A former official of the party Central Committee, he headed the 
committee sent to govern Nagorno Karabakh and now leads the Soviet Science and 
Industry Assn. Both Ryzhkov and Volsky enjoy support from the captains of 
industry, and this may prove the decisive factor in their favor in the race 
with other contenders. 
</P>
<P>
The changes in the second echelons of power are no less interesting. The 
appointment of Gen. Boris Gromov, the former commander of the 40th Army in 
Afghanistan, as deputy interior minister may signal a shift toward 
militarization of governing methods and the access to power of the new 
generation of generals with actual fighting experience. In the light of the 
widening calls for a strong-arm government, this does not appear very 
encouraging. On the other hand, some analysts believe Gromov has been moved 
into a no-win position precisely with the aim of separating him from the army. 
</P>
<P>
Whether this is so no one can say for sure. When Gorbachev begins his moves, 
especially in personnel changes, no guess as to his ultimate goal is sound.

SCHOOL AT STANFORD AND OTHER PLACES ARE WORKING TO EXPAND THE POOL.

<TEXT>
<P>
Not long ago, Harvard Law School students did what law-school students learn to 
do -- they filed a suit charging race and sex discrimination against their 
school in its hiring of law professors. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the fall, 35 Berkeley law students had demonstrated at their dean's 
office to protest a dearth of minority law professors. Harvard Law Professor 
Derrick Bell is still boycotting his teaching duties to protest the school's 
failure to hire and tenure a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
The protests point in one direction: From coast to coast, law schools are under 
pressure to diversify their faculty. It is not unlike the movement to make 
colleges diversify their student enrollments, which has now been confused by 
the Bush Administration's muddled stand on minority scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
Law deans still insist that they face a bottleneck: the small supply of 
minority law graduates who seek teaching jobs and meet traditional criteria to 
be hired as professors. A few schools have decided to address the problem 
head-on, by starting programs to train minority law graduates in the fine arts 
of legal scholarship and writing for law journals. 
</P>
<P>
"Our aim is to take people who might have difficulty going from where they are 
now into law teaching," said Paul Brest, dean of Stanford Law School. "We're 
interested in people who have potential, but don't necessarily have the writing 
experience or the credentials." 
</P>
<P>
Stanford's Program for Aspiring Law Teachers just began its third year. It 
admits two students per year and lasts two years. It provides a tuition waiver, 
a $24,000 stipend and the opportunity to do research under the guidance of 
faculty members, publish and teach. Of the program's graduates, one teaches at 
the University of Santa Clara Law School in California; one teaches law and 
history at the University of Puerto Rico; and the third is now interviewing for 
a teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
The oldest of these programs is the Hastie Fellowship at the University of 
Wisconsin Law School, started in 1973. "Professor James E. Jones Jr. started 
the ball rolling," said Stephen Rocha, assistant dean at Wisconsin Law School. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he was sick of hearing that there were no qualified minorities. He 
hoped the fellowship could be a model, by training people to increase the pool. 
If every school started a program, it would take only a few years to get a 
critical mass of people out there." Seventeen lawyers have gone through the 
one-year Hastie Fellowship; eight are now teaching at well-known law schools, 
including Cornell, UCLA, Notre Dame and the State University of New York at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown University Law School has just started its own Future Law Teachers 
Program. It accepts one student per year, lasts 18 months, and pays a yearly 
stipend of $20,000. Regina Jefferson, the first participant, is a George 
Washington University Law School graduate who formerly worked for the Internal 
Revenue Service. "She is just terrific. We are confident that she will be 
launched into an outstanding teaching career," said Associate Dean Peter 
Edelman. The University of Iowa began a pilot program this fall, structured a 
little differently. Its participant is treated like an assistant professor and 
is paid an attractive salary. 
</P>
<P>
The programs are not cheap. Brest estimates that the annual cost of Stanford's 
program is $40,000 per fellow, including stipend and foregone tuition but not 
overhead. The program receives some funding from the Irvine and Borshcard 
foundations and several alumni. The University of Iowa's proposals to private 
foundations have estimated its program's annual cost at $100,000 per 
participant. So far, it has not received outside funding. Wisconsin's Hastie 
Fellowship has permanent university funding; Georgetown's program is funded by 
the law school. 
</P>
<P>
Can such programs make a difference? Law students and professors have been 
arguing for years about the number of minorities qualified to be law 
professors. The Association of American Law Schools' registry currently lists 
859 persons seeking law teaching jobs in the United States. Richard A. Matasar, 
assistant dean at the University of Iowa Law School, has found that 93 are 
members of minorities: 53 (or 6.2%) are black, 27 (3.1%) are Hispanic, 9 (1%) 
are Asian or Pacific Islander, and 4 (0.5%) are Native American or Alaskan 
Native. 
</P>
<P>
The registry is not a complete list; nonetheless, this supply must be compared 
with the demand for minority faculty, given that there are 174 accredited law 
schools in the United States. Law-teacher programs could, it seems, 
significantly affect the size of the minority pool. 
</P>
<P>
The programs can also have an impact on the quality or apparent quality of the 
pool. This topic is controversial. One painful truth is that black students do 
not finish college with test scores or grades comparable to other students. Law 
School Admission Council's latest figures show that, in 1988, only 2.7 percent 
of black law applicants (163 students) nationwide had a Law School Admission 
Test score over 34 (on a scale of 10 to 48) and a grade point average over 
3.25, compared with over 24 percent of white applicants. 
</P>
<P>
Leading law schools seeking to diversify their student bodies admitted many 
black students with scores and grades lower than the average admittee. This 
policy met important goals, but it had an effect on the performance of black 
law students. At 10 top law schools in the late 1980s, the overall grades of 
the average first-year black student ranked at the eighth percentile of all 
students. This pattern means that it may be some time before black students are 
proportionately represented among law- review editors, who are traditionally 
selected by grades and later prized as law faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, many people criticize the weight placed on law-school grades. "We 
don't believe that the traditional criteria are the be-all and end-all of 
getting good faculty members," said Matasar. "We have minority and non-minority 
faculty members who don't have that profile but have other indications that 
they will be excellent scholars and teachers." 
</P>
<P>
The law-teacher programs give gifted lawyers a chance to improve their skills 
and to show their stuff by publishing. They also show law-school hiring 
committees that they are not compromising standards when they hire a minority 
professor. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a product, a published piece," said Winnie Taylor, a former Hastie 
Fellow now teaching at Cornell Law School. "People look at the evidence before 
them." 
</P>
<P>
In the paper she wrote during her fellowship, Taylor made recommendations to 
combat discrimination that were later incorporated into the federal Equal 
Opportunity Credit Act. "It gives you an opportunity to cut your first piece. 
The more articles you write, the better you become." 
</P>
<P>
All of which shows, as one administrator said, that with a little effort and a 
broader vision, the pool is bigger than people think.

In regard to the story on wildlife "overpopulation" in national parks, 
monuments, etc., I would offer another solution not considered in the article: 
Declare an open season on developers, vacation homeowners, ranchers using 
public lands, logging operation and mineral companies who are in hot pursuit of 
the almighty dollar in the lands surrounding our natural treasures. 
</P>
<P>
The problem in fact is not too many animals. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that there is not enough wild land to keep wildlife wild. 
Attempting to confine wild animals within these artificial boundaries (on 
penalty of death) turns our national parks into nothing more than glorified 
zoos. It is crucial that adequate buffer zones and corridors be protected now 
to preserve this nation's real heritage -- its wild lands and animals.

NOW THE SPOTLIGHT IS ON HAITI'S ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mere fact that Haiti held a democratic election is inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the awesome poverty there, the brutishness of the Duvalier 
dictatorship that ruled the island until recently and the tendency for almost 
everything to go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
During the Duvalier years especially, Haitians lived with horrific violence; it 
continued even after their overthrow. Further bloodshed murdered the last 
serious attempt at an election, in 1987. Who could possibly have hoped that 
last week's voting would prove so peaceful? 
</P>
<P>
But now the near-impossible task of getting an impoverished nation of 6 million 
people on its feet goes to Jean-Bertrand Aristide, a former Roman Catholic 
priest who was elected president with 70% of the popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide is widely known in Haiti -- and feared in some upper-class circles -- 
for his fierce advocacy on behalf of the poor. He now has an undeniable popular 
mandate, and only time will tell how the often-fiery sermonizer uses it. That's 
the main thing worrying many of Aristide's critics in Haiti's small but 
influential elite class. They ask if a 37-year-old cleric with no experience in 
government can effectively run a nation impoverished by generations of 
underdevelopment as well as three decades of having the treasury looted by 
Duvaliers. 
</P>
<P>
It's a legitimate question, but nobody can know the answer until Aristide 
actually has a chance to govern. And one suspects that his odds of success will 
increase to the extent he is offered the guidance and support of the Haitian 
elite that so fears him. The possibility is not out of the question. Most of 
Haiti's upper crust disapproved of the Duvaliers, too, but were able to support 
them when it became necessary to keep the country afloat. If they could deal 
with thugs like the Duvaliers, Haiti's elite should be able to live with 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
Aristide will also need outside help, especially economic aid. It was most 
encouraging that the United States was one of the first countries to weigh in 
with a public show of support for Aristide after the election results became 
known. 
</P>
<P>
Bernard Aronson, the assistant secretary of state who handles Latin America, 
said this county respects the electoral mandate Aristide has "and looks forward 
to working closely with his government." Aronson also went beyond the normal 
diplomatic niceties and quoted a Haitian proverb to Aristide: "The more hands 
offered the lighter the load." The clear implication is that one of those hands 
will be Uncle Sam's. If enough leaders in Haiti, and around the world, share 
Aronson's generous spirit, then the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere 
has a chance at genuine democracy -- and maybe even minimal prosperity.

In reality, the same ranchers and hunters John Balzar consulted ("Animal 
Populations Put Parks in a Bind," Part A, Dec. 17) are the source of the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
Until they drop their opposition to the restoration of the gray wolf to 
Yellowstone, we can look forward to annual scenes of hunters lined up like 
firing squads and mowing down buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
For tens of thousands of years the wolf has been the key component in keeping 
prey base populations in balance to any ecosystem the wolf is indigenous to. We 
can no longer plead ignorance in barring his return to Yellowstone. It is 
simple stupidity.

That animal-rights activists are opposed to the efforts of wildlife ecologists 
is not surprising. The idea of rights for animals has on the surface an easy 
emotional appeal to people interested in environmental issues; however, the 
animal-rights philosophy is severely inconsistent, especially with respect to 
wild animals and plants. 
</P>
<P>
The attempt to endow animals, like people, with individual rights is 
unrealistic and turns a blind eye to our most severe environmental problems. 
Animals cannot make moral decisions, and many species must eat one another. 
There is no mechanism in animal rights to resolve extinction-threatening 
conflicts among species of animals and no real means of resolving the impacts 
of human population growth on the Earth. Real solutions to environmental 
problems will require, in the short term, conservation of major tracts of 
wilderness habitat with native plants, herbivores and carnivores and in the 
long term, stabilization of the growth of the human population and its 
economies.

IS THE ANGOLAN NIGHTMARE FINALLY OVER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Imagine. Nearly 16 years of a brutal civil war funded largely by the United 
States and the Soviet Union is coming to an end. Angolans may actually soon 
witness a little peace, stability and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III conferred recently with Pedro Van Dunem, 
the foreign minister of the Moscow-backed Angolan government. Soviet Foreign 
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze also chatted for the first time with an old 
enemy -- the U.S.-backed Jonas Savimbi, head of the National Union for Total 
Independence of Angola (UNITA). 
</P>
<P>
The parallel sessions were held to smooth the way for peace negotiations 
scheduled next month in Portugal, the former colonial ruler of Angola. This 
coordinated push for peace is important, but not as essential as ending all 
military aid now. 
</P>
<P>
The Cold War motivated the expensive alliances. The Soviet Union annually 
dropped as much as $800 million into the Angolan blood bucket and sent more 
than 1,000 advisers to the then-Marxist government. The Cubans sent thousands 
of soldiers to this government, founded by the Popular Movement for the 
Liberation of Angola (MPLA) after Angola gained its independence in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
Washington countered with an annual $60 million in aid, including land mines 
and missiles to Savimbi and UNITA. Savimbi also enjoyed the backing of South 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
And what a cost! More than 300,000 Angolans died in the fighting. An estimated 
50,000 Angolans -- primarily women and children -- lost limbs from land mines. 
Another 20,000 children became orphans. A truce is overdue. 
</P>
<P>
It's not there yet. The Angolan government and UNITA have already agreed in 
principle to switch from a Marxist government to a multi-party democracy. After 
a cease-fire, free elections will be scheduled. Savimbi wants to run for 
president. But is the dictatorial -- some would say murderous -- leader willing 
to lead all Angolans? 
</P>
<P>
The war still takes its toll. Another 800,000 Angolans face starvation because 
of the battles and a punishing drought. The only good thing to say about this 
proxy war -- one that was manipulated by Cold War forces -- is that an end may 
be in sight.

Joseph Edmiston's statement regarding the "unrealistic" expectations of animal 
rights activists contains no more realism than that of his opponents or the 
most ardent laissez-faire industrialist, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
There is no "nature" out there: Edmiston's idea of what is out there is 
obviously in his head, and he fervently believes that his mind-set matches his 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
Neither does "the duck" of the rights activists exist: which of all the ducks 
to be seen is "the duck"? 
</P>
<P>
The most resolutely realistic action is, that when you turn that key to start 
your car, you in fact alter and poison the air. When you flush that toilet, you 
foul the water and when you put out your 3-plus cans with garbage, you pollute 
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, we are the most destructive organisms on the planet. Chances that 
conservationists, rights activists or industrialists will reverse that are 
exceedingly small. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the majority of the planet's population, not driving and flushing yet 
because it is yet developing, hopes to be driving and flushing by the end of 
the decade, or better yet, tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
In the final analysis, the distinction between rights activist and 
environmentalist platforms is moot: They don't deal with the real problem. It 
is not out there, it's in here. It is I.

Rudy Abramson's article: "Wildlife Act: Shield or Sword?" (Column One, Dec. 14) 
summarizes accurately and concisely the current situation with endangered 
species and related protective legislation. However, the article failed to 
discuss the main issue. 
</P>
<P>
Endangered species are a result of ever-increasing numbers of people seeking an 
ever-higher standard of living by exploiting the world's finite natural 
resources and thereby impacting fragile habitats. 
</P>
<P>
We are going the wrong way on a freeway during rush hour in our effort to 
defeat nature, which we obviously cannot do. It seems that our only real hope, 
for ourselves and our fellow species, lies in our willingness to change our 
highly materialistic value system and to realize that what is good for spotted 
owls, Louisiana bears and snail darters will ultimately be good for us. 
</P>
<P>
Mankind (particularly in the developed nations) now finds itself caught between 
two of its most basic motivations: greed and self-preservation. We have the 
inherent capability to dampen our appetites for material gain, but will we? Our 
track record up to this point leaves little room for optimism, even though our 
lives and those of future generations depend on our ability to adopt a more 
mature set of values.

On Christmas morning, in front of the marble fireplace in the nursery at 
Blenheim Palace, 6-year-old Winston Churchill deployed his regiments across the 
carpet and set up ambushes behind the chair legs, pretending to whip the French 
again at Blenheim as did his famous ancestor, the Duke of Marlborough. 
</P>
<P>
Amused at the child's concentration, his father, Lord Randolph Churchill, asked 
him if he would like someday to go into the army. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it would be splendid to command an army, so I answered YES at once," 
Churchill later wrote in his memoirs. "The toy soldiers turned the current of 
my life." 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur and Orville Wright were in grade school in Dayton, Ohio, when an uncle 
brought them a Christmas gift from Paris: a flying mechanical toy by Penaud, 
the famous French toy maker. After school, the brothers began selling toys of 
their own invention to earn pocket money to buy the science books that would 
one day lead to flight at Kitty Hawk, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
Young Frank Lloyd Wright erected his first building with Froebel blocks, 
introduced by the German educator Friedrich Froebel, who devised the 
kindergarten system of learning through play. 
</P>
<P>
The dream world of toys is the serious business of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
And, fortunately for today's multibillion-dollar toy industry, many adults 
throughout history never put away childish things. 
</P>
<P>
English Colonists arriving at Roanoke Island in 1585 greeted the Indians with 
gifts of knives, glass marbles and dolls. William Penn, when he came to 
Philadelphia in 1699, brought with him "Letitia," a doll gorgeously gowned in 
velvet and brocade. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Revere, who was a toy maker as well as a silversmith, made drums from nail 
kegs and baby rattles from gourds. In addition to playing with kites, Benjamin 
Franklin had a profitable sideline turning out "educational playing cards" in 
his Philadelphia print shop. 
</P>
<P>
French novelist George Sand presented 120 plays and designed all the costumes 
for her puppet theater at Chateau Nohant. Joseph Haydn composed operas for 
Prince Nicholas Esterhazy's toy theater. Johann Goethe, the German poet and 
playwright, made all the scenery for the puppet theater he gave to his son, 
August, for Christmas in 1800. English cabinetmakers Thomas Chippendale and 
Thomas Sheraton fashioned elegant doll furniture. 
</P>
<P>
It is not surprising that those who live by their imaginations cling more 
steadfastly than others to the fantasies of childhood. Cervantes, Anatole 
France, G. K. Chesterton and Robert Louis Stevenson were avid toy collectors. 
Lewis Carroll was a steady customer at Creamer's toy shop on London's Regent 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Toys are as old as civilization -- older, if you can envision a brontosaurus 
pup playing with a stone as a kitten worries a ball of yarn. Anthropologists 
assure us that cavemen played marbles-type games with nuts and dry berries. 
</P>
<P>
Egyptians who died as children were entombed with their beloved toys. The dolls 
of early Christians who died young were buried with them in the catacombs. 
</P>
<P>
The Chinese had kites from the 3rd Century BC. In 206 BC, Gen. Han-sin sent up 
a kite to gauge the distance between his camp and the palace of Emperor 
Wel-Yang Kong. 
</P>
<P>
American clipper ships brought home from China some sensational "new" toys that 
were already centuries old: the yo-yo, the merry-go-round and a weighted doll 
that was impossible to tip over, named "Daruma" for the monk who introduced 
Buddhism to China and whose legs were said to have withered away during nine 
years of contemplation. 
</P>
<P>
From the Middle Ages down to the present German toy makers in Nuremberg, 
Oberammergau, Berchtesgarden and Sonneberg excelled in imagination, 
craftsmanship and merchandising skills. Peddlers with sacks on their backs 
carried toys along the medieval trade routes of Europe, down the Brenner Pass 
into Italy. Some were women, called "notion nannies," who offered toys along 
with their regular wares of pots, pans and thread. 
</P>
<P>
The French were famous for wind-up toys. One French doll could "write perfect 
penmanship." Another played a melody on the harmonium, nodding her head as her 
fingers flitted over the keys, then stood up to take a bow. Marquis de Vauban, 
the French military engineer, devised for the Nuremberg toy makers an army that 
could march, shoot, reload and even retreat -- all made of sterling silver. 
</P>
<P>
Marie Antoinette, who loved and collected toys all her life, was shown a doll 
in an artist's smock by Henri Jaquez Druz, whose mechanical marvels delighted 
the Spanish royal family and who just missed being condemned as diabolical and 
burned at the stake during the Inquisition. The artist doll proceeded to sketch 
a credible likeness of the French queen as she sat for her portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, Marie Antoinette little realized then that her fate and that of her 
husband, Louis XVI, would create a demand for toy guillotines. Goethe asked a 
friend to bring him one from Paris. 
</P>
<P>
Grim toys are as enduringly popular as fairy tales. Children in ages past 
played with live birds on strings, kept crickets in cages and trained mice to 
pull wagons. Puppet shows made ogres of dwarfs, hunchbacks and cripples. Toy 
catalogues before World War I featured a music-box Titantic that played "Nearer 
My God to Thee" as it sank in the bathtub. 
</P>
<P>
"Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles" swords and nunchakus, a multimillion-dollar hit 
in this year's toy market after the success of the movie, have been blamed for 
rising playground violence in Australia and are banned from many classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
Clay horses and wooden knights fueled the fervor of the 30,000 boys and girls 
who followed Stephen, the French shepherd boy, on the Children's Crusade in 
1212. Many lost their lives in that deadly game of trying to free the Holy Land 
from the infidel. 
</P>
<P>
War toys were part of the education of a prince. Charles V of France, also 
known as Charles the Mad, received a toy cannon for Christmas in 1383. Emperor 
Maximilian of the Holy Roman Empire ordered toy knights that could be dislodged 
from their horses for his 10-year-old son, Ludwig. Six years later the lad was 
unhorsed and killed fighting the Turks. The future Louis XIV received for 
Christmas two sterling silver armies, each with a troop strength of 30 
regiments of cavalry and infantry. 
</P>
<P>
Then, as now, toy soldiers went to war with the most modern weapons. This year, 
G.I. Joe is mounted on the "Hum-Vee," the new Army "jeep" widely deployed with 
Operation Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
We think of Toyland as a fantasy world, but the most successful playthings 
always reproduced reality as the child knew it. Down through the centuries, 
chariots and archers, the stag hunt and farm and forest scenes gave way to 
royal carriages, cowboys and Indians, horse-drawn trolleys, Model T Fords, dump 
trucks, highway trailers, jet planes, rockets and space shuttles -- and now, a 
laptop computer just like Dad's or Mom's. 
</P>
<P>
Toy makers always keep up with the times. A political cartoon poking fun at 
Theodore Roosevelt for sparing the life of a bear cub while on a hunting 
expedition inspired the Ideal Toy Co. to ask permission to name a stuffed toy 
for him. "I don't think my name is worth much to the toy bear cub business, but 
you are welcome to use it," the President answered. He underestimated the 
timeless appeal of the teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the merry melody of the cash box, the dream world of toys has 
inspired countless poems, paintings, operas, ballets, plays, movies and pop 
songs. Robert Louis Stevenson's nostalgic evocation of his own sickly childhood 
is among the nicest: 
</P>
<P>
 'And sometimes for an hour or so 
</P>
<P>
 I watch my leaden soldiers go 
</P>
<P>
 With different uniforms and drills 
</P>
<P>
 Among the bedclothes through the hills.

SELMA'S 7-TERM MAYOR IS PLANNING TO STEP OFF THE RACIAL BALANCE BEAM; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: JOE SMITHERMAN HAS SURVIVED HIS CITY'S HISTORY AND CREATED SOME OF 
HIS OWN AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE FOR A QUARTER-CENTURY.

<P>
Shortly before a heart attack laid him up recently, Mayor Joe Smitherman was 
ruminating on the formula that has kept him in office for a quarter-century. 
Could it be that the one had something to do with the other? 
</P>
<P>
"You start a project," he was saying, "and before you finish it, start another, 
and before you finish that one, start another, and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"Be the busiest person in town, doing things for Selma that the people can see 
and touch. It never fails. It keeps your friends happy and your enemies off 
balance." 
</P>
<P>
Those who know Joe Smitherman, be they friends and enemies, agree that he is a 
man of action. They say he seems driven. He shoots from the hip -- runs on high 
octane and bases decisions more on gut instinct than deep thought. On this 
Sunday morning, though, Smitherman was in a reflective mood. 
</P>
<P>
The mayor observes a sort of Sabbath ritual. He rises early, drives downtown 
and parks behind City Hall. He enters through a back door, plugs in the 
coffeepot and meditates, alone, for an hour or so. On Sunday morning City Hall, 
on many occasions here the epicenter of shattering tumult, is as peaceful as a 
shrine. 
</P>
<P>
The upheaval that rocked Selma a generation ago changed the political landscape 
of the South and rippled across the nation. It is where black Americans, 
systematically disenfranchised, won the right to vote freely, to have a say in 
their own governance. From that day until this, Joe Smitherman has been mayor 
of Selma, surviving all the predictable aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
With coffee mug in hand and feet on his desk, Smitherman was saying he intends 
to leave office when his current four-year term -- his seventh -- expires in 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
Selmians (as they call themselves) have heard that tune before. In 1979, after 
15 years in office, a tired Joe Smitherman stepped aside for a year and passed 
the gavel to the president of the City Council. When the next election came 
around, Smitherman was back in the race. He has never lost an election. This 
time, though, Selmians are betting that the heart attack may influence the 
mayor's resolve, and some wonder what is to become of Selma after "the 
Smitherman reign," as one recent history book calls it. 
</P>
<P>
"Selma will do just fine," Smitherman said. "It will have to, because it's time 
for me to go. I've walked this tightrope long enough, and I'm getting tired. Do 
you know how wearing this job can be?" 
</P>
<P>
Wearing, yes. According to a researcher at the U.S. Conference of Mayors, it is 
rare for anyone to last as mayor of a city for 25 years. The figures would 
include complacent towns where nothing much happens to cause anything to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
And this storied town on the blood-red banks of the Alabama River surely is not 
one of those. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happens in Selma, good or bad, has for the last 25 years been viewed 
against the backdrop of its past. Visitors still drop by daily to see the city 
that became a symbol, its very name a curse, a rallying cry for passage of the 
Voting Rights Act back in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
The old conjure women on the river bank used to whisper the legend that stars 
once fell on Alabama, a powerful sign that the land was cursed. Some in Selma 
find reason to believe it. 
</P>
<P>
A historical marker outside City Hall commemorates the two pivotal events, 100 
years apart, that have marked Selma for all time. 
</P>
<P>
One side marks the day in 1865 when Yankee soldiers sacked the town and burned 
its Confederate arsenal. The other side commemorates "Bloody Sunday," that day 
in 1965 when troopers and mounted deputies whipped and tear-gassed blacks 
demonstrating against the blatant scheme that had denied them the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
That event, and the 10 weeks of angry protests leading up to it, occurred the 
year after Joe Smitherman took office. It fell to him to preside over what 
could be called Selma's second Reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
Selma, then and now, is a city of about 27,000 people, about 52% of whom are 
black. The differences between then and now, however, are striking. 
</P>
<P>
The Selma in which Smitherman grew up was a cotton town ravaged by the boll 
weevil and the Depression. He was born in 1929, the youngest of six children. 
His widowed mother died when he was 11 and he was reared in a shotgun house on 
a dirt street in East Selma -- on the wrong side of the tracks, where scrawny 
chickens scratched around outhouses. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Selma was so rigidly segregated that even the fishing ponds, side by 
side, were designated "colored" and "white." To Smitherman it was an 
unquestioned way of life, as normal as waiting in line on Water Avenue to get 
government surplus food on Saturdays. Those lines, though, included both blacks 
and whites. 
</P>
<P>
"In retrospect," said Smitherman, "especially after I took office, I knew good 
and well we were wrong. If I were black, I would have agitated too. And if I 
couldn't vote, I'd have been an activist probably more extreme than some who 
came here." 
</P>
<P>
And Selma today? The mayor likes to take visitors on his personal tour. What 
they see at first glance could serve as a model of civic progress and racial 
harmony. Side by side, blacks and whites work, live, shop, worship, vote, serve 
on the City Council and the school board and patrol in police cars. 
</P>
<P>
Today's generation of Selma blacks takes integration for granted. To them 
Bloody Sunday was something long ago, something they learned about during Black 
History Month, like slavery. 
</P>
<P>
But Selma still feels the ache of what has become a nationwide migraine reduced 
to a one-syllable word: race. 
</P>
<P>
Blacks eligible to vote in Selma's Dallas County now barely outnumber whites. 
Under Smitherman, Selma has gerrymandered its wards so that four blacks and 
four whites sit on the City Council. The council president, elected at large, 
currently is a white member. Council members have an unwritten agreement that 
should any one of them leave office in midterm, the replacement will be a 
person of the same race. 
</P>
<P>
Very often in Selma, seemingly neutral issues that come before the council are 
resolved along racial lines. The city's heritage of confrontation seems to have 
left it as fragile as a house of cards: The whole town hopes no one will bump 
the table. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, Smitherman has managed to keep the balance, to walk the tightrope, as 
he says, without losing control. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe Smitherman is a man of great cunning," the Rev. Fred Reese said. "He knows 
how to manipulate the white people to accept changes that will benefit the 
black people -- and them, too, really. He knows just how far to go and still 
keep white support without losing black support." 
</P>
<P>
Reese, a black man, is the principal of Selma High School. Back in 1964, he 
headed the Dallas County Voter's League. He was the one who lured Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. to Selma for the voting rights crusade. Reese was one of the 
few blacks who managed to register to vote despite the obstacles of the time. 
In the 1964 mayoral election, he voted for Smitherman. 
</P>
<P>
"Joe and I are the same age. We grew up in the same part of town in similar 
circumstances," Reese said. "Blacks can identify with him." 
</P>
<P>
For the 30 years before Smitherman ran for mayor, there hadn't been a real 
election. The elite of Selma passed the office from one of their number to the 
next, like a fiefdom. The only requirement was to keep things as they were. 
</P>
<P>
Smitherman, then, was a brash upstart. He was a gawky young appliance salesman 
with a long neck and big ears and no friends at the country club. He managed to 
get elected to the City Council, where he became a royal pain. He wanted the 
city to conduct its business in the open, for example, instead of in the back 
room. Brash. 
</P>
<P>
He ran for mayor pledging to represent "all the people, not the favored few," 
and the word all was underscored on his campaign fliers. 
</P>
<P>
"I figured everybody had a favored few they didn't like," he said. "I was 
right. When I won, the Old Guard wouldn't even give me a key to City Hall. I 
had to get one made." 
</P>
<P>
After the civil rights demonstrations, Smitherman became the busiest man in 
town. He pushed through a penny sales tax and did things that people could see 
and touch -- paved and lighted streets, new garbage trucks, fire engines, sewer 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
He became an expert at wheedling money out of Washington, money the Old Guard 
had shunned as "tainted," as inviting federal interference in local affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"Only thing tainted about it is t'aint enough of it!" Smitherman told them. 
</P>
<P>
Still more visible, touchable changes happened, each new project overlapping 
the last -- new libraries, a new City Hall, housing projects, schools, museums, 
fountains, trees and flowers and parks. 
</P>
<P>
Railroad crossings were hazardous, so Smitherman stopped a 180-car freight with 
a police car and ticketed the conductor for blocking the streets. The railroad 
rescheduled the run. 
</P>
<P>
He refused to pay the city's electric bill until the power company explained 
its "pass-on charges" so that customers could know what they were paying for. 
</P>
<P>
When Ku Klux Klan members showed up on the City Hall steps, he called them 
"white trash" and ran them out of town. Blacks applauded. He padlocked the 
anti-poverty office because only 5% of its paid employees were white -- not 
enough. Whites applauded. 
</P>
<P>
At the 20th anniversary of Bloody Sunday, Smitherman went to the pulpit of 
Brown Chapel, where King had preached, and said: "My hands are as dirty as the 
others'. We were wrong. I'm sorry." He shared a hymnal with Jesse Jackson and 
sang "We Shall Overcome." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose I've been the most visible person in the state, short of the 
governor," Smitherman said, "and a lot of people expected me to run for higher 
office. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was younger I gave some thought to it, but after a few terms, I 
discovered it's hard for mayors to do that. 
</P>
<P>
"Mayors can't duck issues or avoid taking sides. For mayors, the public is as 
close as the sidewalk. You either get the garbage picked up or you don't. You 
either remove the dangerous tree or you don't. You can't tell an angry citizen 
that you'll have a committee look into it, not if you want to get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, you need what I call the Big Mules, the money boys who finance your 
campaign and don't let you forget where you got the money. I've shifted around 
so much politically -- backing Democrats, Republicans, whatever -- that the Big 
Mules who know me could never be sure if I'd stay hitched. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, Selma is all I really care about, and being mayor of Selma has been 
sufficient. Two more years and I'm history."

When hog farmer Martin (Bubs) Hohulin told voters he would give away part of 
his legislative salary if they elected him to the Missouri House, he was trying 
to show he thought state lawmakers are overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Hohulin did win, and now that promise has put the Republican rookie into an 
unexpected legal jam. 
</P>
<P>
"Back when I was a teen-ager, I did some things I probably should have gotten 
in trouble for, and now I get into trouble for something like this. It's wild," 
said Hohulin, 26. 
</P>
<P>
The snag: State law prohibits candidates from promising a part of their salary 
to any public or private interest. 
</P>
<P>
Hohulin promised to donate $2,800 of the $22,863 annual House salary for 
college scholarships to eight high school students in the district. 
</P>
<P>
"It was my way of showing that I was against lawmakers voting to raise their 
pay," said Hohulin, who hails from Lamar, the birthplace of Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats raised the issue of the promise during the campaign and then filed a 
complaint after Hohulin defeated Democratic Rep. Jerry Burch, a 12-year 
incumbent, 5,051 votes to 4,500. The Missouri attorney general's office is 
looking into whether the promise violated the law. 
</P>
<P>
"If we find there is a violation of the law, then we will prosecute," said 
spokeswoman Mary Jenkins, whose boss, Atty. Gen. William Webster, is a 
Republican. 
</P>
<P>
She said the infraction would be a misdemeanor with a maximum penalty of one 
year in jail and a $2,500 fine, but no forfeiture of office. State election 
officials said they didn't recall a similar case. 
</P>
<P>
"I honestly in my heart thought I was trying to do something good for the 
people in my community. Anybody who knows me knows I'm not a dishonest person," 
Hohulin said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would make good his promise, Hohulin said he was waiting to see 
what the attorney general's office decided. 
</P>
<P>
"If I did something wrong, I'm sorry, but I don't know all the laws. I'm a 
farmer, not a lawyer," said Hohulin. 
</P>
<P>
Democrats said they aren't swayed by Hohulin's remorse. 
</P>
<P>
"Campaigns shouldn't be run on a bidding basis, saying you'll take less money 
than your opponent," said state Democratic Chairman Gene Bushmann said. "If 
we've got the law on the books, then we ought to enforce it." 
</P>
<P>
Few people in the district abutting the Missouri-Kansas border seem to view 
Hohulin's promise as the key to his victory. 
</P>
<P>
They attribute Burch's defeat to an anti-incumbency attitude and a feeling by 
some that he was more interested in statewide matters than local problems. 
</P>
<P>
Burch, who had a good shot at becoming House majority leader next year, voted 
to spend state money to build a St. Louis sports stadium and to repair sports 
complexes in Kansas City -- an unpopular idea in the conservative farming 
district. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is upset over government spending too much money. People were really 
infuriated over the stadium bill," said Doug Davis, publisher of the weekly 
Lamar Democrat. "They felt Jerry sold them out and they felt they were going to 
have to pay taxes for the benefit of Kansas City and St. Louis."

TURTLES COME THUNDERING BACK AFTER MEXICO BANS BUTCHERY OF THEM;

<TEXT>
<P>
Hosts of olive ridley turtles crawl from the pounding surf, in a season more 
peaceful than the last, to lay their eggs on a beach that stretches to the 
horizon. 
</P>
<P>
Olive ridleys were butchered by the tens of thousands a year ago, but in May 
the government forbade the killing. 
</P>
<P>
Fishing boats no longer prowl the waters off the main nesting beach. The 
slaughterhouse 12 miles away is silent and abandoned, its roof collapsed inside 
the concrete-block walls. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the danger is gone, however. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists working out of a nearby camp still race egg thieves to the nests. 
Authorities recently confiscated 944 skins, representing half as many dead 
turtles, in a village up the coast known in the past for clandestine slaughter. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen who lived by killing sea turtles have few alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
Those in the cooperative at San Agustinillo, where the slaughterhouse sits 
derelict, were well off last season. Now they wonder how to feed their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"We all know the ecologists have money to take food home every day without any 
problem, and they've put us on a diet," Silverio Alvarez said of the pressure 
to stop the killing of sea turtles. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, there are more turtles this year -- in part because of the ban 
and in part, it seems, because it is just a good year for turtles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I could definitely say the death toll has decreased," said Georgita 
Ruiz, a veterinarian who has studied turtles for 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
"There are more turtles nesting on the beach than in previous years. They have 
natural surges in nesting activity, but I think it's logical that if there 
isn't as much disturbance where they're going to nest, you're going to see 
more." 
</P>
<P>
She added, however: "People are still people and they're still hungry. They're 
going to beg, borrow, steal or kill to get what they need." 
</P>
<P>
Ruiz runs the Pronatura conservation organization's turtle program at 
Escobilla, 300 miles southeast of Mexico City on the Pacific Coast of Oaxaca 
state. 
</P>
<P>
Elpidio Marcelino Lopez said the 10 to 15 boats he saw capturing turtles 200 
yards off the beach last year aren't there this season. Marcelino is a 
biologist from Oaxaca State University who has spent several seasons at the 
Escobilla camp. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists say some killing continues despite the ban decreed by 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
"We know there are two clandestine slaughterhouses," said Homero Aridjis, 
president of the Group of 100, an environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
He said they were discovered on secondary nesting beaches, one of which also is 
used by leatherback turtles. Aridjis said there was no indication of how many 
turtles were being processed there. 
</P>
<P>
Biologists move the eggs from nests on the beach to nursery areas at the camp. 
</P>
<P>
"If we had 200 nests, they'd steal 201," Marcelino said of the egg thieves. 
</P>
<P>
Mexico was the world's leading killer of sea turtles and Japan its biggest 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
The victims generally were olive ridleys, the most numerous of the seven 
species of sea turtles. Six of the seven species are found in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
What makes olive ridleys special are their arribadas, mass nestings that occur 
about once a month from July to December. Biologists estimate that 75,000 
nested on 1 1/2 miles of the Escobilla beach during the October arribada, more 
than in all of 1988 and more than half the 1989 total. 
</P>
<P>
Marcelino also said more are nesting between arribadas this year. 
</P>
<P>
Pairs of turtle tracks make stripes on the beach, one from the water, the other 
returning, their edges scrolled like ocean waves. The tracks going up the beach 
are a bit deeper, because of the 10 pounds of eggs in a 100-pound turtle. 
</P>
<P>
If there is only one track, a turtle is at the end of it. Her back flippers, 
curled like hands, scoop out a hole where she lays 100 or so eggs the size of 
golf balls. Then she fills the hole, tamping down the sand, and heads back to 
the sea. 
</P>
<P>
Olive ridleys have nine other major nesting beaches worldwide, but the level of 
killing wiped out the two or three other major sites in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
"There was no reason to think Oaxaca wouldn't go the same way," Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated 70,000 turtles were killed in 1989. The legal limit, divided among 
licensed cooperatives, was 23,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to forbidding the olive ridley kill, the presidential decree 
increased the government commitment to enforce bans on killing other turtle 
species and the taking and selling of eggs, shells, skins and other products. 
It also supports research. 
</P>
<P>
In San Agustinillo, there were two things to do: capture turtles or work at the 
slaughterhouse. Both stopped at the end of May. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes we borrow money, or you don't eat beans, you eat tortillas, just to 
buy school supplies for the children," said Alvarez, the idle fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
He said he had earned about $140 from turtles during peak months, as much in 
five days as fish brought the rest of the month. With their minds on nesting, 
turtles are easy to grab. 
</P>
<P>
Shark fishing, a likely alternative, means going so far to sea you can lose 
sight of land, he said, more fuel and maintenance for the boat and, without a 
radio, more danger. 
</P>
<P>
New boats, motors, trucks and nets that the government fishing department gave 
cooperatives do not make up for the loss, Alvarez said. 
</P>
<P>
Fishermen contend that there are plenty of turtles. Those outside cooperatives 
are blamed for much of the illegal killing, before the ban and now. 
</P>
<P>
"Even with all the vigilance we have, the nesting beaches are very extensive," 
said Myrna Wong of the fishing department. "You can't cover all of it at the 
same time." 
</P>
<P>
Todd Steiner, director of the sea turtle project of Earth Island Institute, 
agreed that the ban had been effective, but also said: "I think if the 
international environmental community goes to sleep, all the turtles will get 
is a temporary reprieve." 
</P>
<P>
On a busy Saturday in Mexico City's Tepito market, famous for contraband, four 
vendors hawked turtle eggs, a delicacy, at three for the equivalent of $1.70. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses were required to register their turtle products after the decree, 
but there was no deadline on selling nonperishable products. That makes tracing 
new stock, an indication of poaching, more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have confiscated large amounts of tortoise shell, a product of the 
hawksbill turtle, but Homero Aridjis, president of the Group of 100 
environmental organization, said it still is available in stores. 
</P>
<P>
Two men selling part-turtle boots were certain they wouldn't run out. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always clandestine trade," Hector Guevara said, making a gesture under 
the table.

AVON LADY CALLING, THIS TIME IN CHINA

<P>
Avon is calling, Chinese-style. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of knocking on doors in the American tradition to sell beauty supplies, 
Avon salespeople in China will use the time-hallowed Chinese custom of working 
through personal contacts. 
</P>
<P>
The first selling job Avon faced in China was with Chinese officials, said John 
Novosad, vice president for the Asia-Pacific region of Avon Products Inc. 
</P>
<P>
"The first thing we heard was, 'What's direct selling?' " Novosad in a 
telephone interview from his Hong Kong office. "They had great difficulty 
understanding why we thought this was a good idea." 
</P>
<P>
Avon in a joint venture with the Guangzhou Cosmetics Factory began selling 
beauty products in November in the southern city of Guangzhou, also known as 
Canton. The company has 25 supervisors, all Chinese, who have recruited about 
800 people to sell beauty supplies on a commission basis, Novosad said. 
</P>
<P>
"We expected to have to spend a lot of time teaching these people about profit 
incentive and the selling methods," Novosad said. "You're talking about a 
country that we all believe doesn't know about these things. Well, it wasn't 
that way. The first question we heard was, 'How much commission do I get?' " 
</P>
<P>
Avon, which already sells its products in more than 100 countries, is selling 
skin-care supplies, perfumes, cosmetics and personal hygiene items in China. 
They will be made in China with imported ingredients. 
</P>
<P>
The company's traditional image in the United States is of an "Avon lady" 
ringing doorbells and spending leisurely afternoons with her customers. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, we're telling the representatives to build networks, talk to their 
sisters, talk to those they work with and so on. There are no limits, so it can 
be done door-to-door if they feel comfortable, or it can be done by taking 
brochures to work. It depends on the ingenuity." 
</P>
<P>
Novosad said Avon will test the method in Guangzhou before trying other parts 
of China, which has a population of about 1.1 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
Avon supervisors receive a base salary, but also get a 2% to 6% commission on 
the sales of the representatives they recruit, Novosad said. The salespeople 
will receive a 25% commission on their sales, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We think it will work here and let us develop a base for all of China. China, 
once it gets economically going, will be a fabulous market of tremendous 
proportions," Novosad said. "We don't expect to make millions at first." 
</P>
<P>
Prices for Avon products sold in Guangzhou average about $3. That's one-tenth 
the average monthly income of a Chinese worker, but Guangzhou workers are 
generally better off than those elsewhere in the country. Customers are most 
likely to be single young women, who tend to have relatively high disposable 
incomes.

KANSAS CITY JAZZ TRADITION HITS SOUR NOTE; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: KANSAS CITY ONCE WAS KNOWN FOR NIGHTCLUBS FEATURING THE LIKES OF COUNT 
BASIE AND CHARLIE PARKER. TODAY, MUSICIANS ARE STRUGGLING.

KANSAS CITY, Mo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Little Willie Littlefield wrote the popular tune "Goin' to Kansas City" in 
the early 1900s, jazz musicians flocked here for the the good life and plenty 
of gigs. 
</P>
<P>
Nightclubs lined the streets and the joints were jumping from early evening to 
early morning seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
Today, hundreds of jazz musicians and half a dozen jazz organizations are 
struggling to keep Kansas City's jazz tradition alive. About 400 jazz and blues 
soloists and more than 70 bands are competing for a shrinking share of the 
economic pie. 
</P>
<P>
The money coming in from the city, corporations and the public isn't enough to 
sustain a healthy jazz community in Kansas City, most musicians say. 
</P>
<P>
"The city has a certain amount of money, and the jazz groups are fighting over 
it. They're biting and clawing for money," says Stan Kessler, 36, a Kansas City 
trumpet player who works part-time at a health food store. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Alpert, director of the Kansas City Jazz Commission, which coordinates and 
finances jazz events and projects, says, "There's just not enough money. We've 
like turned water into wine in the last year." 
</P>
<P>
In a good year, the commission will receive about $40,000 from the city, Alpert 
says. In an off year, that may dip to about $10,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, the city's three major commercial jazz organizations -- the Jazz 
Festival Committee, The 18th and Vine Heritage Festival and the Jazz 
Ambassadors -- all agreed to unite under the commission. 
</P>
<P>
The more coordinated the groups are, the more likely corporations and the city 
will financially support jazz, Alpert says. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, it's really easy to let your cultural amenities go by the 
wayside in hard times," he says. "But culture is a vital cog to the economic 
growth of the city." 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Jackson, 70, a reed player who still tries to play as many gigs as he 
can, remembers the good old days. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a happy time," he says. "The musicians would play from 9 at night to 5 
in the morning." 
</P>
<P>
The boom years for Kansas City and jazz started in the late 1920s, when Kansas 
City had as many as 100 nightclubs and cabarets. In the small 18th and Vine 
jazz district alone, there were more than 60 jazz clubs. 
</P>
<P>
The permissive political climate under political boss Tom Pendergast allowed 
Kansas City to become a citadel of jazz in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
"If you want to see some sin forget about Paris and go to Kansas City," 
columnist Edward Morrow wrote in the Omaha World-Herald at the time. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the 1929 stock market crash, Kansas City's night life carried on, and 
employment for musicians reached its highest levels. It was then that the 
Kansas City jazz style blossomed. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's jazz style has its foundations in blues, ragtime and folk music 
and was developed through a combination of the swing era dance beats. The jam 
session was and still is a very important part of Kansas City jazz. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's bands managed to stay together in the early 1930s when theaters 
and nightclubs were folding nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
A saxophone player named Charlie Parker began his ascent to fame here in his 
hometown in the '30s. Count Basie was a regular in the clubs here. 
</P>
<P>
But with the end of Pendergast's political career in 1938, after his indictment 
on tax evasion charges, came the end of the jazz heyday. 
</P>
<P>
Reform elements took over, nightclubs and cabarets were shut down, jobs for 
musicians dried up and the Kansas City bands took to the road.

<P>
Catch the wave of expectation cresting through San Diego's civic elite these 
days: One of their own has been elected the 36th governor of California, and 
now they want some respect. 
</P>
<P>
With a former mayor, Pete Wilson, set to be inaugurated Jan. 7, city leaders 
say San Diego has never been in a better position to shed its reputation as 
California's cultural cul-de-sac and assume its rightful prestige as the 
second-largest city in the state. 
</P>
<P>
They're tired of living down the image of a sleepy Navy town and 
one-dimensional vacation spot, where sailors, surfers and blue-haired retirees 
exist quietly in the shadow of brawny Los Angeles. They're tired of getting 
left out by the power brokers in Sacramento when it comes time to divvy up 
state funding for social programs and hand out the political plums. 
</P>
<P>
Now they're banking on favorite son Wilson, surrounded by his coterie of 
hometown advisers, to usher in a new era when San Diego no longer will be 
considered the shy stepsister of California government. "He (Wilson) really did 
a lot to put San Diego on the public map . . . and I think San Diego will 
benefit from it," said Robert C. Fellmeth, a law professor and director of the 
University of San Diego's Center for Public Interest Law. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that, at least before this election or Pete Wilson's rise, people in 
California and Sacramento thought the state stopped somewhere south of 
Disneyland, but they weren't exactly sure," he said. "I think they now know 
there's a little bulb of land down here, growing like a weed, called San 
Diego." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Grissom, president of the Greater San Diego Chamber of Commerce, added: 
</P>
<P>
"This is really a very special opportunity for San Diego to exercise its 
political vision and exercise its political connections. If there is something 
that San Diego needs, like additional financial support for the county, this is 
literally a once-in-a-lifetime chance -- actually, a once in a 200-year-time -- 
to achieve it." 
</P>
<P>
Fueling the enthusiasm is the hope that Wilson, like Deukmejian before him, 
will reward his most trusted supporters with appointments to influential state 
boards and commissions -- jobs that set the tone for state regulation and 
planning. Some of the more prestigious posts include the UC Board of Regents, 
the CSU Board of Trustees, the Public Utilities Commission, the California 
Transportation Commission and the California Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian drew upon supporters from hometown Long Beach and Armenians in 
Fresno to help stock these and myriad other boards. 
</P>
<P>
He appointed his former law partner to the state Supreme Court; his 
brother-in-law to the Del Mar fair board; his barber to the Board of Barber 
Examiners; his local sporting goods retailer to the Fish and Game Commission; 
his minister to the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners, and his neighbor 
across the street to the California Medical Assistance Commission. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans expect no less from Wilson, who tagged his hometown with the slogan 
"America's Finest City." Their optimism is undimmed by his first four cabinet 
picks, all of whom hail from elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson spokesman Otto Bos tried last week to temper such talk. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be careful what you draw from all this," Bos said, adding that 
Wilson has spent the last eight years as U.S. senator and has an extensive 
network of supporters throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, even with that caveat, Bos acknowledged that the Wilson camp has nurtured 
the hopes by underscoring the former mayor's ties with San Diego. A former San 
Diego Union reporter, Bos observed that Wilson's election marked a political 
"coming of age" for the city. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the days when . . . consultants used to give this kind of advice if 
you were a candidate, you were from San Diego and you wanted to run for 
statewide office: 'Move!' " Bos said. 
</P>
<P>
Repeated television ads during the campaign held the city up as a shining 
example of Wilson's managerial abilities. Candidate Wilson insisted on 
operating his campaign out of San Diego offices, even though Los Angeles would 
have been more convenient politically and for travel. His campaign symbol was a 
surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
Now that he's elected, Wilson's inaugural plans include trucking up food from 
the popular El Indio restaurant for a special San Diego-styled "fiesta" to kick 
off the festivities in Sacramento on Jan. 5. Planeloads of prominent locals -- 
including the San Diego Chicken, in tux -- will attend. Then, a triumphant 
Wilson will return after the inauguration to a hometown reception Jan. 11 to 
the San Diego Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wilson has decided to open a San Diego gubernatorial office. And his 
aides are said to be working behind the scenes to persuade Republican National 
Committee officials to hold their 1992 presidential convention in San Diego -- 
a publicity coup that would rival the city's successful bid to host the 1988 
Super Bowl. Nothing like this has happened since local boy Dennis Conner lost 
and then won back the America's Cup yachting trophy from Australia. 
</P>
<P>
All the attention has done wonders to assuage the wounded pride of a place with 
a reputation as the backwater of California politics. 
</P>
<P>
"If you went down to the tip of California, it (San Diego) was a pleasant place 
with nice climate -- but kind of a non-entity," said A. Alan Post, legislative 
analyst from 1949 to 1977. "It took care of itself, and it was a Navy town. As 
a matter of fact, the city didn't feature in any large way in state politics." 
</P>
<P>
Before Wilson, the highest statewide officeholder hailing from San Diego was 
Bert A. Betts, treasurer between 1959 and 1967. In fact, Wilson is the only San 
Diegan ever elected to the U.S. Senate since California was admitted to the 
Union in 1850. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the reason for San Diego's weak showing over the years has been sheer 
numbers: It is difficult to make a mark in the Legislature or statewide 
politics when you're dwarfed by colossus Los Angeles and more sophisticated San 
Francisco, say Capitol old-timers. 
</P>
<P>
In the 120-member Legislature, Los Angeles County owns 52 seats and the San 
Francisco Bay Area has 21. San Diego lags behind with 11 in the Assembly and 
Senate. The impending redistricting should take San Diego's recent growth into 
account and narrow the gap, but it still will be unable to match Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Even with that disadvantage, San Diego over the years could have overcome its 
political isolation if its legislators weren't so busy building the reputation 
as one of the most provincial -- and weirdest -- delegations around, said 
former State Sen. James R. Mills. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego was thought to send some strange people to Sacramento," said Mills, 
who as powerful Senate President Pro Tempore during the 1970s, counted himself 
an exception. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Frank Luckel, a retired naval officer who represented parts of San 
Diego from 1948 to 1962, took delight in confusing colleagues by uttering 
speeches that were "intentionally unintelligible," Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Schrade, an inveterate prankster who served in the Assembly from 1955 to 
1962, once conned a legion of lobbyists into using his "secret" Oriental 
aphrodisiac, which he dispensed in small bottles. The potion turned out to be a 
harmless dye, which horrified the lobbyists by turning their urine the color of 
blood, Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
The antics underscored the fact that most local legislators showed no interest 
in meaningful legislation, and were suspicious of the insider game of power 
politics, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was easy to take advantage of San Diego because San Diego was such a 
political island," said Mills, now chairman of the Metropolitan Transit 
Development Board. "It's out of the mainstream, therefore the people writing 
legislation could treat it lightly." 
</P>
<P>
That kind of benign neglect has dogged the county even through the go-go '80s, 
when its population surged nearly 32% -- from 1.9 million to 2.5 million 
residents. While the county was becoming the second-largest in California, many 
people still didn't allow for it in their psychological map, said Sen. Lucy 
Killea (D-San Diego). 
</P>
<P>
Killea tells the story about the time she attended a conference on Southern 
California tourism shortly after being elected to the Assembly in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
"I spoke up and said, 'It's not that way in San Diego,' " Killea recalled about 
a discussion involving transportation issues. "Somebody said, 'Oh, we're not 
talking about San Diego. We're talking about Southern California.' " 
</P>
<P>
But the ultimate hurdle in San Diego's quest for statewide respect is the most 
ironic. The region's carefully cultivated image as a laid-back beach paradise 
is undermining its ambitions in Sacramento, say Killea and others. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau will spend $2 million 
in tax money to entice tourists with glossy magazine photos of sailboats lining 
a sun-drenched bay. "Just Another Beautiful Day in San Diego," say the ads, 
which boast of its 70 miles of beaches and proximity to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
While the ads are aimed at the working stiff chattering through the Cleveland 
winter, they also hit home in Sacramento, where appearance is sometimes more 
important than reality. Legislators, staff members and lobbyists believe the 
San Diego image so much, they find it hard to believe that the region has 
outgrown its own hype. 
</P>
<P>
"They cannot understand that we have gang problems, drug problems and jail 
overcrowding problems," said Kathryn C. Rees, Sacramento lobbyist for the city 
of San Diego. "They can only think of San Diego as the sunny, sleepy town along 
the border, in the shadow of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
"People are very surprised to become alerted to the fact that San Diego is the 
second-largest city," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Case in point is Rees herself, who confessed that she didn't know the dark side 
of paradise before being hired by the city more than three years ago. "I had 
been there for conventions and meetings and seen little other than the beaches 
and the hotels," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Forsyth, spokesman for Senate President Pro Tempore David A. Roberti 
(D-Los Angeles), said: "The beltway in Sacramento is no different than other 
places in the United States when the words 'San Diego' come up -- you think of 
an incredibly pleasant place to be, to work, to live. Maybe we suffer from a 
Chamber of Commerce myopia." 
</P>
<P>
Myopia to some has been diagnosed as blindness by San Diegans, who have begun 
to grumble loudly about their stepchild treatment in the state Capitol. They 
complain that they can't interest enough people in their welter of urban ills, 
some of them formidable. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego jails, for instance, are some of the most overcrowded in the nation, 
according to a law enforcement survey for the first half of 1990. The San Diego 
lock-up held 84% more inmates than its approved capacity, trailing only Phoenix 
at 85% overcapacity. Los Angeles held only 37% more than its designed capacity 
and San Francisco 6%, the statistics showed. 
</P>
<P>
An increase in the cases of abused children also has social workers scrambling. 
Department of Social Services figures show it admitted 584 abused children in 
October to the Hillcrest Receiving Home, a 26-year-old facility that was built 
to hold only 16 at a time. 
</P>
<P>
At the border, illegal immigrants stream in from Mexico, taking up residence in 
North County encampments. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials also lament state funding formulas that deliver 
mental health grants at a rate 27.6% below the average for California. Other 
restrictions keep the revenue-starved county collecting such a small share of 
the local property tax that its general fund average of $189 per resident ranks 
a lowly 56th out of 58 counties. The state average was $260 per capita, with 
Los Angeles County collecting nearly $300 per resident in property taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Fed up with Sacramento's inattention, San Diego officials have filed three 
suits against state government since 1986 to receive more money. One was 
settled, giving the county an extra $13.7 million a year for drug and alcohol 
treatment. The others are pending. 
</P>
<P>
The Deukmejian Administration was slow to offer state help with the chronic 
sewage problem, and its diplomatic differences with San Diego Mayor Maureen 
O'Connor, a mercurial Democrat, scuttled any hope of money to help build 
crucial jail space. 
</P>
<P>
Assemblyman Steve Peace (D-Rancho San Diego) said he believes San Diego has 
made up for these oversights in other ways. Despite the sagging social 
programs, the region has collected more than its fair share in transportation 
dollars to build the trolley and its highway system, he said. Recent figures 
also show that San Diego has been blessed with a healthy cut of state money for 
local parks. 
</P>
<P>
Peace also cautioned against San Diegans demanding too much from Wilson, 
especially since he must now wrestle with a projected $6-billion budget 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
"I think some of the expectations are unfair to the governor-elect, in the 
sense that he's going to be dealing with limited resources," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But such sobering warnings have done little to dampen the hopes of Wilson's 
fellow San Diegans, who can hardly conceal their joy that a former mayor is 
finally going to take over the governor's suite. 
</P>
<P>
They are looking to him to even the score on state funding, as well as pay 
attention to peculiar San Diego problems long ignored by the state -- problems 
such as the rogue sewage that washes over from Tijuana and onto local beaches. 
</P>
<P>
"The chances of San Diego getting its fair share has probably improved by the 
fact that you have a San Diegan sitting here at probably the most powerful job 
in the state," conceded Wilson spokesman Bos. "It's got to help. When (County 
Supervisor) Susan Golding or Brian Bilbray comes in, they know they can get in 
the door, bend his ear and get a sympathetic ear as well." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, there's simply the idea that San Diego can now, in political 
terms, step out of the shadows of Los Angeles and San Francisco, said Sen. 
William A. Craven (R-Oceanside). Wilson's election marks the passage of a 
one-time Navy town into the ranks of a major city that commands attention, if 
not respect, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Moondoggie has grown up, and he has traded his swimming trunks for a business 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe that's the most important thing," said Craven, a 17-year veteran of the 
Legislature. "If San Diego can produce a governor, people will have to stand up 
and take notice more than they have in the past . . . of an area that has 
emerged with political clout."

DANA PARSONS: CASE MAY SHOW HOMELESS GET SHORT END OF NIGHTSTICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cops are an interesting breed of cat. The best ones are wonderful combinations 
of brains, guts, insight and a visceral desire to help other people. You can 
have some enlightening conversations talking with cops about the human 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
Other cops, however, can give you the shivers. Their personal foibles may be no 
lesser or greater than yours or mine, but we don't get to carry nightsticks and 
guns. So, when we see something or someone on the street we don't like, our 
options are severely limited. 
</P>
<P>
Not so for the street cop. He has a whole range of exciting possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
I had the unpleasant experience of sitting at home the other night and watching 
a short videotape that showed four uniformed Laguna Beach police officers 
standing over a man. The video, shot in June by an unidentified person, shows 
one of the four officers delivering a few kicks before a fellow officer extends 
his arm, seemingly to stop the attack. You don't see who's being kicked because 
he's on the ground, but momentarily a shirtless man with a bloodied face is 
raised to his feet. The man, Kevin Dunbar, has conceded that he was drunk at 
the time of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
As in most cases when police are making an arrest, it's doubtful that Dunbar 
said: "Good evening, officers. How may I make your job easier?" 
</P>
<P>
So while it's possible that there's more here than meets the camera, it's 
difficult to imagine anything Dunbar could have done to warrant the assault 
caught on tape. Indeed, only one of the four officers -- the one doing the 
kicking -- seemed the least bent out of shape. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach Police Chief Neil Purcell had a surprisingly candid reaction. 
While noting that more investigating is necessary before all the facts are 
known, he said: "I understand that officers are only human. Sometimes they can 
lose it." 
</P>
<P>
The thought of a cop "losing it" when dealing with a defenseless drunk is -- if 
you'll pardon the pun -- sobering. What if the incident hadn't been videotaped? 
Would this have been another case where a suspect fell down on the curb and cut 
his face? 
</P>
<P>
So far, Chief Purcell seems to be making the right moves. At least in his 
public comments he's keeping an open mind as to what might have happened. In 
addition, the district attorney's office is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
That investigation should answer the question of whether the officer, Keith 
Knotek, mistreated Dunbar. 
</P>
<P>
But other questions need to be addressed. Dunbar was apparently well known to 
Laguna Beach police as a homeless person. And while Purcell has discounted any 
possibility that the incident is tied to Dunbar's social status, it's a 
question worth pursuing. 
</P>
<P>
Many people -- cops and citizens alike -- don't like the sight of the street 
people. They assault our senses and our sensitivities. Some of us want to help 
them; some of us want to run them out of town. 
</P>
<P>
This is no make-believe issue. The U.S. Conference of Mayors released a report 
last week citing "increased hostility to the homeless. . . . 80% of the cities 
reported that public sentiment toward the homeless is changing." 
</P>
<P>
That was a reference to the public at large. And yes, police officers are 
trained to handle people based on their behavior, not on their station in life. 
But they're also human beings. We remember how all too many of them reacted to 
"longhairs" of a generation ago. 
</P>
<P>
Public hostility toward the homeless can coexist with public efforts to help 
them. Just because Laguna Beach or Santa Ana or any other city is helping the 
homeless doesn't mean that its citizens or its police force may not have some 
members who harbor hostility toward them. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless issue is so real that California police officers and sheriff's 
deputies receive special training on it, according to Hal Snow, an official 
with the state commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been in groups with law enforcement officers who have discussed this," he 
said. "It almost places (an officer) in a situation where he has to be the 
mediator between the classes in our society. . . . Often, the haves want them 
out of sight, out of the city, out of the county. 
</P>
<P>
"Here in Sacramento, city police were requested to run the homeless out of our 
river area that's also a park. That's been a place for the homeless for years." 
</P>
<P>
Steven Brummer of the Bakersfield Police Department prepared a paper a couple 
of years ago for the Peace Officer Standards and Training state panel, 
regarding the projected effect of the homeless population on police agencies. A 
summary of that paper includes: "It was determined that, presently, law 
enforcement training on homeless issues is generally inadequate, and few 
enforcement programs are capable of managing the myriad of issues associated 
with the homeless population." 
</P>
<P>
The D.A.'s office and Laguna Beach police promise to fully investigate the 
alleged assault on Dunbar. It surely wouldn't hurt if they could reassure 
people that the incident had nothing to do with Dunbar's homeless status. 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, it might help the rest of Laguna's homeless sleep a little 
better at night.

ON TEACHING READING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sharp-eyed readers of Patrick Groff's Dec. 9 commentary probably gawked at the 
avalanche of misconceptions and inaccuracies contained in his warning to school 
boards about whole-language reading and writing instruction. 
</P>
<P>
Contrary to Groff, whole-language instruction is direct, systematic, intensive 
and formal. Whole-language instruction is the product of research that shows 
that instruction should cater to both sides of the brain, not just the logical 
left hemisphere. Skills-based, sequential reading instruction educates half a 
brain. 
</P>
<P>
Whole language does not "de-emphasize" word recognition; it merely eliminates 
insultingly simple, tedious drill-and-practice exercises, which make a 
significantly large number of kids hate reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
Yes, the whole-language approach encourages students to "omit, substitute and 
insert words in sentences they read," but it does not "encourage them to make 
eccentric decisions." Whole language is based upon the belief that our students 
are intelligent, sensitive human beings who are capable of decision-making and 
problem-solving tasks that are neither encouraged nor allowed by sequential, 
skills-based programs. Experimentation with language encourages students to 
experience reading comprehension as a creative, reconstructive process that 
empowers them as human beings who are in control of language, not manipulated 
by it. 
</P>
<P>
In terms of sequence, the whole-language approach demands higher expectations 
than mechanistic programs, which limit students by keeping them locked in the 
sequence even when they have demonstrated the ability to succeed at 
higher-level critical thinking skills. 
</P>
<P>
Proponents of whole language are enthusiastic because the approach gives us 
another tool, another way to make reading and writing instruction accessible 
and meaningful to students, especially those who may not succeed at 
traditional, sequential methods. 
</P>
<P>
A critical question for Groff should be: "Do you understand that there is more 
than one effective way to teach reading and writing?" 
</P>
<P>
One more point -- the most important component of educational effectiveness is 
not the program, the approach, or the materials. It's a good teacher.

REFLECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. Jeanette Avent, Times staff writer: When Mary Wagner, a former nurse and 
her husband, David, a college chemistry teacher retired, they hoped to turn 
their Christmas tree farm in Potrero from a weekend hobby into a fledgling 
business that would carry them through their golden years. Their plans for a 
life together ended abruptly when David suddenly died from an aneurysm in 1988, 
less than a year after they settled permanently in Potrero. Left with 20 acres 
and thousands of Monterey pines, Mary decided to see if she could manage the 
farm alone. Three Christmases later, Wagner, 57, is still distributing candy 
canes and smiles to the families who visit her farm 6 miles from Tecate. She 
was interviewed and photographed by Times staff writer G. Jeanette Avent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
David and I used to come down to San Diego from Ventura County on vacation. We 
were thinking of retiring down here and raising Christmas trees. We had a lemon 
tree ranch in Ventura, and we thought Christmas trees would be easy compared to 
lemons. We thought you just put them in the ground. 
</P>
<P>
We saw a "for sale" sign in Potrero. The property was 20 acres just outside the 
Potrero county park, and it had a well on it. We bought it and planted 2,000 
seedlings in 1982. Christmas tree farming had a lot of things going for it. Our 
children had grown up, our three sons, so this filled a void. It had all the 
components of child rearing -- all these little baby trees that needed to be 
weeded and watered. We joined the California Christmas Tree Growers Assn., and 
we'd go to the meetings together and learn how to parent Christmas trees. We 
came down on weekends, and it was a very satisfying hobby that we both enjoyed 
and shared. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas, 1984, we sold just a few trees but we really got under way in 1987. 
By then, we had nice, big, 3- and 4-year-old trees. It was a happy time for us. 
We made lots of friends in the Christmas Tree Growers Assn. and here at the 
tree farm. There were times we'd get very physically tired, but it was 
rewarding work. David had no farming background, not the slightest growing up. 
Actually I was the one who grew up on a farm. It was kind of a joke in the 
family that he married me because my father had a tractor. David always liked 
it though, and he looked like a farmer. 
</P>
<P>
David died May 9, 1988, while he was away on business in Ventura. He had an 
aneurysm in the coronary artery and he was gone very quickly. After he died, 
the thought was I'd just sell the tree farm and move back to Ventura County and 
go back into nursing. But I wanted to see if I could make a success of the tree 
farm on my own. 
</P>
<P>
It was very difficult. I knew what I wanted to do, but I didn't know how to do 
it. Fortunately, Jose had come to work for us two weeks before David died. We 
had hired him with the understanding it was a very temporary thing. We were 
going to build a house on the hill above the farm, and we decided we would need 
additional help so David could devote himself to the building of the house. Two 
weeks later Dave was gone, and Jose has been here ever since. Jose's experience 
before was as a bartender. But we've really gotten along well and worked hard. 
</P>
<P>
Last year we planted 5,000 seedlings, and we got extra help for that. They're 
individually hand-planted so if you consider the prospect of planting 5,000 
trees, it's considerble. After they're planted, we run an irrigation line along 
each tree and beside each tree is an emitter which emits one gallon of water an 
hour. I have three wells, one I had drilled in November, but we can only water 
so many trees at a time, because there isn't enough pump pressure. We water 
every day of the week, and, when the weather is hot, we water through the 
weekend. Right now we're irrigating each tree for about two hours a week. In 
the summer, we water up to five hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, we would water at night but the irrigation lines have to be checked to 
be sure they're working. There are constant problems. We have to walk the lines 
to be sure the emitters aren't clogged, or that a coyote hasn't chewed them, or 
that the ends haven't been untied. Children sometimes untie the ends, and the 
water runs right through. 
</P>
<P>
During the summer, we get up as soon as it's daylight because it gets so warm. 
In the morning, I get out among the trees and work till 11 or 12. The sun is 
just relentless on this mountain. During a heat spell, it can be in excess of 
110, but the temperature hovers around 100 most of the days, and then we have 
wonderfully cool nights. The work is endless. Watering and trimming and 
repairing drip lines. It just never stops. 
</P>
<P>
Then, beginning in November, we're open seven days a week from 8 a.m. to dusk. 
People often come out and tag the tree they want in November and then come back 
in December to pick it up. A lot of people from San Diego come out. The 
distance, about an hour's drive from San Diego, does not hamper people when 
they are looking for a tree. The purchase of a Christmas tree is emotional. 
People like to make it a tradition. My customers want me to know they come here 
year after year. They'll say, "This is our fourth year to get a tree here." 
It's easy to start friendships with my customers and their families. One year, 
the baby is small, the next year the baby is walking. I watch the children 
grow. At the high school age, they're no longer into coming out and walking 
endlessly down the rows looking for a tree. But, when they are overtaken with 
the urge to start building their own nest, they come back and say, "I think I'd 
like to have a tree for my own place." 
</P>
<P>
After Christmas, Jose and I do absolutely nothing through New Year's, and then 
we start replanting in January. I still think about how I ended up out here, 
but I'm not lonely. I miss David terribly, but there is a difference between 
loneliness and being alone. My children have been supportive, and I have a real 
need to see if I can make this work.

Two fires in San Diego caused a total of $85,000 in damages Saturday, left two 
adults and five children without a home and injured two senior citizens, fire 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A blaze at a home in the 1500 block of Klauber Avenue in Encanto began at 9:20 
a.m. when one of the five children living at the home was playing with matches 
and set a couch on fire, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire spread to a Christmas tree that was next to the couch, and then 
engulfed the whole house. 
</P>
<P>
Fire officials estimated damages in that blaze at $70,000. The family living at 
the house was taken in by the Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller fire at a Point Loma senior citizens complex began when a cigarette 
ignited a chair in a multipurpose room of the complex in the 1000 block of 
Scott Street, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which began at 10:43 a.m., caused $15,000 in damages. 
</P>
<P>
Two senior citizens who suffered smoke inhalation refused to be taken to the 
hospital, fire officials said.

Four men robbed a wholesale jewelry salesman in Linda Vista Friday night and 
made off with an estimated $500,000 in gold, rubies and diamonds, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Chau Minh Pham, 37, was walking to his car with two briefcases containing ruby 
necklaces, diamond rings and gold chains after having made a sales call in the 
6900 block of Linda Vista Road when four armed men drove up and robbed him, 
police spokesman Bill Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Pham, a jeweler from Garden Grove, estimated the value of the contents of the 
briefcases at $500,000, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four men had handguns and the fourth was armed with a rifle, 
Robinson said. The getaway car, a light blue Toyota, had been stolen from the 
Linda Vista area on Thursday and was found abandoned Saturday in the same area, 
Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
No shots were fired and no one was injured in the incident, Robinson said.

AIDS AND A COMMUNITY: THE IMPACT ON THE GAY LIFESTYLE IN LAGUNA BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Thank you for printing the article chronicling the lives of several gay men and 
their experience with AIDS. The article struck many of my emotions as I read 
the history of gay men's sexual conduct in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But the title of the article is a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
I am concerned that the article will leave in many the impression the majority 
of gay men still indulge in promiscuous unsafe sex as many of the interviewees 
with AIDS in Smith's article had. 
</P>
<P>
As a young gay man of 22, I would like to point out most of the subjects in 
this story are well over 30, and two of the most revealing quotes on homosexual 
conduct in Laguna Beach were by men ages 58 and 52. 
</P>
<P>
The article chronicles the impact of AIDS on an older generation, but not the 
entirety of Laguna Beach or of all gay men, as it may have been construed. 
While the older generation in this fine article deserves every bit of our care, 
compassion and love, their sexual conduct does not, I believe, represent the 
future of Laguna Beach: gay men in their 20s and younger. 
</P>
<P>
It is because of articles like this portraying the human sacrifices made of 
people with AIDS (and who have received little help from our government, thank 
you Ronald Reagan) that men my age practice safe sex. But while I am close 
enough in age to the generation hardest hit by AIDS to realize and learn from 
its devastation, younger men and women are not, and must be educated by our 
schools in a frank and honest manner about AIDS and safe sex.

<TEXT>
<P>
The article concerning Laguna Beach and AIDS was the worst piece of sensational 
journalism I have ever read. 
</P>
<P>
If the purpose of a feature article is to inform and educate, then you failed 
miserably. 
</P>
<P>
I am a person with AIDS and your article was an unfair representation of gay 
people in Laguna Beach. To highlight a man who killed himself, to focus on a 
sex workshop at Laguna Shanti, this is not what the gay community is about. 
This article could have been written by the Rev. Lou Sheldon. This article was 
not worthy of the Los Angeles Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
Your recent front page story on AIDS, Laguna Beach and gays came with 
unbelievable timing when you were reporting on the journalistic discrimination 
of racial minorities. Yet you print as "news" sensationalized recollections of 
long-ago wild parties given by Laguna gays in a way that inflame people's sense 
of Christian righteousness, bigotry and hatred. 
</P>
<P>
This is not the responsible reporting that I am used to reading in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
I am a Laguna Beach resident who loves my city. I am straight. I have friends 
in both the straight and gay community. I am actively involved in the fight 
against AIDS. I feel that your recent article must have been published without 
thought about what it might cost: 
</P>
<P>
* Laguna Beach and its fight against AIDS and its fight for human rights. 
</P>
<P>
* Citizens of Laguna Beach who are so proud of their city that they recently 
put together an 80% majority to tax themselves in order to "save the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
I suggest that an in-depth article on AIDS and what the Laguna Beach community 
is doing about it might be appropriate at this time. Laguna is leading the 
nation in this fight and does not deserve the effects this article may bring.

GENDER GAP CLOSES ON HOMELESS WOMEN; 
</P>
<P>
* COUNTY SIMPLY MUST FIND ROOM IN ITS HEART FOR THEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As recently as a decade ago, homelessness was mostly confined to middle-aged 
alcoholic men in urban skid rows. Today, homelessness has come to the suburbs 
and has become more an equal opportunity problem. The Urban Institute says that 
women represent about 19% of the urban homeless, and the National Coalition on 
the Homeless grimly notes that families with children -- nearly all of which 
are headed by women -- are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Details about homeless women in Orange County are sketchy, but what's clear is 
that there is a woefully inadequate number of beds and services to address the 
problem. The Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force estimates there are 
10,000-12,000 homeless people in the county, about half of them children. A 
survey taken last year by the task force found that a third of those questioned 
were women, but the actual number is thought to be somewhat lower. 
</P>
<P>
What is the profile of these homeless women? The county's major women's 
shelter, the YWCA in Santa Ana, says that homelessness affects women of all 
ages and ethnic backgrounds, but that most are 25- to 45-year-old whites who 
lived in Orange County well before losing their homes. 
</P>
<P>
Service providers say that the problem of homelessness is compounded for women 
by feelings of failure in their role as nurturers. According to a USC study of 
100 homeless families, women were concerned about their inability to provide a 
"home" for themselves and their children. Moreover, women are more vulnerable 
to rape and other street crimes than their male counterparts. They are more 
likely to seek services or shelters. 
</P>
<P>
Even without a place to live, homeless women try to provide as well as they can 
for their families. Last September, when the Orange County Rescue Mission 
offered 150 back-to-school packs to homeless and other very poor families, 900 
people showed up to claim them. 
</P>
<P>
There are many reasons why a person becomes homeless, including drug abuse. But 
there also are pervasive societal conditions that have made women increasingly 
vulnerable to homelessness: housing prices, high divorce rates, wife battering, 
a dearth of child care assistance and a job market where unequal pay rates and 
age discrimination are common. 
</P>
<P>
Younger women can have trouble getting a foothold in the economy. Older women 
have their own problems, especially if their Social Security benefits are 
meager. Once evicted, they can't get together the first- and last-month rent 
and deposits to obtain a new apartment. Some sleep in their cars or wait in 
line for a room at shelters. But today, there are barely more than 100 shelter 
spaces for women in Orange County -- a fraction of the need. 
</P>
<P>
Homelessness is expected to significantly worsen over the next few years, 
experts say. Recent efforts in Orange County to build single-room occupancy 
hotels -- dormitory-type housing for single adults -- can help, but similar 
housing is needed for families as well. Also, community support is needed for 
agencies that provide services for the homeless, including United Way, Share 
Our Selves and the Orange County Homeless Issues Task Force. Partly because of 
a crisis in donor giving last summer, food and shelter crisis relief agencies 
plan an early start this year to bring the community together to avert similar 
shortages. That's a good step. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, more women will find that, for them, the gender gap 
unfortunately is narrowing. And one thing is clear: Orange County is only 
beginning to deal with the problem.

MISS SNOW? GLORY IN OUR SACRED TRADITION OF ERSATZ WINTER; 
</P>
<P>
TO US, THE WHITE STUFF IS JUST SOMETHING ON WHICH TO SKI, BEFORE HEADING DOWN 
THE MOUNTAIN FOR A YULETIDE BEACH PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is an Orange County writer.

<TEXT>
<P>
I could never decide whether it was touching or silly: people driving down the 
mountain from Big Bear with big clods of snow skewered on their car antennae. 
You don't see it that much anymore, but it used to be a kind of a holiday 
season ritual. You took the family up the mountain to the snow, flopped around 
in it for a few hours, then took as much of it home with you as you could. 
</P>
<P>
If you drove a car, it went on the antenna and lasted until you got to the 
Orange County line, provided it was a cold day (if it was warm, you couldn't 
make it as far as Riverside). If you drove a pickup, though, you could shovel 
the stuff in by the ton, and by the time you got home you could celebrate the 
season by smearing your lawn with clammy slush. 
</P>
<P>
Currier and Ives did not live here. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there's something about the holiday season that compels native Southern 
Californians -- the people who regard an even, bronze tan as their birthright 
and howl with misery at the hint of the first brisk October breeze -- to try 
with deadly earnestness to duplicate the wintertime holiday atmosphere of a 
place they may never even have visited. Until Jan. 1, they want Costa Mesa to 
look like Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Fair enough. I visited Vermont for the first time in August, to attend a 
friend's wedding in Burlington, and I can assure you that Vermont is a worthy 
place. In August it is startlingly lush and green, the air is pure and sweet, 
Lake Champlain is clear and placid, the people are outgoing and cheerful and 
the food is good. 
</P>
<P>
Tell that to the natives and they'll thank you. They'll also give each other 
little sidelong looks before bringing up the subject of winter. It's the same 
look doctors give each other before they tell you you'll never play the violin 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Vermont in winter, they will tell you, is war. It is you against nature, and 
the deck is stacked. You must order everything in the L.L. Bean catalogue and 
wear it all at once, and even that isn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
If the Vermont roads are passable, they are either treacherously slick or 
filled with salt and abrasive frozen gravel. Starting your car in the morning 
is like performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation. And through it it all there 
is the unspoken but absolute rule that if you slip up and let the cold get to 
you, you could die. 
</P>
<P>
But here, unless you get clobbered by a falling blimp on your front lawn, the 
simple act of strolling outdoors in jeans and an aloha shirt to screw in a new 
Christmas light won't turn you into a stiff. It will in Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday cheer doesn't come easy. You can't sing Christmas carols if you can't 
move your lips. 
</P>
<P>
Still, we in Orange County get rhapsodic about such things as snowflakes and 
icicles and hoarfrost. We watch "Dr. Zhivago" and see the sleigh rides with 
Julie Christie in furs and forget about Omar Sharif stumbling across the 
steppes with the wolves howling. Snow, to us, is something that drifts down 
dreamily, settles lightly and makes a squeaking sound beneath our new skis, as 
we make the last run of the day before driving back down the mountain to make 
that 7 p.m. beach party. 
</P>
<P>
(Yes, it's possible. I've done it. And I haven't been a bit shy about telling 
East Coasters about it when they start the self-congratulatory hardy talk.) 
</P>
<P>
This is not real winter. This is Hollywood winter. It's the winter that gives 
Woody Allen so much ammunition. (Remember driving through Beverly Hills in 
"Annie Hall"?) It's a winter in which no one's face radiates painful crimson, 
snow comes in an aerosol can and the only ice is in the pina coladas. 
</P>
<P>
But so what? Vermont gets a couple of postcard days and four months of the kind 
of cold that keeps Russia from being invaded. By the time the Angels are 
playing exhibition games in Palm Springs, Vermont will have been moving in 
frigid slow motion for more than 100 days -- which makes it that much more 
difficult to dodge falling icicles -- and everyone's blood has turned to 
molasses. They stare out at the monochromatic landscape with haunted eyes and 
spend their nights reading Kafka and watching their cars decompose. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, we're having brunch on the veranda at Las Brisas and talking about 
how much fun we had at the Rose Parade when we sat on the curb on Colorado 
Boulevard in L.L. Bean shorts and Ray-Bans, sipping cold Calistogas and feeling 
sorry for the Iowa band in those heavy wool uniforms. Then we put the top down 
and gun off to Baja for a few carnitas tacos and a couple of perfect margaritas 
on the sunny side of the pool at the Rosarito Beach Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
So set up the sleigh on the dehydrated lawn. Spray that white guck on your 
windows. Put on gloves when a cold snap hits and the temperature plummets to 
58. Work up a couple of shivers, just for fun. Have a slice of pineapple and 
pass the Coppertone. Carry on the sacred tradition of ersatz winter. 
</P>
<P>
And if you've got friends in Vermont, call them and tell them what a bitter 
December we're having out here in what used to be a desert. If you're quick, 
you can hang up before their frozen lips can form a proper reply.

PROTEST IS FINE BUT OBJECT IS IN QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Greg Roa's letter ("Students Who Protest the Gulf Crisis," Dec. 16): 
I'm sorry that he misunderstood the nature of the disappointment in my letter 
of Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Roa states that he's "appalled" at my "condescending attitude." 
</P>
<P>
Well, if conclusions based on historical data sound condescending, so be it. 
But that's the best way to arrive at conclusions, and the method he should be 
learning in his social science classes. 
</P>
<P>
I presented no objections to their demonstrating; this is an American right and 
they should exercise it. What I'm disappointed in is the object of their 
protest -- our President's decision to protect innocent people and stop a 
ruthless dictator. The students are demonstrating against the wrong person. The 
scenario is clear if Saddam has his way. History has proven that reward and 
appeasement never stop a dictator. 
</P>
<P>
It's not a question of war or peace. The war is on. It was started by Saddam in 
early August. The only question is, do we stop him now, while we have committed 
allies to help, or do we face him a few years down the road when he'll have the 
nuclear capacity to start World War III? 
</P>
<P>
The son, brother, or father that Roa is concerned about now will be comparably 
insignificant relative to the numbers that will be involved in the next one. 
</P>
<P>
As an ex-teacher, I'm proud to see students participate in peaceful 
demonstrations of their convictions. I just wish their convictions were based 
on historically proven facts and sound logic. This failure is why I'm 
disappointed.

This is regarding "A Bitter Pill" (Dec. 13), about Mexican-trained 
professionals, specifically medical doctors. It is a shame that these fine 
people have to beg to work for manual labor positions due to the existing 
"racial prejudice" mentality of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
That does not speak well of our county, considering its wealth and the 
population being mostly of Latino descent. It is interesting to note that when 
Civil Rights Commissioner Phil Montez goes to audit universities on their 
"affirmative action" programs that the school administrators always claim that 
there are "not any qualified minorities to fill existing positions." Of course, 
that is not true, but school administrators just don't have the backbone to do 
the right thing and hire from the local Latino community.

KINGS LOSE 3-1 LEAD AND GAME; 
</P>
<P>
HOCKEY: VANCOUVER WINS, 4-3. L.A. IRE IS RAISED WHEN ANTICIPATED PENALTY SHOT

<P>
For an instant, everybody was frozen on the ice. 
</P>
<P>
And a game hung in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
Vancouver Canuck defenseman Robert Nordmark stared at referee Rob Schick. 
</P>
<P>
So did the rest of the Canucks. And the Kings. And a sellout Pacific Coliseum 
crowd of 16,123. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Schick did just what everybody but the Kings hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
No whistle. No call, enabling the Canucks to hold onto a 4-3 victory Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
No fair, screamed the Kings, although their exact words were probably a little 
spicier. 
</P>
<P>
The situation was this: Down by a goal, the Kings had pulled goalie Kelly 
Hrudey with a little more than a minute to go. 
</P>
<P>
Attacking with six skaters, the Kings were making a final charge at Vancouver 
goalie Kirk McLean when, with 54 seconds to play, Nordmark hit the crossbar, 
knocking the Canuck net off its mooring. 
</P>
<P>
If such a move is ruled deliberate in the final two minutes of a game, the 
attacking team is given a penalty shot. 
</P>
<P>
When Schick failed to make that call, the Kings erupted. Even Wayne Gretzky 
went after Schick in an uncharacteristic outburst. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a pretty gutless call," said Todd Elik, the man closest to Nordmark. "I 
know I didn't hit him or nothing." 
</P>
<P>
An apologetic Gretzky admitted he "was a little hot-headed about it. When a guy 
skates to the net and pushes it off, it's a penalty. I guess he (Schick) didn't 
see it." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Luc Robitaille wasn't so forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way it is in this league," he said. "In the third period, the rules 
are different. Always has been that way. Always will be." 
</P>
<P>
Schick was unavailable for comment, but Nordmark talked about the play. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to take Elik and bounced into the net," Nordmark said, "but I was too 
tired to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Did he think a penalty should have been called? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know," Nordmark replied. "I don't think so." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings didn't threaten again, but blaming this loss on the non-call takes 
quite an imagination. 
</P>
<P>
There was blame enough for everyone in a King uniform on a night when the team 
started fast, built a 3-1 first-period lead and then disappeared for the next 
20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
The replacement of starting goalie Troy Gamble with McLean might have had 
something to do with the Canucks' resurgence, but five shots on goal by the 
Kings in the second period had more to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of guys didn't seem to want the puck tonight," Robitaille said. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said King Coach Tom Webster. "We played a solid first 
period and then we sat back and did not go after them in the second. You can't 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
Goals by Brian Benning (his third), Mike Donnelly (first) and John Tonelli 
(sixth) pushed the Kings into the early lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gino Odjick's fourth goal was all the Canucks had to show for the first 20 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
But second-period goals by Jyrki Lumme (fourth) and Gred Adams (ninth) tied the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' shooting difficulties continued into the first part of the third 
period. They had only one shot on goal in the first six minutes, but then woke 
and took 13 shots over the rest of the period to wind up outshooting Vancouver, 
27-26. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't enough. The winning goal came 7:31 into the final period. Kings 
defenseman Bob Halkidis, trying to clear the puck from the side of his own net, 
put it on the stick of Vancouver defenseman Kevan Guy. 
</P>
<P>
And Guy promptly put it between Hrudey's pads for his first goal of the season 
in his 24th game. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey, in obvious disgust, stared up at the roof as the Canucks celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
The loss gave the Kings a 1-2 mark for the three-game trip, a 2-6-4 record 
since their slump began and an overall record of 18-11-5. 
</P>
<P>
The Smythe Division-leading Calgary Flames also lost Saturday, so the Kings 
remain three points behind. 
</P>
<P>
But they have to look both ways now. The Canucks improve to 17-17-3 and are 
only four points behind the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
"We had that game," said Robitaille, who had several shots at McLean in the 
final moments but couldn't convert. "They were sleeping. We gave it to them." 
</P>
<P>
Call or no call. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings continue to squander opportunities on the power play. They were zero 
for three Saturday. On the three-game trip, they were successful on one of 13 
attempts. . . . The news from the home front is not good for the Kings. Wing 
Tony Granato, who flew home Thursday, has a strained rib cartilage and will be 
out two to three weeks. Fellow wing Scott Bjugstad has a sprained knee and will 
be out three to four weeks. Wing Tomas Sandstrom continues to experience 
discomfort from the fracture in his lower back. He isn't expected to return 
until the middle of January. Also home is defenseman Marty McSorley, out nearly 
a month with soreness in the rib cage. . . . Added to the already lengthy 
injured list is defenseman Rod Buskas, out with a strained chest muscle. . . . 
The Kings get a three-day holiday break, resume practice Wednesday and return 
to action Thursday night at the Forum against the Philadelphia Flyers.

BIG EAST HOPING FOR BETTER DAYS IN ITS FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE GERGEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Let's just say the Big East has had better days. 
</P>
<P>
In the span of 24 hours, the college conference lost one of its major power 
brokers, saw an institution suffer embarrassment over a hiring and, last but 
certainly not least, had one of the basketball programs that are the foundation 
of the league accused of behavior certain to draw the scrutiny of NCAA 
investigators. Two of the developments are the direct result of the Big East's 
decision to accommodate its members fielding Division-I football teams by 
adding the University of Miami. The third is fundamental to the image of the 
remarkably successful conference. 
</P>
<P>
Sam Jankovich, the athletic director who got the best deal for Miami in the 
major realignment taking place in college sports, resigned from the university 
to assume command of the lowly National Football League franchise currently 
operating in New England. The man was introduced to the media as the chief 
executive office of the Patriots Thursday in Foxboro, Mass. The Patriots are 
nearing the end of a season in which the team has established itself as the 
worst in the NFL and the organization was publicly chastised and fined for its 
handling of a sexual harassment claim by a female reporter. For what amounts to 
a herculean task, Jankovich will be paid as well as a professional linebacker, 
no small achievement for a balding 56-year-old administrator who wears thick 
glasses. 
</P>
<P>
During Jankovich's seven years plus at Miami, the school not only was credited 
with three national football championships but revived its long dormant 
basketball program. It was largely for the sake of basketball, which has yet to 
generate much success or community support, that he aligned the school with the 
Big East. The Hurricanes will participate in league play starting next season. 
</P>
<P>
No more than 40 miles away from Foxboro, in the affluent Boston suburb of 
Chestnut Hill, a news conference to introduce the new head football coach at 
Boston College had to be scrapped when the appointee, Jimmye Laycock, called 
Athletic Director Chet Gladchuk in the pre-dawn hours to say that, on second 
thought, he wanted to remain at William &amp; Mary. Only a few days earlier, 
the first choice, Frank Beamer of Virginia Tech, had withdrawn his name from 
consideration. All this came about because in committing its football program 
to a permanent alliance with Syracuse, Pittsburgh and, especially, Miami, as 
well as four colleges to be named later, BC felt Jack Bicknell couldn't cut it 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
To anyone exposed to Bicknell during his decade at The Heights, it was an 
unfortunate decision. Not so much because the man had compiled a 59-55-1 record 
against demanding schedules, not so much because he had guided the Eagles to 
four bowl games or to their first consecutive Lambert Trophies since the days 
of Frank Leahy, not so much because he had given an unsolicited freshman 
quarterback named Doug Flutie room to stretch his imagination, but because he 
was the ideal person to represent an institution of higher learning. Cowboy 
Jack was a class act who did considerable good for BC's image as a serious and 
ambitious university and, despite four straight losing seasons, he deserved the 
opportunity to run a program that finally would be placed in a structured 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
Of greater concern to the conference, however, are the allegations in the 
Syracuse Post-Standard that the basketball program at Syracuse broke dozens of 
NCAA rules during the course of the last eight years. Most involved money and 
favors from boosters, including Coach Jim Boeheim's closest friend, but one 
involved the changing of a grade so that a player might retain his eligibility. 
The program also had been cited in "Raw Recruits," a book highlighting abuses 
in big-time college basketball,for its connection with a New York "scout" who 
steered players to the university. 
</P>
<P>
In 11 years, the Big East has risen to a place of great prominence in college 
sports without any of its members being sanctioned by the NCAA. Although it has 
never won a national championship in the sport, Syracuse is the single most 
significant member of the league, the result not only of a winning tradition 
but the on-campus Carrier Dome, home to the largest crowds in the country and 
site of many national telecasts. The Syracuse program was the one the 
conference could not have lived without, the one that forced commissioner Mike 
Tranghese to include Miami in future plans so as to prevent the Orangemen from 
joining another all-sports alignment. 
</P>
<P>
An extraordinary gathering of boxers took place Tuesday night at Madison Square 
Garden, which used to be synonymous with the sport but lately has been inactive 
as a fight club. Alas, heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield, former 
titleholder Mike Tyson and the ever-popular Sugar Ray Leonard were attending a 
basketball game between the Knicks and Lakers. Of the three, only Leonard has 
the Garden in his plans, another comeback bout in February. He underscored his 
lack of familiarity with basketball by clanking three free throws off the front 
rim in a shoot for charity during an early timeout. 
</P>
<P>
Holyfield and Tyson both were in town to promote the agreements signed by their 
promoters with cable outfits planning to establish rival pay-per-view networks. 
Holyfield will lead off with George Foreman in April in what shapes up as a 
fine example of mass entertainment. Tyson will have a go with Razor Ruddock, 
whom he previously avoided under mysterious circumstances, in March. 
</P>
<P>
The latter is a curious choice for a man in position to challenge the winner of 
Holyfield-Foreman for mega-millions. Apparently, Tyson has convinced himself he 
is once again invincible after dismantling Alex Stewart two weeks ago. And Don 
King has not been moved to dissuade him, even if there is no title at stake and 
the payoff will be what the promoter calls "chump change." Either way, King 
stays in the game. He has future calls on both men, but the match carries a 
major risk for Tyson.

3 USC GUARDS ARE TOO MANY FOR AUGUSTA; 
</P>
<P>
BASKETBALL: TROJANS WIN, 90-63, FOR FIFTH VICTORY IN A ROW. MINER SCORES 27. 
</P>

<P>
With its new three-guard attack, USC won its fifth consecutive basketball game 
and moved a step closer to its Jan. 2 showdown with UCLA by defeating Augusta 
College of Georgia, 90-63, Saturday at the Sports Arena before 1,885. 
</P>
<P>
USC is 6-1, its best start since 1975. The Trojans' five-game winning streak is 
their longest since their 1985 Pacific 10 championship team. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore guard Harold Miner led USC with 27 points and eight rebounds, but he 
had plenty of support in senior forward Ronnie Coleman, who scored 18 points, 
grabbed 12 rebounds and had five steals. 
</P>
<P>
With Miner teamed with Robert Pack and Duane Cooper in the backcourt, "people 
are definitely taking us seriously now," Miner said. "They just look at our 
record and see how we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
USC's biggest victories have been on the road against Colorado State and Notre 
Dame. But, after games against Harvard and Brooklyn College in the Long Beach 
Holiday Classic Dec. 28 and 29, the Trojans' real test will come against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
"Yes, people are talking about our game with UCLA somewhat," Miner said, which 
is something USC Coach George Raveling is worried about. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players that our next three games (including Augusta) are our most 
dangerous," Raveling said. "I wasn't trying to be a Lou Holtz, but when 
everybody thinks that games are in the bag . . . those games turn out to be the 
dangerous ones." 
</P>
<P>
Augusta, of the Big South Conference, is 1-8 and has played one home game. 
Against USC, the Jaguars shot 36% and committed 28 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
USC opened an 11-3 lead, and the Jaguars did not score their first point until 
nearly four minutes had elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
USC's three-guard lineup caused problems with its quickness and aggressiveness. 
Featuring a full-court, trapping defense, the Trojans capitalized on five early 
turnovers and two blocked shots by freshman forward Mark Boyd to take a 22-8 
lead with 11:23 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
Augusta did not reach double figures until 9:50 was left in the first half. The 
Jaguars made a run behind the scoring of Keenan Mann, who had 12 points in the 
first half, and Jermaine Henegan, who scored eight, to cut USC's lead to 29-22 
with 5:43 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
That was as close as Augusta would get. USC closed out the half by outscoring 
the Jaguars, 14-6, to take a 43-28 halftime lead, Miner scoring 17 first-half 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, Cooper, who was in foul trouble for most of the game and 
scored only two points, played a key defensive role as USC opened a 20-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"The pressure we put on in the second half created a lot of easy baskets for 
us," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Augusta's shooting was so poor in the second half, there was a four-minute 
stretch when USC made one of nine shots but outscored the Jaguars by a point. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a combination of defense and poor ballhandling," Raveling said 
of Augusta's turnovers. "We did a good job of rallying to the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Coleman, who made three of nine first-half shots, scored seven points in the 
first five minutes after the break and finished with 11 points in the half. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little shabby in the first half," he said. "But, in the second half, I 
stopped rushing my shots and used better judgment."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NOTES; 
</P>
<P>
EXPOSURE ALMOST ADDS TO UNLV'S TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The last thing UNLV needs is help in getting in trouble with the NCAA. Yet that 
is what almost happened with the school and Sports Illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
The Runnin' Rebels' program, which was granted an appeal to defend its NCAA 
championship this season in return for being kept out of next year's tournament 
for violations dating to 1977, and which received a letter of inquiry this week 
about more recent violations, almost incurred a violation for the way the 
magazine posed and dressed two of its players. 
</P>
<P>
In the periodical's Nov. 19 College Basketball issue, UNLV forwards Larry 
Johnson and Stacey Augmon were dressed in stylish outfits from shoes to 
overcoats. The magazine included a tag line giving credit for the items to each 
manufacturer, a definite violation of NCAA rules as far as amateur athletes 
promoting products. 
</P>
<P>
An NCAA spokesman said it was a "non-issue." 
</P>
<P>
"Legislative Services was in contact with the school right away," Jim Marchiony 
said. "The kids and UNLV were able to verify that they did not know Sports 
Illustrated was going to put the credits in. If they had known it would have 
been some kind of violation." 
</P>
<P>
The first NCAA individual statistics for the season are out and the 
Southwestern Athletic Conference takes a back seat to no other league as far as 
scoring goes. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top six scorers in Division I through Dec. 17 play for SWAC 
schools, including Nos. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
Bobby Phills, a 6-foot-4 senior guard from Southern University, tops the 
scoring list at 37.0 points per game, 17 points higher than his average last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Alphonso Ford, a 6-4 sophomore from Mississippi Valley State, is second at 
34.8, just better than his 29.9 as a freshman which was good enough to lead the 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Rogers, a 6-5 junior from Alabama State, is tied for sixth at 29.9, 
slightly better than his 29.7 last season when he was fifth in the nation in 
scoring and eighth in steals at 3.1 per game. 
</P>
<P>
Three NCAA records have been tied already this season and one gets an asterisk 
in the shape of a video camera. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV matched the record for 3-pointers in a game with 21 against Nevada in a 
50-point win. There was no doubt that tied the standard set last season by 
Kentucky against North Carolina and matched by Loyola Marymount against 
Michigan in the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Samford went 34-for-34 from the free throw line on Thursday night in an 89-80 
victory over Central Florida. The win snapped a nine-game losing streak for the 
Bulldogs and the free throw shooting matched the best ever for a minimum of 30 
in game as Cal-Irvine went 34-for-34 against Pacific on Feb. 21, 1981. 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young's 7-6 freshman center Shawn Bradley blocked 14 shots in a 90-86 
victory over Eastern Kentucky in the opening round of the Cougar Classic to tie 
David Robinson's mark for swats set against N.C.-Wilmington on Jan. 4, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
When the game ended, however, Bradley had been credited with just 12 blocks. A 
further review of game films verified the two more which got him a piece of the 
record. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholls State point guard Ray Washington was activated with his Louisiana 
National Guard unit as part of Operation Desert Shield. He averaged 4.9 points, 
5.1 rebounds and a team-leading 4.5 assists and 2.4 steals when he was called 
to active duty last week. 
</P>
<P>
Several of his teammates wore gray sweatbands with Washington's No. 10 on them 
in his honor. Washington was the second Nicholls State athlete to be called to 
active duty as tailback Bennett Williams received his orders last month. 
</P>
<P>
Georgetown didn't lose a player to the Mideast military action, but the Hoyas 
did lose their voice. 
</P>
<P>
Rich Chvotkin, who just started his 17th season calling Georgetown games on the 
radio, was called to active duty and is set to leave for the Persian Gulf in 
the immediate future. Chvotkin, who is a lieutenant colonel with the Army 
Medical Services' Combat Psychiatry Unit, called the first four games of the 
season before receiving his orders. Chvotkin's full-time job is as a 
psychologist with the Washington Instsitute. 
</P>
<P>
Fairfield has had one of the country's most amazing offensive turnarounds. The 
Stags averaged 57.7 points per game last season and 60.2 over the last two 
years. This season, Mitch Buonaguro's team is averaging 86.4 points over the 
first seven games, a difference of more than 28 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
An update on two coaches who had health problems this season: 
</P>
<P>
Southwest Texas State's Harry Larrabee, who suffered a mild stress-related 
stroke just before a game in Missoula, Mont., last month, was discharged from 
the hospital and has begun his recovery at home. With some weakness in his left 
side, doctors have imposed a late-December earliest return to any on-court 
duties, quite a difference from the early prognosis of a full season off. 
</P>
<P>
Wichita State's Mike Cohen, who tore his patella tendon below his left knee 
when he was accidentally bumped by one of his players as he was leaving the 
floor at halftime of the Shockers' upset of Alabama, will remain in a brace and 
on crutches for a minimum of 8-10 weeks. He faces a minimum of two months' 
therapy after that for the injury which usually ends athletes' careers.

DUKE ENDS OKLAHOMA'S HOME WIN STREAK AT 51

Ninth-ranked Duke found a way to stop Oklahoma's three-point shooting Saturday 
and in the process stopped the 11th-ranked Sooners' 51-game homecourt winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma made seven three-pointers in the first half -- five by Terry Evans -- 
but missed all nine of its tries in the second half when Duke rallied for a 
90-85 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense of the three-point shot in the second half I thought was the key," 
Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski said. "They're really an outstanding basketball team 
and I'm proud of our guys to beat a team like this. Whether they're playing at 
home or away doesn't make any difference. They're just damn good." 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma's last home loss had come against Kansas State in the final 
regular-season game in 1987. The Sooners (8-2) hadn't lost to a non-conference 
opponent since Tulsa beat them in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The winning streak was the longest in the nation, along with Arizona's. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we left a lot to be desired defensively," Oklahoma coach Billy Tubbs 
said. "A lot of things broke down, but I think our defense broke down the most. 
</P>
<P>
"We're disappointed that our record was stopped, but we were disappointed 51 
games ago when it was stopped. Our guys will regroup and be ready to play 
again." 
</P>
<P>
Grant Hill and Christian Laettner scored 19 points apiece, Thomas Hill had 16 
and Bobby Hurley had 13 -- 12 in the second half -- as Duke (8-2) overcame a 
five-point halftime deficit. The Blue Devils also had a 39-29 rebounding edge. 
</P>
<P>
The loss spoiled an outstanding effort by Oklahoma forward Jeff Webster, who 
scored 32 points. He had 22 of the Sooners' 35 second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, after bombarding the Blue Devils in the first half, was held to just one 
basket in the second. He also committed 11 turnovers. Brent Price, the team's 
leading scorer with a 25-point average, scored just 11. 
</P>
<P>
"What we were just trying to do was keep them a little bit farther out or make 
them have to work just a little bit more to get their shots," Krzyzewski said. 
"Our perimeter defense did a much better job in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Evans had three three-pointers in the opening 4 1/2 minutes when Oklahoma took 
a 19-12 lead. Then Laettner scored seven straight points for the Blue Devils, 
bringing them to 22-21 with 11:56 left in the half. But a 14-5 Oklahoma spurt 
made it 36-26 with 6:19 left. 
</P>
<P>
Laettner had 12 points by the time the game was 11 minutes old, but didn't 
score the rest of the half. Grant Hill and Thomas Hill picked up the slack. 
Grant Hill had 12 points at halftime, Thomas Hill 8. 
</P>
<P>
"I told our team at the half I thought we were playing excellent basketball and 
that Oklahoma was playing a little better, and to just keep their heads up," 
Krzyzewski said. "Sometimes when you're playing real well and losing, you can 
get down on yourself." 
</P>
<P>
That didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
Hurley made a pair of driving shots inside as Duke opened the second half with 
a 10-4 spurt to take a 55-54 lead. Then he made a three-pointer later in the 
half that started an 11-2 surge that put the Blue Devils up 78-70 with 7:44 to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners, with no perimeter offense, got no closer than 83-79 with 2:46 
left. Duke was able to respond by scoring six straight points. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma shot only 42 percent in the second half after having shot 60 percent 
in the first. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought they did a good job defensively," Tubbs said. "I don't think we had 
anything going in the second half except Webster. A lot of teams try to stop 
certain players, but your other players are supposed to take up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
Krzyzewski said it was a much-needed victory for his team, which had already 
lost tough games to Arkansas and Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a chance to beat Arkansas," he said. "We had a chance to beat 
Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
"But you can't just have chances. You've got to do it. I think they didn't want 
to just be satisfied getting close."

<P>
Loara High guard Tes Whitlock broke an 80-year-old Orange County record by 
scoring 68 points Saturday in a 112-102 victory over Saddleback in the 
third-place consolation game of the Irvine World News Tournament at Christ 
College Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock broke the county's single-game mark of 58 points set by Art Worthy of 
Huntington Beach High in 1910. Whitlock's previous high was 54 points against 
Los Alamitos last year. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock made 20 of 31 field goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Whitlock's point total was the fifth highest in Southern Section history. Nick 
Tenneriello of Colbert holds the section mark of 74 points set in the 1967-68 
season. TOM HAMILTON

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
BARKLEY POWERS 76ERS PAST PISTONS, 106-99 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charles Barkley is having the kind of season most valuable players have. 
</P>
<P>
The forward for the Philadelphia 76ers has been leading the NBA in scoring most 
of the season and has been near the top in shooting percentage and among the 
leaders in rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
He has been instrumental in the 76ers getting off to a better start than they 
did last season. Although the Detroit Pistons double and triple-teamed him 
Saturday night at Philadelphia, Barkley scored 22 points and had 12 rebounds in 
a 106-99 victory that gave the 76ers an 18-8 record. Last season, they won only 
14 of their first 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
After losing seven of eight, the Pistons had won two in a row at home. But 
while they were ganging up on Barkley, they left guards Rickey Green and Hersey 
Hawkins alone. Green had a season-high 25 points, while Hawkins scored all of 
his 21 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit took a 72-70 lead on a jumper by Mark Aguirre with almost 11 minutes 
remaining. But Hawkins converted consecutive three-point plays to give the 
76ers a lead they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
"In the first half I was trying to make things happen," Hawkins said. "In the 
second half things came around for me and we took charge." 
</P>
<P>
Isiah Thomas led the Pistons (16-10) with 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been having our problems on the road," he said. "In the fourth quarter 
instead of stopping them we were sending them to the line." 
</P>
<P>
Milwaukee 114, San Antonio 98 -- After losing Friday night at Dallas, the Bucks 
came out ready to play at San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Spurs were a bit weary from an overtime battle against 
the Suns at Phoenix. They missed 12 of their first 14 shots and fell behind by 
14 points. 
</P>
<P>
The energy it took to pull even by halftime took its toll and the Spurs 
couldn't keep up in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Sikma, who made six three-point baskets, led the Bucks with 29 points and 
played David Robinson nearly on even terms. Robinson had 25 points and eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Sikma's three-pointers came during a 16-7 run with which the Bucks 
opened the last quarter to clinch their 18th victory in 26 games. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 128, Indiana 118 -- Although the Bulls played a tough game Friday night 
against the Lakers, they came out strong at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
They scored 44 points in the first quarter and opened a 20-point lead. This 
allowed them to give Michael Jordan, who played 44 minutes in the victory over 
the Lakers, a good rest. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they almost gave Jordan, who scored 29 points in 34 minutes, too much 
rest. 
</P>
<P>
The Pacers, paced by Chuck Person and Vern Fleming, came charging back in the 
second half. Three quick baskets to open the fourth quarter cut the lead to 
100-98. 
</P>
<P>
But Jordan came back and teamed with John Paxson to give the Bulls a 
comfortable final margin. Paxson finished with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
Washington 109, Cleveland 89 -- Bernard King rarely has two poor games in a 
row. After scoring only 16 points and missing 15 of 23 shots Friday night, he 
figured to be effective at Richfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
He was. On 20 for 30 from the field and six for six from the free-throw line, 
the NBA scoring leader had 46 points to lead the Bullets to their third victory 
in a row and fourth in the last five. 
</P>
<P>
The Cavaliers are 2-9 since losing Mark Price, their point guard, with a 
season-ending knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
King had 28 points in the first half and the Bullets were able to keep the 
intensity going. 
</P>
<P>
Houston 122, Phoenix 102 -- Akeem Olajuwon had 24 points and 19 rebounds and 
Sleepy Floyd came off the bench to have a big night at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Floyd, making 10 of 16 shots, had 24 points and nine assists and did a solid 
job defensing the Suns' playmaker, Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who appeared to be tired after playing 42 minutes Friday night, was 
two for 11 and had only four points. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 104, Orlando 96 -- Karl Malone had 15 of his 34 points in the last quarter 
at Orlando and keyed a late surge to beat the Magic. 
</P>
<P>
The Magic, which lost four road games recently after leading in the final 
minute, pulled even, 89-89, with four minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point play by Malone put the Jazz in front to stay. 
</P>
<P>
New York 106, New Jersey 93 -- Kiki Vandeweghe missed a driving layup at the 
buzzer Friday night to cost the Knicks a tie, but he made up for it in this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Vandeweghe scored six points in a 13-2 spurt midway through the fourth quarter 
that broke open a tight game. When Charles Oakley ended the rally with a 
three-point play, the Knicks led, 97-82, with 4:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
Dallas 119, Denver 110 -- Already deprived of their leading scorer, Orlando 
Woolridge, for at least the next two months, the Nuggets were struck by injury 
again at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
They were leading, 89-78, at Denver, with 10 minutes left, but lost both Todd 
Lichti and Chris Jackson with ankle injuries. The Mavericks outscored the 
Nuggets, 41-21, the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle 121, Sacramento 93 -- Eddie Johnson scored 25 points at Seattle and the 
SuperSonics routed the Kings for the second time in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Golden State 115, Minnesota 102 -- The Warriors' Chris Mullin, Tim Hardaway and 
Mitch Richmond had 36 of the Warriors' 38 points when they increased a 
three-point lead to 91-77 at Oakland. DAN HAFNER

LIONS WIN, PUT PACKERS INTO PLAYOFF FREEZER

GREEN BAY, Wis. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Lions left the Green Bay Packers out in the cold Saturday. And out 
of the NFL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Sanders ran six yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 3:37 left and Ray 
Crockett returned a fumble recovery for another score in the fourth quarter as 
the Lions beat the Packers, 24-17, in the coldest game at Lambeau Field since 
the 1967 "Ice Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers (6-9) lost their fourth in a row and were eliminated from 
contention for the third NFC wild-card spot. The Lions, already out of the 
playoff picture, also are 6-9. 
</P>
<P>
Game-time temperature was two degrees, with winds of 23 m.p.h. That resulted in 
a wind-chill of minus-28. 
</P>
<P>
"Once you're out there, no matter how much you put on, you're still cold. You 
try to block it out, but you can't," said Crockett, who ended Green Bay's final 
threat with an interception. 
</P>
<P>
Crockett's freak 22-yard fumble return with 10:42 left tied the score, 17-17. 
Green Bay's Ed West caught a pass, but the ball popped into the air after he 
hit the ground. Crockett caught the ball before it hit the ground and ran in 
for the touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"It bounced off his body," Crockett said. "I didn't know whether it was an 
interception or a fumble, but I knew it was a live ball." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay's Michael Haddix fumbled at the Detroit 26 with 7:32 left and 
Detroit's Chris Spielman recovered. Sanders, who carried 19 times for 133 
yards, then ran 37 yards to the Packers' 13. Three plays later, he sprinted 
around the right side for the go-ahead touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I've played in snow, but it wasn't this cold," said Sanders, who took over the 
league rushing lead from San Diego's Marion Butts. "I thought we did a great 
job of keeping team morale up. We anticipated it being cold, but not this cold. 
We knew were in for a freezer." 
</P>
<P>
Third-string quarterback Blair Kiel, making his second NFL start in six 
seasons, moved Green Bay to the Lions' 14 in the closing minutes. But Crockett 
intercepted with 1:51 remaining to end the threat. 
</P>
<P>
"I really thought we were going to score on that last drive," said Kiel, who 
completed 20 of 36 passes for 239 yards. "The field was very icy in the middle, 
but we can't use that as an excuse. We just did not do it -- again." 
</P>
<P>
The Packers, who failed to make the playoffs last season despite a 10-6 record, 
are out again. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably end up 6-10 and that's very disappointing," Green Bay Coach 
Lindy Infante said. "But really we should not even be considered for a spot 
because we are not playing all that well at this time." 
</P>
<P>
Darrell Thompson's 76-yard kickoff return to open second-half gave Green Bay a 
14-7 lead, which was cut to 14-10 by Eddie Murray's 22-yard field goal. Chris 
Jacke's 25-yard field goal with 12 seconds left in the third quarter put the 
Packers ahead, 17-10.

The Indianapolis Colts' playoff chances are out of their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Even a 35-28 victory over the Washington Redskins on a 25-yard interception 
return by rookie Alan Grant in the final minute Saturday settled nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"Who knows?" said quarterback Jeff George, whose three touchdown passes 
included one that tied the game with a little more than a minute to go. 
</P>
<P>
"I know we're (good enough to be) a playoff team; we've proven that. We'll just 
have to see," George said. 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins (9-6) already had clinched their first NFC playoff berth in three 
years, and the victory kept alive Indianapolis' slim hopes for an AFC wild-card 
berth. 
</P>
<P>
But the Colts (7-8) still need to beat Miami next week, and that won't be 
enough if either Cincinnati, Pittsburgh or Seattle also win. 
</P>
<P>
"I just dropped back in a short zone and was in between two receivers," said 
Grant, whose interception off Mark Rypien was the first of his career and gave 
him his first NFL touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw he was getting pressure and was going to get rid of the ball really 
quick," the rookie defensive back said. "Just as he released it I stepped in 
front of the receiver. It happened so quick. . . . The ball was just there. I 
can't describe it, it happened so fast. It was all on instinct." 
</P>
<P>
The Redskins appeared to have the game under control after two touchdown passes 
by Rypien and four field goals by Chip Lohmiller, including a career-best 
56-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
Lohmiller's fourth field goal, a 27-yarder with 4:15 to play, put the Redskins 
ahead, 28-21. The Colts had to punt on the next possession but got the ball 
back with two minutes to go after Clarence Verdin returned a short punt by 
Washington to the Redskins' 37. 
</P>
<P>
George completed a 12-yard pass to Bill Brooks for the tying touchdown with 
1:21 to play. 
</P>
<P>
Rypien, who completed 18 of 37 passes for 249 yards, started the next drive at 
the Redskins' 21. Twenty-five seconds later, Grant intercepted the pass and ran 
untouched into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
George hit 18 of 33 passes for 252 yards, including two touchdowns to Stanley 
Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
Washington cornerback Sidney Johnson was hospitalized with a concussion after 
being knocked unconscious while covering a kickoff late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
He left the field on a stretcher and regained consciousness in the ambulance on 
the way to Methodist Hospital. There were no abnormal findings, but he 
underwent a CAT scan as a precaution and was to remain hospitalized overnight.

PRINCIPAL, ADMINISTRATOR RESIGN OVER SEX SCANDAL 
</P>

<P>
The Norwalk-La Mirada school board accepted the resignations last week of an 
elementary school principal and a district administrator six weeks after it was 
disclosed that a district security guard allegedly discovered the two having 
sex on school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
At a special closed-door session Wednesday, the board accepted the resignations 
of La Pluma Elementary School Principal Michael Newcomb and Christine 
Roubidoux, the district's director of elementary programs, according to board 
attorney James Baca. 
</P>
<P>
Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District officials said a security guard 
allegedly found the two having sex in Newcomb's office one Sunday last fall. 
Newcomb and Roubidoux have neither publicly confirmed nor denied the 
allegations. 
</P>
<P>
"Both employees have tendered resignations effective Jan. 31, 1991," Baca said 
Thursday. "Other than that, we are not at liberty to comment any further." 
</P>
<P>
News of the resignations angered parents of pupils at the La Mirada elementary 
school, many of whom have accused the district of overreacting to the 
allegations. Parents recently collected 250 signatures in support of the 
popular principal and have called on the school board to hold a special public 
session to discuss the incident. 
</P>
<P>
"I am appalled by the decision, and I know a lot of other parents will be too," 
said Pam Severns, a parent who works lunchtime and recess duty at the school. 
"I feel the board pressured them into resignation. . . . They were two 
consenting adults on their own time, and the only indiscretion was location. I 
had really hoped that the board would come up with some kind of alternative, 
maybe just move him to another school or demote him." 
</P>
<P>
Newcomb and Roubidoux have been on paid administrative leave since the 
allegations were leaked to a local weekly newspaper last month. Both will 
continue to be paid through Jan. 31, but Baca would not say whether the 
district agreed to any other financial terms. District officials have routinely 
declined to discuss the allegations, saying they involve confidential personnel 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Baca said earlier that Newcomb and Roubidoux had "requested the opportunity of 
resignation" and attorneys for both sides were working out the details. 
</P>
<P>
Newcomb, reached at his home in Tustin, would not comment on the district's 
announcement. His attorney, George William Shaeffer Jr., did not return phone 
calls, and efforts to reach Roubidoux were unsuccessful.

BELL'S REGENCY CASINO PLAYS A NEW HAND; 
</P>
<P>
GAMBLING: NEW MANAGEMENT OF FALTERING CARD CLUB HOPES TO TURN THINGS AROUND. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a gambler's world there is one maxim that it pays to remember: never count 
on anything. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of beginning with a bang six months ago, the Regency Card Club and 
Casino, began to fizzle the day the door was opened. 
</P>
<P>
The parking lot remained empty. More than two-thirds of the tables were 
unoccupied, and the employees who manned them were idle. 
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, club owner John Chi brought in a management team to chart a 
new course for the faltering casino, and Bell city officials are keeping a wary 
eye on the operation of the club. 
</P>
<P>
"Things just didn't materialize the way we thought they would," said City 
Manager John Bramble. 
</P>
<P>
Chi, president of Mutual Investment Group, which owns the Regency, replaced 
Mark Tenner, the general manager, with a management team of three men, each 
with extensive backgrounds in running casinos. 
</P>
<P>
The change was of vital interest to the city because it receives 8% to 13% of 
the casino gross revenues. Bell city officials budgeted $650,000 in casino 
taxes for 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Bramble said that during the first month the city received about $29,000. Since 
then, the city's share from the casino has leveled off at about $53,000 a 
month, totaling about $175,000 by the end of October. Bramble said that if the 
city continues to receive about $50,000 a month for the remaining seven months 
of this fiscal year, it would be in fair shape, though it would not meet its 
projected income from the casino. 
</P>
<P>
The club is grossing about $550,000 a month, which is not a lot of income for a 
card club that cost millions of dollars to buy and operate. 
</P>
<P>
Not far from the Regency Card Club and Casino on Eastern Avenue, the mammoth 
Bicycle Club, which has almost four times as many tables as the Regency, brings 
in an astonishing $100 million a year and pays about $10 million in taxes to 
the city of Bell Gardens. The Regency is hoping to make only $12 million in its 
first year. 
</P>

"At this point I think the thing we have to say is that the casino is 
operational," Bramble said. "It's not as successful as it might be, but it's 
not a disaster, either." 
</P>
<P>
City officials and the current management team said the mistake of former 
general manager Tenner was that he counted on immediate success. 
</P>
<P>
He hired more than 600 employees, enough to staff a fully operational casino, 
but too many for a fledging 60-table card parlor. He hired away personnel from 
the Bicycle Club and put them in positions that were beyond their areas of 
expertise, the current managers said. He spent too much money in the first 
months, much more money that was coming in, said the new casino president, Alan 
Soh. 
</P>
<P>
Soh said all money problems cannot be blamed on Tenner. Until last week, the 
club was operating with a temporary license from the state Department of Gaming 
Registration, which investigates all casino investors and grants licenses to 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of a permanent license caused contractors and others with whom the 
club did business to demand payment up front. Potential investors in Mutual 
Investment shied away. No one, Soh said, would extend credit, which jeopardized 
Mutual Investment Group's cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Thursday, Tenner said that he believed that if Mutual 
Investment Group had not run into money problems, he would be at the Regency 
today. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, when a business goes bad, it's like a baseball team: the manager is 
the first to go," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that he did over-staff but said that there were two choices: 
staff, expecting the worst, "in which case you give bad service," or provide a 
well-trained, large staff "to provide the best possible service." Tenner chose 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
But perhaps Tenner's fatal mistake, said new casino general manager Randy 
Sears, is that he made the Regency Card Club and Casino a casino with all Asian 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"(When I arrived here) I found a beautiful casino with not too many tables in 
action and a lot of employees," he said. "I think the idea of having a strictly 
Asian casino was something that people found repugnant. Neither Asians nor 
anyone else likes the idea of a segregated club." 
</P>
<P>
Tenner said that making it an all-Asian-games club was "a calculated risk." The 
Asian games are the most profitable games at the neighboring Bicycle Club and 
the Commerce Club. 
</P>
<P>
"Had the construction been completed on time, I think it would have worked," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The club was to be completed in time for its grand opening last July 6 but work 
was not finished until August. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was full of anticipation, and then the club wasn't ready," Tenner 
said. "We lost a lot of momentum." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the club would have caught on if Tenner had been given more time to 
smooth out the operation, but, Soh said, Regency owner Chi, a Newport Beach 
real estate developer, was worried about how much money had been spent. 
</P>
<P>
"He (Tenner) was basically asked to leave," said a former employee of the club 
who asked not to be identified. "The investors didn't think things were going 
well enough. We all thought we were doing a decent job." 
</P>
<P>
Though Tenner has a reputation for turning fledgling or troubled businesses 
into profitable operations and for being a gambler, he does not have what the 
new management team has: half a lifetime in the casino and entertainment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Regency general manager Sears, 43, worked his way up in the casino business 
from his first job as a change maker at the nickel slot machines in Reno. His 
last job was casino shift manager at the Flamingo Hilton in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
His casino manager is Bill Lang, 35, who also started at the bottom of the Reno 
casino ladder and worked his way up to casino manager in charge of Asian games 
at the Flamingo Hilton in Reno. 
</P>
<P>
Soh, 41, is a Singapore-born manager who once worked at the Bicycle Club in 
Bell Gardens. After several years at the Bicycle Club, he was hired by a Chains 
International Hotels Group that invests in hotels worldwide. It was while 
working as executive vice president for the firm in Hong Kong that he met 
Regency owner Chi, he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Chains International is now negotiating with Chi to become a partner in 
the club. 
</P>
<P>
Since the team was hired in mid-October, it has launched a massive cost-cutting 
program, laying off nearly 200 employees and cutting the payroll in half. In 
the first month, Soh said, it cut overhead costs by $200,000. It has also 
introduced poker games to the casino. 
</P>
<P>
The games include California Blackjack 22, a game played with 56 instead of 52 
cards, and Nine's Up, an Asian card game. 
</P>
<P>
Soh said that the Regency is advertising in multilingual newspapers but that 
advertising is only part of the formula for success. 
</P>
<P>
"The gamblers are such that they want to see money on the table," Soh said. 
"Their first concern is, 'Do you have the money for us to take back?' They want 
to see action, and that is what we don't have right now." 
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday night, only about 10 of the 45 tables were busy. A few people 
sat at a brass-and-marble raised bar that gives customers at the rear of the 
casino a clear view of all the tables. 
</P>
<P>
At the back of the club, where daily buffets are offered, a raucous group was 
gathered in a dark lounge. Next door, a fancy dining room sat empty. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Soh, Sears and Lang are not discouraged. The new games and the pleasure 
of playing in a beautiful casino where there is no wait for a table are sure to 
attract players, they said. 
</P>
<P>
A customer who declined to give his name agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a beautiful place, much better than the other two (the Bicycle Club and 
the Commerce Club)," he said. "Because it's small, they even know you by name. 
They treat you like family." 
</P>
<P>
Said Soh: "There is a sign of progress every day."

BIGGEST LESSON IN MUSIC WAS LEARNING TO COPE; 
</P>
<P>
UNIVERSITY: THE BAND, ORCHESTRA AND ENSEMBLES WERE DISPLACED AND OUT OF SYNC 
SINCE THE RECITAL HALL ROOF COLLAPSE.

<P>
The 350 music majors at Cal State Long Beach finished final exams last week in 
courses ranging from music theory to opera performance, but the most difficult 
lessons of the semester had nothing to do with music. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to run all over campus for classes," said sophomore Angela Parrish of 
Downey. "It really ruined my focus." 
</P>
<P>
For Parrish and her classmates, fall semester meant coping with the bizarre 
roof collapse in July of the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall. No one was injured 
in the incident, but it left much of the eight-year-old structure in ruins and 
prompted the closure of several buildings in the music complex because of 
safety concerns. 
</P>
<P>
The events forced the music department to put together an academic program 
without some of its most treasured facilities. The results were at times taxing 
and unconventional. For example: 
</P>
<P>
* The 60-student symphonic band, the 80-student orchestra and the 65-student 
wind symphony held regular rehearsals in a closed fitness club at the Marina 
Pacifica shopping mall. They moved to the former Nautilus Club after a short 
stint at the Universalist Unitarian Church, where the musicians complained 
about poor acoustics. They may have to move again next semester because of 
concerns about liability insurance. 
</P>
<P>
* The music department, which received an extra $40,000 this fall from the 
university for equipment rentals, leases and other unexpected expenses, saw 
revenue from recitals and performances drop by about one-third during the fall 
semester. The decrease of about $10,000 may force the department to cut some 
student scholarships next semester. "That is a real problem for us," said 
department head Donald Para. 
</P>
<P>
* Opera students settled last month into the Queen's Salon aboard the Queen 
Mary for a performance of Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte," originally scheduled for 
the collapsed recital hall. Although the unusual location attracted attention, 
the performance lost money because the ship could accommodate only 150 people, 
about half the capacity of the recital hall. 
</P>
<P>
* A regular stream of students held recitals at the Long Beach Public Library 
as well as at a host of churches across town, but in many cases, tickets were 
not even printed because it was too difficult to keep track of the changing 
venues. 
</P>
<P>
* Comedian and musician Dudley Moore held a benefit concert at the university 
in October to raise money to replace two Steinway pianos destroyed when the 
recital hall roof collapsed. The benefit raised $13,000, but even Moore 
encountered unexpected problems when a string broke on a Steinway borrowed for 
his performance. 
</P>
<P>
"All in all, we survived pretty well," said Para, taking stock of the semester 
last week. "We took the attitude when everything started that you just do what 
you have to do. You decide that you are not going to give in to it, that you 
are going to run a program, you are going to find a way to teach and make art, 
and then you do it." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Friedman, a junior French horn student from Irvine, said most students 
learned to make the best of a trying situation. In fact, university officials 
said, enrollment is up over previous years. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a crazy semester, but nothing we couldn't handle," Friedman said. 
"It was actually great to play on the Queen Mary." 
</P>
<P>
In a report last week to the California State University chancellor's office, 
investigators concluded that the roof collapse was caused by a combination of 
design, construction and maintenance problems. Cal State officials said they 
were optimistic that an agreement can be reached among the architect, 
contractor, roof manufacturer and the university to rebuild the recital hall 
and repair the other buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"My great objective is to get the buildings back in place, safe and sound, and 
students in them," said Cal State Long Beach President Curtis McCray. 
"Distributing the costs is going to be the question. First thing we have to do 
is discover what needs to be done, then establish the cost, and then how do we 
all ante up." 
</P>
<P>
Cal State Long Beach spokeswoman Toni Beron said that three of the six closed 
buildings in the music complex may be repaired by the end of January, in time 
for the start of spring semester. Work on the recital hall and two other 
problem-ridden buildings, however, is not expected to be completed until next 
fall -- at the earliest. Several music professors said they are not planning on 
the recital hall reopening until the fall of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
"It has all of us a little depressed -- the fact that nothing is happening too 
fast," said Prof. Justus Matthews. 
</P>
<P>
For students and faculty, the collapsed roof and closed classrooms meant 
juggling the routine demands of academia with previously unimaginable problems 
of logistics. Matthews spent $650 of the $800 allocated this fall for the 
department's New Music Ensemble to move five pianos from one end of the campus 
to the other for a concert. The money is typically used to hire professional 
musicians to perform with the ensemble, Matthews said. 
</P>
<P>
Many classes were also moved across campus -- a brisk 10-minute walk, sometimes 
with musical instruments in tow -- to rooms loaned by other departments. To 
help students decipher the changes, the department distributed a two-page 
schedule of courses that listed "old room" and "new room" assignments. A campus 
map was also posted on the department bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
But even with the navigational aids, a lack of parking sometimes turned simple 
tasks, such as using temporary classrooms, into monumental assignments. "It 
seemed like you had to park miles and miles away," said graduate student Ron 
Anderson of Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
Some students, however, got an extra bonus from the scheduling changes. 
Assistant Prof. Martin Herman moved his electronic music course to the film and 
television department, giving his students the unusual opportunity to write 
scores for films being produced by other students. Herman said he hopes to make 
the collaboration a permanent part of the course. 
</P>
<P>
"That (film) department is about the farthest place from the music complex that 
you could be," Martin said, "but that is where the music department used to be 
before they built the music complex. It was kind of like a homecoming." 
</P>
<P>
Para, the deparment head, said the search for temporary classrooms and 
performance sites for next semester is already under way. Through it all, he 
said, faculty and students have kept in mind that things could be much worse. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just thankful that nobody got hurt," he said.

the building, music classes were scattered in various other buildings on and 
off campus. KAREN TAPIA / Los Angeles Times; Photo, SCHOOL'S OUT: Fall semester 
ended last week at Cal State Long Beach, but nowhere was the feeling of relief 
greater than in the music department. Students and faculty spent much of the 
semester learning to cope -- for better or worse -- without use of the Gerald 
R. Daniel Recital Hall. The collapsed building is fenced off, above, with 
strict warnings to keep away.

Tis that time of year for: Rows of houses drenched with blinking lights of all 
colors. Rooftops loaded with Santas on sleighs -- or surfboards. Yards filled 
with motorized toys that sing or dance or fly. Streets packed with creeping 
cars of gawkers. 
</P>
<P>
Elaborate Christmas displays have blossomed in neighborhoods throughout the 
Southeast. Here are but a few examples: 
</P>
<P>
* Long Beach: The upper-scale Naples area is saturated with brightly lit houses 
and exotic displays along the Rivo Alto Canal. From 2nd Street on Naples 
Island, turn toward the ocean a few blocks and find a place to park. This 
neighborhood is best viewed on foot from the sidewalks along both sides of the 
canal. It makes a big loop and can be a long walk if you want to see it all. 
Wear comfortable shoes and dress warmly at night. 
</P>
<P>
* Cerritos: Thirty homes on Castle Place and Kings Row Avenue in Cerritos are 
decorated as a group with brilliant displays of lights and Christmas scenes. 
The neighborhood is so popular among sightseers that sheriff's deputies have 
created a special traffic lane on westbound South Street in the vicinity of the 
San Gabriel River to direct the flow of cars in a continuous pattern through 
the two streets. 
</P>
<P>
* Commerce: A group of homes on Boris Avenue and Bartmus Street alongside the 
Santa Ana Freeway (I-5) are decked out with lights for the holidays. From the 
northbound I-5 use Washington Boulevard exit, right on Telegraph Road, right on 
Washington under the freeway, right on Fidelia Avenue, right on Jillson Street, 
left on Boris and left on Bartmus. 
</P>
<P>
* Downey: The city's traditional Nativity scene, featuring life-size figures 
and animals, is at the First Baptist Church of Downey, 8348 E. 3rd St., (near 
City Hall). The Nativity scene, sponsored by the Downey Christmas Assn., a 
private organization, was moved from City Hall after a Superior Court ruled 
earlier this year that such a display on city property "conveys a message of 
endorsement of religion in violation of the (Constitution)." 
</P>
<P>
* Whittier: Several homes in the 6000 block of Acacia Street have been 
decorated to the hilt. From the 605 Freeway, take the Whittier Boulevard exit, 
Whittier Boulevard to Magnolia Avenue, north on Magnolia to Broadway Road, east 
to Acacia, then turn left.

Shen Tong was at home in central Beijing, just footsteps from the stretch of 
Changan Avenue that would see the heaviest casualties, when the shooting began 
on the night of June 3, 1989. For a moment, like many others, he assumed that 
the soldiers spraying gunfire were using rubber bullets. Then came the 
intolerable recognition. "People who had been hit fell to the ground and lay 
still. 'Those people are dead,' I thought to myself. 'The bullets are real.' I 
couldn't believe it. It was as if this were all happening in a dream." 
</P>
<P>
Shen Tong's impulsive response was to reason with the soldiers, one of whom 
seemed barely 18 and disoriented. " 'You are on Changan Avenue. Do you know the 
history of Changan Avenue? . . . You are the People's Liberation Army and 
you're shooting your own people.' " An uncle interrupted his final effort at 
dialogue and dragged Shen Tong away. Then a shot rang out from the officer's 
pistol that seconds before had pointed at him. Shen Tong looked back to see the 
girl who had stood beside him lying on the ground, a bloody hole where her face 
had been. 
</P>
<P>
Within days, Shen Tong was in the United States, his escape route necessarily 
undisclosed. He began classes at Brandeis University in a daze. "I was free, 
but I longed for home almost like a sickness." Writing "Almost a Revolution," 
with the help of Washington Post reporter Marianne Yen, provided one means of 
expiating his grief and also of bearing witness to those left behind, the 
countless students, workers and ordinary citizens who had similarly risked 
their lives only to face months of fear and the threat of reprisals. 
</P>
<P>
Shen Tong's gripping account of the tense but exhilarating 56 days that 
preceded the democracy movement's bloody suppression takes us behind the scenes 
of angry protesters and gaunt hunger strikes captured by Western television 
cameras. The story is one of heroism but also of discord and disarray. 
</P>
<P>
As head of the Dialogue Delegation attempting to wrest concessions from 
Communist Party leaders, Shen Tong was central to the struggle that would 
determine China's fate. He was at the same time a college junior, not yet 21, 
uncertain of his own judgment, unable to achieve a consensus with a shifting 
cast of student leaders, and under constant pressure from his parents to leave 
for the safety of study abroad. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic denouement of China's democracy spring has produced numerous 
eyewitness reports but none as yet by a key student leader. "Almost a 
Revolution" is compelling not just because of Shen Tong's inside knowledge of 
the movement and its discontents but also because of its autobiographical 
candor. 
</P>
<P>
Liu Binyan's "China's Crisis, China's Hope: Essays from an Intellectual in 
Exile," translated with characteristic grace and skill by Howard Goldblatt, 
probes the roots rather than the unfolding of the 1989 democracy movement. 
Forty years ago, Liu participated enthusiastically in the student movement that 
led to the founding of the People's Republic. He eagerly joined the Communist 
Party but refused to abandon his spirit of independent inquiry. Such failure to 
conform to officially established modes of thought was anathema to the 
revolution's leaders who, once in power, replaced the glowing ideals of a 
promised "new democracy" with the repressive practices of a "democratic 
dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
Branded an enemy of the people and expelled from the party in 1957, Liu was 
sent to the countryside to reform himself through physical labor. Two decades 
of persecution followed, but when political verdicts were reversed and 
intellectuals rehabilitated in 1978, Liu was made a special correspondent for 
the official mouthpiece, People's Daily. 
</P>
<P>
His bold investigative reporting revealed abuses of power, inspiring readers 
long accustomed to a press that concealed the arrogance, corruption and 
mismanagement of their leaders. In 1987, Liu again was dismissed from the 
Communist Party, and a year later, he arrived in the United States, the door to 
his homeland closed as tightly to him as to those like Shen Tong who fled in 
the wake of the Tian An Men suppression. 
</P>
<P>
The publication of his essays, originally delivered as lectures at Harvard 
University in 1988-89, prompts a reexamination for the post-Mao decade. During 
the same years that scholars, businessmen and tourists from the West were 
applauding China's discovery of the capitalist road, economic and social 
problems spread with alarming speed. Inflation, corruption, unemployment, 
bureaucratic profiteering, the destruction of the natural environment, the 
pressure of an insupportable population and the disappearance of any shared 
moral values had all become apparent by 1983, he asserts, and pervasive by 
1985. This created a "puzzlement, pessimism and indignation felt by people all 
over China . . . a phenomenon very much worth examining, for it is 
unprecedented in recent Chinese history -- never have I seen this sort of 
despair." 
</P>
<P>
Out of such despair, Liu Binyan argued presciently in 1988, would appear the 
seeds of hope. His description of the discontent that finally triggered 
democracy demonstrations in more than 80 cities in 1983 resonates poignantly in 
the midst of the post-Tian An Men repression. "They believe they are powerless 
to improve the state of affairs or to exert any influence; they are helpless, 
their hands are tied. The natural consequence of this state of helplessness is 
that great numbers of people have sunk into despondence. But it can also be a 
call to action for other people to reform the system." 
</P>
<P>
"The life expectancy of this government cannot be long," he asserts in "Deng's 
Pyrrhic Victory," one of two essays written after the Tian An Men tragedy. 
"Party Central has found out that in nearly all its subordinate organs, party 
cadres are covering up for activists in the democracy movement. As the leaders' 
impotence has become manifest, they find fewer and fewer people to trust, and 
they are resorting to increasingly fascist methods." 
</P>
<P>
To expose Americans' persistent and willful ignorance of the Chinese Communist 
Party's fascist methods is Steven W. Mosher's purpose in "China Misperceived: 
American Illusions and Chinese Reality." For him as for Liu Binyan, the Tian An 
Men tragedy confirms widespread "disaffection from the Communist system that 
Mao had midwived." Otherwise, this ambitious and perhaps intentionally abrasive 
survey of American attitudes toward China shares little common ground with the 
books described above. In fact, Mosher's insightful catalogue of errors seems 
as much the product of personal pique as of scholarly acumen. 
</P>
<P>
The reason is not difficult to fathom. "China Misperceived" presents Mosher's 
answer to the academic and journalistic community that spurned him. Criticized 
in 1979 by the Chinese government for professional misconduct during a year of 
anthropological field work, he then was investigated by Stanford University and 
ultimately denied a Ph.D. degree. The insult has not been forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
Mosher contends that from the time of the Nixon visit in 1972 and throughout 
the 1980s, scholars and journalists, businessmen and tourists were gulled by 
the Communist Party's stagecraft into a "charitable reading" of the Beijing 
regime. Having recognized the true face of Chinese Communism himself long 
before 1989, he cannot conceal his derision at those who discovered only after 
the democracy movement's suppression that party leaders were capable of cruelty 
and terror. 
</P>
<P>
American reporters flocked to Beijing, he explains, and then, "from the 
sanctuary of their hotels," described events in the streets as a blood bath and 
a slaughter "without on-the-scene confirmation." This "sudden eagerness to 
believe the worst of Beijing" shows that "the American media had switched 
sides; or rather, it had discovered there was another side." Mosher's contempt 
for such naivete is searing. The destruction of the " 'fantasy world' that had 
been home to a large and flourishing population of China-watchers before the 
massacre" is long overdue, he writes. 
</P>
<P>
Mosher has contributed importantly to an understanding of the pendulum swings 
in "America's intense and long-running emotional involvement with China." 
However, his book is less successful in illuminating what he broadly terms 
Chinese reality. The "revolt of the Red Guards," to take one example, is 
dispensed with in two pages of generalizations about the decade-long Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
Mosher asserts at the outset that "the observer who recognizes and declares his 
viewpoint up front is likely to produce a more unbiased account than someone 
whose own position goes unstated." However, it is the substantiation of his own 
guiding belief in the malevolence of communism, not the clarification of 
historical inaccuracies, that seems Mosher's abiding goal. Thus while he 
usefully unveils "the scholarly pettifoggery to which the absence of reliable 
data about China drove even widely respected Sinologists," one cannot but think 
that he may someday want to glance in his own mirror.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a scene from the Oscar-winning "Cinema Paradiso," a young boy is frantically 
pedaling his bicycle between two small towns in pre-World War II Sicily 
carrying reels of film back and forth so audiences in the two villages can 
watch the same movie at about the same time. 
</P>
<P>
The scene is one among many that writer-director Giuseppe Tornatore uses to 
create a nostalgia for old-time moviegoing, and while the era he re-creates is 
as musty as your grandfather's stamp collection, the scene serves just as well 
to illustrate how little film exhibition has really changed. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the historical milestones of "talkies," color, wide-screen processes 
and stereo, surround and digital sound, films are essentially shown the same 
way as they were 70 years ago. Motion picture images are still imprinted on 
sprocket-holed celluloid strips, delivered to theaters in bulky canisters and 
run through projectors at 24 frames per second. 
</P>
<P>
But, according to most experts, all that is about to change -- dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
By the year 2005, maybe sooner, movies will almost certainly be delivered to 
screens -- in both theaters and at home -- electronically. Engineers' eyes 
light up and spit sparks when they discuss the possibilities ahead: 
high-definition television, satellite transmissions, fiber optics and digital 
reproduction, and they swear on a stack of megabytes that the video revolution 
of the '80s is a molehill compared to the technological mountain to be scaled 
in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody knows exactly what the changes will be -- or which will become the 
industry standards -- but this much is clear: As Hollywood continues to make 
the kinds of movies the world loves, the companies in the best position to 
exploit the new technology will lead the global entertainment industry into the 
21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Who best understands the coming revolution and what it means to the movie 
business? Well, the Japanese seem to understand it very, very well. They 
should, because they are the world leaders in coming up with the technology 
that's going to change everything. That's one reason Sony plopped down $3.4 
billion to buy Columbia Pictures last year, and why Matsushita Electric 
Industrial Co. is now buying MCA, owner of Universal Studios, for a whopping 
$6.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
And there's at least one company in Korea that seems to have an inkling about 
it: Samsung, one of the world's largest corporations, apparently sized up Orion 
Pictures recently before deciding not to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood, whose dream merchants sleep through most revolutions, is beginning 
to recognize it, too. Technology committees have sprung up at several studios, 
and just last year, the industry at large agreed to fund and participate in an 
international group called the Technology Foundation of the Motion 
Picture/Television Industry. 
</P>
<P>
But the studios lag woefully behind in both research and visionary leadership. 
The film business here has traditionally been run on short-term objectives, and 
though its dominance as the world's supplier of filmed entertainment is 
unquestioned, its failure to seize the day when television and then video came 
along assured it a subsidiary role in the current high-stakes media shakeout. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese, culturally, take a longer view of things, while America is 
young, rambunctious, short-sighted," says special-effects wizard Richard 
Edlund, who is president of Marina del Rey-based Boss Film Studios. "Their 
arrival in Hollywood will force us to think." 
</P>
<P>
"Hardware," "software" and "synergy" are the buzzwords of the 
Japanese-Hollywood story. The Japanese dominate the hardware market (TV sets, 
VCRs, stereo and other home-entertainment equipment) while Hollywood has the 
software (movies, TV programs, musical recordings). Owning both gives them the 
synergy -- the corporate version of hybrid vigor -- to add up to more than the 
sum of their parts. 
</P>
<P>
Is that why the Japanese paid what looked like Neiman-Marcus prices for 
Columbia and MCA? In part, yes. By controlling movies and TV programming, 
experts say, the Japanese can better influence the direction of entertainment 
technology. (Matsushita, for example, could give laser-disc players a big boost 
by releasing Universal movies in that format.) 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the only reason behind the Japanese interest in Hollywood: 
Experts say that, with the coming entertainment revolution, the values of 
studio libraries will skyrocket, making the MCA and Columbia deals look like 
bargains in retrospect. 
</P>
<P>
The technology driving that revolution won't be cheap. To persuade consumers to 
buy the hardware, they have to make sure there are plenty of good things to put 
in them. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese know that you can't sell a $3,000 high-definition TV set unless 
there's a sufficient number of movies, cassettes or laser discs available for 
the damn thing," says Douglas Trumbull, president of Berkshire Motion Picture 
and the creator of visual effects for "2001: A Space Odyssey." "The acquisition 
of Columbia and MCA creates a critical mass for them." 
</P>
<P>
The reactions to the Japanese landing in Hollywood has been either serious 
hand-wringing -- over the export of profits and the fear of censorship -- or a 
sanguine acceptance of economic one-upmanship in a free-enterprise system 
without boundaries. Yet few people have raised the questions of the long-term 
objectives of the Japanese and the potential impact of their control on 
consumers. Since the Hollywood Establishment is unskilled at looking ahead, 
this article examines those issues from the standpoint of the technology 
looming just ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Technological sluggishness wasn't always the American way in entertainment. It 
was the Americans, primarily through RCA, who introduced color TV to the world. 
The Japanese -- specialists at refinement -- took it and ran with it, becoming 
the acknowledged masters of the medium. Hollywood movie studios, too, were once 
in the forefront, with their own projection and camera departments in 
competition to introduce such improvements as Stereosound and Vistavision. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology was once an integral part of studio competition," says Trumbull, 
"but since the 1948 consent decree that forbade studios to own theaters, the 
focus has been on product, creating vehicles for talent. The question of what 
medium to put them in is of absolutely no consequence. The movie business has 
shot itself in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
The disbanding in the mid-'50s of the Motion Picture Research Council, a 
studio-funded committee that coordinated technological development, may have 
been the final cut that left Hollywood, in Richard Edlund's words, "a 
technological headless horseman." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem, Edlund adds, is the lack of continuity here. "Running a 
studio has become a game of musical chairs. The Japanese companies are very 
conservative, they move very deliberately. But once they make up their minds, 
they really get on it." 
</P>
<P>
The sale of MCA-Universal, leaving four of the town's seven major movie studios 
in foreign hands, has raised some non-technological issues as well. Reflecting 
a widespread wariness about having an occupying army in our cultural front 
yard, Variety blared a Japanese headline, translated "Buyer Beware." Around 
town, filmmakers nervously assessed Matsushita president Akio Tanii's 
reluctance to assure them he wouldn't meddle in creative matters. 
</P>
<P>
Those concerns are not unfounded. Two years ago, Bernardo Bertolucci's "The 
Last Emperor" opened in Japanese theaters only after the portrayal of Japan's 
bloody 1937 raid on Nanjing was excised. Other films critical of Japanese 
culture have never been seen there. As Patrick O'Heffernan, director of Georgia 
Institute for Technology's Center for International Strategy, put it: "We revel 
in skewering our sacred cows. The Japanese honor their sacred cows. Will that 
lead to censorship? I don't think so. But it will be one more step in the 
process where some movies don't get made." 
</P>
<P>
O'Heffernan and others also express concern that the Japanese owners will be 
even more big-hit and bottom-line oriented than the Americans. But the larger 
issue, argues O'Heffernan, is that the U.S. is losing control of the exports -- 
our media and culture -- that have made the American way of life so influential 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Some Hollywood insiders, however, don't expect those exports to look any 
different under Japanese ownership. "The Japanese aren't going to try to decide 
for people what pictures they should see," says David Geffen, who became a 
leading stockholder in MCA when he sold Geffen Records to the studio last 
March, and who stands to make an additional $180 million when the Matsushita 
deal is completed. "David Puttnam was disastrously unsuccessful when he tried 
to do that at Columbia. If the Japanese try to affect things, they will have 
lost their investment because the talent will pick up its bags and go 
elsewhere. Hollywood is one of the few places (where) the assets go home at 
night." 
</P>
<P>
But the focus on what movies two Japanese-owned studios might or might not make 
obscures an even bigger story: Whatever shape the coming film technology 
revolution takes, it will be the people who build those black boxes in your 
home -- as much as the people who produce TV shows and movies -- who determine 
the range of options available to audiences. 
</P>
<P>
For the vast majority of movie fans, the important question in all this is, 
what's in it for us? When the new technologies are out of the lab, will there 
be more and better movies to choose from and more convenient ways to view them, 
or will Hollywood merely recycle the formula-blockbuster mentality of the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
You can start a fight taking either position, but certainly, technology has the 
potential to increase choice by revolutionizing both the production and 
distribution of movies. On the production side, new technologies could give 
filmmakers outside the mainstream low-cost ways to make movies of sufficient 
technical quality to attract large audiences. 
</P>
<P>
"Technology in most other areas has lowered the barriers to producing product," 
says Jonathan Seybold, a pioneer in desktop publishing whose Malibu company 
publishes high-tech newsletters and sponsors seminars. "It happened in 
printing, and now it's happening in music very clearly. My neighbor is an 
Oscar-winning composer who can put together digitally (on his home computer) a 
whole film score. He has more artistic control at a fraction of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
"Those tendencies are the best counterbalance I can think of to the increasing 
concentration of media companies. I would hope the same thing would happen in 
movies, too. I would love to have more Wayne Wangs and Spike Lees doing 
interesting, low-budget films." 
</P>
<P>
But the real revolution, many say, will come not in the production of films but 
in their distribution. Movie theaters will be swept along on the tide of 
change, but by all accounts, the focus of the new technological race will be 
the home -- transformed into a multimedia, interactive entertainment center 
through the marriage of computers and film. People will be able to pick up the 
fiber-optic phone line, access any listing, say, in the Paramount or ABC 
libraries, punch in a code and, within minutes, have "Singin' in the Rain" or a 
documentary on civil-rights violations flash across a wall-sized, 
high-definition screen. 
</P>
<P>
The multimedia possibilities are unlimited. "Your 10-year-old son is doing a 
paper on Martin Luther King," says Scott Ross, general manager of LucasArts' 
Industrial Light &amp; Magic. "(With this technology) he dials the NBC library 
to pull film of King's 'I Have a Dream' speech. Once you can complete the 
relationship of the computer and the TV set, it will blow apart the 
(conventional) concept of entertainment and media." 
</P>
<P>
All for a fee, of course. Billing will also be streamlined, with the charges 
reflected on your telephone statements. The phone companies stand to make a 
mint carrying all this new information over their wires. (Some experts believe 
that is one motive behind AT&amp;T's recent bid for NCR Corp., the nation's 
fifth-largest computer maker.) 
</P>
<P>
"The video, feature film, and computer industries have traditionally been very 
separate," says Robert Greenberg, president of R/Greenberg Associates, which 
specializes in special effects and computer-generated imagery, "but now they're 
talking the same language as it relates to images and sound. The common 
denominator is digital control." 
</P>
<P>
"Digital" -- the conversion of sounds and images to electronic bits -- will 
open the door to interactive TV, to mass data storage, to the duplication of 
sound and images without loss of quality from one generation to the next. One 
expert foresees a vending machine that would stamp out films on videodiscs 
while you wait. 
</P>
<P>
Digital processing is also the key to compressing information into fiber optic 
phone lines, which will bring the movie into the home. The American 
fiber-optics system, though nowhere near as far along as the Japanese 
equivalent, is under way. Though the main branches are in place, home hookups 
-- slowed down by the breakup of AT&amp;T -- are 15 or 20 years down the road. 
"Laying the lines to deal with this volume of information," says Greenberg, "is 
like trying to build a mass transit system in L.A. -- a pretty difficult feat." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the incentive is there, for creators as well as consumers. "Independent 
film producers could buy space on the fiber-optic cable," says Trumbull, "and 
get their film to millions in one night. That provides them with an instant 
return on their investment." 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Lippman, associate director of MIT's Media Laboratory, notes that the 
use of computers will enable studios to tailor their movies to different 
audiences. "You can individualize things: changing content, transferring it to 
different languages, even changing gestures to suit individual countries," he 
says. "You could produce 10 versions of a movie with options built in to 
broaden interest." 
</P>
<P>
More and more, the studios will also be using computers to generate special 
effects, landscapes, even people and animals such as the digitally created 
water snake that appeared in last year's underwater adventure movie "The 
Abyss." And the days of cut-and-paste editing of 35mm film are almost surely 
coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to capture information in front of the lens and put it on a 
digital record," says Marty Katz, Disney's executive vice president of motion 
picture and television production and founder of its two-year-old Technology 
Committee. "The camera will electronically indicate which takes are good and 
transmit them to the lab. Film can then be edited electronically and the 
finished picture beamed via satellite into the home. It will revolutionize the 
way film is processed, edited and distributed." 
</P>
<P>
These changes in both production and viewing are bringing the computer and 
consumer electronics industries closer together, raising this question: Does 
your TV become your computer, or does your computer become your TV? The answer 
has huge implications for global competition, because the Americans dominate 
the computer arena while the Japanese drive the consumer electronics industry, 
particularly in the area of HDTV. By multiplying the number of lines of 
resolution on your TV picture, HDTV boasts a theater-quality image and couples 
it with CD-quality stereo sound. 
</P>
<P>
But getting HDTV into American homes will require massive investment in 
equipment by broadcasters and a consumer changeover at home. Though Sony has 
already sold the first HDTV sets in Japan, for about $18,000 each, the U.S. is 
faced with a Catch-22: Broadcasters don't want to convert to HDTV until 
consumers have the sets, and consumers won't want to buy sets until there is 
plenty of HDTV programming to receive. 
</P>
<P>
There are other problems. For one, many U.S. companies and lawmakers see the 
potential HDTV market as the linchpin of American competitiveness and are loath 
to hand it over to Japan. Several legislators have called for federal funding 
of research efforts. Others believe that the U.S. should sit out HDTV -- where 
the Japanese have the clear advantage -- and await the development of fully 
digital television, which many experts believe is the next technology of 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
While the HDTV debate continues in Congress, the Federal Communications 
Commission is going forward with a testing program and says it will adopt an 
American HDTV standard in 1993, creating, in all probability, three different 
standards worldwide -- ours, Japan's and Europe's. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately for us, HDTV is blessed with a few major problems," says Jeorg 
Agin, general manager of Kodak's motion picture and television markets 
division, which is developing its own high-resolution system with nearly twice 
the lines offered by HDTV. "The world has yet to settle on a standard. There's 
little library of software available. CBS isn't about to put out material in 
that format if there's no one out there to receive it. And who's going to 
advertise in such a limited system or invest in a technology that may soon be 
obsolete?" 
</P>
<P>
Sony, meanwhile, is quietly pushing HDTV through its Hollywood toehold. At 
Sony's Columbia Pictures headquarters in Culver City, John Galt, a director at 
Sony High Definition Facilities, is researching ways to use "high-definition 
processes" (he cringes at the word video) in film production, often combining 
the technology with computers and animation techniques. On a screen in a 
chilly, computer-laden room, a camera pans across a room full of toys, past a 
long-haired cat who looks like he could fall off the screen and into your lap, 
landing on . . . John Galt. Zip! Galt shrinks. Zap! He's in a Lego helicopter 
and flying across the room, a miniature pilot in a room full of life-size Teddy 
bears. This technology, Galt says, would have made Disney's "Honey, I Shrunk 
the Kids" almost a snap to produce. (Disney has expressed keen interest in the 
technology.) 
</P>
<P>
No one expects filmmakers in the near term to shoot feature films in 
high-definition video; it still lacks the rich texture and clarity of 35mm 
film. A couple of feature films have been made in high-definition video, 
including one ("Julia and Julia") that starred Kathleen Turner. But watching 
them, even after they've been transferred to film and projected on a normal 
screen, is more like watching a daytime TV drama than a movie. Few people 
believe that "look" is the future of motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Sony has stopped talking about the advantages of shooting movies on 
high-definition video and instead is peddling the technology for use in 
post-production, insisting it will save time and money and actually aid in 
optical and special-effects work. Observers say Sony is betting that if it can 
get filmmakers to accept HDTV at any level, it will have a leg up on its 
hardware competitors. 
</P>
<P>
Sony and Matsushita can push their own HDTV technologies another way, some 
analysts say. By converting the films in their libraries to high-definition 
video, they can sell HDTV sets on which to play those films, thus providing 
competition to broadcasters reluctant to adopt HDTV programming. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, says MIT's Lippman, the value of the movies themselves will 
skyrocket given the privatization of European broadcast stations, greater 
at-home access and the possibility of packing more and more programming on 
satellites through digital compression. "The studio library is of tremendous 
value in itself," he says. "It ain't an HDTV issue." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the advantages of all these new technologies, most experts say it's 
unlikely that they will reduce budgets on major studio movies (the average now 
costs about $25 million) or call the dominance of the studios into question. It 
takes lots of capital to pay superstar salaries and to fund the large-scale 
marketing essential to a hit. Decentralization or not, insiders insist, 
Hollywood is unlikely to change its ways. 
</P>
<P>
"In the end, technology doesn't matter," says Tom Pollock, chairman of 
MCA-Universal's motion picture group. "You have to make films people want to 
see. The business will always be hit-driven. It won't change -- ever, ever, 
ever." 
</P>
<P>
Will people stop going to movie theaters when all these electronic marvels are 
in their homes? No one can say for sure -- in 10 years, you might be able to 
punch a button on your remote control and fill your TV room with holographic 
buddies -- but the urge to get out and see a movie with strangers has survived 
every other technological convenience. 
</P>
<P>
But to withstand the next wave, theaters will undergo their own revolution. 
Last week, Jameson Entertainment Group and Ikegami Electronics unveiled plans 
to build theater multiplexes that will project movies from high-definition 
laser discs. The multiplexes also will be equipped to screen television 
programming, sporting events, business conferences and educational seminars via 
satellite -- moving Hollywood one step closer to the day when feature films, 
too, can be bounced off satellites and into theaters. 
</P>
<P>
"What I foresee is a differentiation emerging between what you see at home and 
what you see in the theaters," predicts Trumbull, "a line drawn between 
special-effects spectacles that use wide screens and stereo sound, and the more 
intimate films such as 'sex, lies and videotape' (which people will watch at 
home). The market will dwindle to fewer but larger screens showing spectacular 
epics to justify the $8, $10, $12 ticket prices." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever improvements are made, they will most likely come at the nudging of 
the studios rather than on the initiative of the notoriously cost-conscious 
theater owners. Trumbull, whose 65mm Showscan high-speed photographic and 
projection system met with opposition from those unwilling to foot the cost of 
new equipment, says he's not holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
"I poured $35 million into Showscan and showed it to every theater chain, every 
studio head, all the unions," he says. "The response was uniformly positive. I 
had hoped it would restore some of the grandeur to a movie business that had 
been multiplexed to death. The rub was that no one was willing to use it. I 
left the industry four years ago in abject disappointment . . . This business 
doesn't take technology seriously." 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that filmmaking is a collaborative art form," says Greenberg. 
"You can't throw in a new technology and expect it to be immediately embraced." 
</P>
<P>
Still, strides are being made. Disney recently introduced digital, CD-quality 
sound on 15 of its "Dick Tracy" prints, and would have done more if more 
theaters were equipped to use it. And the studio is experimenting with a "3-D" 
sound system, which could provide the chug of a train, for instance, passing 
behind the viewer and out the theater doors. Also in development are motion 
simulators like those used in Disneyland's Star Tours attraction, which would 
make it possible for viewers to sit in a theater seat and feel as if they're on 
the speed bike with Luke and Leia during the forest scene in "Return of the 
Jedi." 
</P>
<P>
The potential technology out there is raising a variety of questions at home. 
Will industry players move in concert with the best systems, or will they get 
into a winner-take-all battle, like the one Sony and Matsushita had over 
videocassette standards? With interactive TV, will the industry push even 
harder on market research? "Studios will know not just who's watching a movie, 
but how old they are and where they live," says ILM's Ross. "The business will 
undoubtedly become even more demographically oriented." 
</P>
<P>
Analysts worry that the cost of starting up the new technology and converting 
libraries may exceed potential revenues, and that the public will tune out on 
hype that may sound like a technological Tower of Babel. Still, the revolution 
will come, and people with the vision to look ahead are seeing green. 
</P>
<P>
"The ultimate dream machine for all studios is the same: A mechanism by which 
any individual, at the time of his choosing, can order a film without leaving 
home," says one high-powered studio executive. "That's the ultimate dream for 
the film owner -- to market material to the consumer without a middleman." 
</P>
<P>
For all the talk of East-West rivalry, there's general agreement that 
cooperation is the only practical road, long-term. The Japanese are financing 
Edlund's upcoming feature "Solar Crisis," for which he is developing new 
digital techniques; Disney has a $600-million line of credit with the Japanese; 
and JVC has invested $100 million in equity and credit advances in producer 
Lawrence Gordon's Largo Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's 'old-think' to have a U.S. vs. Japan attitude," says MIT's Lippman. 
"Without international cooperation, it will be impossible to distribute a 
program worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
Still, some analysts continue to worry that the U.S. is ceding Japan power not 
only over ephemeral cultural resources but over concrete decisions on which 
technologies will dominate the lucrative entertainment industry over the next 
decades, and the pace at which they will be introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"Until now the global media revolution has been a U.S. revolution," says 
Georgia Tech's O'Heffernan. "Global media is U.S.-based. We had the opportunity 
to set the course. Instead, we're selling it."

STEALING TIME WITH RICHARD STARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE BLOCK, Block's latest novel is A Ticket to the Boneyard ( William 
Morrow). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few weeks ago I came home carrying a stack of 20 paperback books. "What have 
you got there?" my wife asked me, and answered the question herself by 
shuffling through the books. " 'Richard Stark.' 'Richard Stark.' 'Donald E. 
Westlake as Richard Stark.' These are Don's books about. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Parker," I supplied. "I'm doing a piece. So I figured I'd better read them." 
</P>
<P>
"You read them when they came out," she said, "and you were rereading some of 
them a few years ago." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, yeah," I said. "I've reread all of them at one time or another, but in a 
casual way. Now I want to go through them in sequence." 
</P>
<P>
"How many are there?" 
</P>
<P>
"Sixteen about Parker," I said, "and four about Grofield." 
</P>
<P>
"He's a friend of Parker's?" 
</P>
<P>
"Parker doesn't exactly have friends. But yeah, sort of." 
</P>
<P>
She frowned in thought. "So you're going to read 20 books in order to write a 
short piece about them? Couldn't you just write it off the top of your head? As 
familiar as you are with the books. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"Impossible," I said. "You don't know the first thing about it." 
</P>
<P>
Parker is a thief. Like Willie Sutton, he goes where the money is, taking off 
banks and armored cars and payrolls and concert receipts. In his first 
appearance, in "The Hunter" (a.k.a. "Point Blank"), he goes after the 
confederate who double-crossed him and left him for dead. In so doing he 
alienates organized crime, so in "The Man With the Getaway Face" he undergoes 
plastic surgery, and in "The Outfit" he extorts from the crime syndicate the 
money he feels they owe him. In the books that follow, he knocks over a whole 
town in North Dakota, a coin convention in Indianapolis, an Air Force Base in 
Upstate New York. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
The books are as classically constructed as symphonies. Indeed, each has four 
movements. The first two sections are told from Parker's point of view. The 
third section -- the scherzo? -- has each of its chapters focused in turn upon 
one of the subsidiary characters. Then, in the fourth section, we once again 
see the story through Parker's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
And the plots, like the structure, run to a pattern. Parker is a planner, an 
organizer, and he plans a heist, and it is carried out. Then something goes 
wrong, and then Parker does what he can to set it right. When he's not working, 
Parker lives in resort hotels and has sex all the time. When he's working, he's 
not interested in sex -- or, indeed, in much of anything else. He's incapable 
of small talk. When he wants to think, he watches television with the sound 
off, or sits in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
He is, it would seem, a two-dimensional character caught up in unvarying 
variations on a theme. Isn't it curious, then, that I read all of the books in 
sequence this past month, one after the other, that I moved through the series 
with increasing enjoyment, and that, when I turned the last page of "Butcher's 
Moon," I was pierced with regret that I had come to the end? And that I have 
every expectation of wending my way through them again in a couple of years? 
</P>
<P>
There are several reasons why the books work as well as they do. The writing is 
crisp and clean, flat prose and on-pitch dialogue that carries you along. The 
details -- Parker buying a truck in North Carolina, Parker picking up guns in a 
hobby shop in Syracuse -- are absorbing. The minor characters are wonderfully 
drawn, wholly rendered in a few deft strokes. 
</P>
<P>
But it's Parker himself who makes the books so eternally fascinating. Just as I 
reread Rex Stout for the pleasure of watching Nero Wolfe go about the business 
of being himself, so do I delight in observing Parker as he acts and reacts 
time and time again in utterly Parkeresque fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the books have been filmed, with Parker played at various times by Lee 
Marvin, Robert Duvall, Jim Brown, Peter Coyote and Anna Karina. Commenting on 
the scattershot casting, writer Joe Goldberg told Don, "Well, I guess the 
character lacks definition." 
</P>
<P>
But it would be hard to imagine a character more utterly defined than Parker. 
While he may play a part in the course of a job -- conning his way past a 
guard, posing as a petulant client at a travel agency -- he is incapable of 
dissembling off-stage. He is always true to himself. He is always Parker. 
</P>
<P>
You should know that I am not without a personal bias here. Don Westlake and I 
have been friends for 30 years. Indeed, I first made Parker's acquaintance when 
I read the first chapter of the first book in manuscript in an upstairs flat in 
Canarsie in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
"When a fresh-faced guy in a Chevy offered him a lift, Parker told him to go to 
hell." In the pages that followed, Parker walked across the George Washington 
Bridge into New York, got hold of a checkbook, bought some luggage with bad 
checks, hocked it, repeated the process, then bought some clothes, ate a steak, 
checked into a hotel, and drank a pint of vodka. 
</P>
<P>
"Now what?" I asked the author. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure," he said, "but I'll think of something." 
</P>
<P>
Parker died at the end of the first book; Bucklin Moon, an editor at Pocket 
Books, bought "The Hunter" on the condition that Westlake revive the character 
and write more about him. Future books followed, with the last, "Butcher's 
Moon," published by Random House in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Now here's where it gets a little weird. Ten or 12 books into the series, Don 
wrote a book in which Parker and his gang had to keep stealing the same jewel 
over and over again. This had seemed like a good plot premise, but in the 
writing the book kept turning farcical. It was getting funny, and if there's 
one thing Parker is not, it's funny. 
</P>
<P>
When they hand you a lemon, make lemonade. Westlake changed Parker's name to 
Dortmunder, rewrote the book as comedy, put his own name on it, and published 
it as "The Hot Rock." There have been seven books in all about Dortmunder, and 
they have achieved a widespread popularity which the Parker series never 
attained. In one of them, "Jimmy the Kid," the Dortmunder gang tries to pattern 
a kidnaping on the plot of a Parker novel (not a real Parker novel, a fictional 
Parker novel, its plot hatched specifically for this Dortmunder caper). 
</P>
<P>
More weird things, or at least more things to be confused about: Stephen King 
is a great fan of the Parker books, and his novel "The Dark Half" is about a 
writer who writes nasty noir books under a pen name. The pen name, whom he 
kills off and who responds by coming back to life and going on a rampage, is 
George Stark. 
</P>
<P>
Parker doesn't have a first name. (Actually, I suppose he has one, but nobody 
uses it and we are not told what it is.) Robert B. Parker writes about a Boston 
private detective named Spenser, who doesn't have a first name either. 
(Actually, I suppose he does, but . . .). 
</P>
<P>
Will there be any more books about Parker? Probably not, although one lives in 
hope. "Butcher's Moon," twice the length of its predecessors, was a great tour 
de force, bringing back supporting characters from all the earlier volumes. 
Evidently it has proved an impossible act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
So we have to make do with what we have, 16 books about Parker and four about 
Grofield. Happily, they are as eternally rereadable as any books I know. 
</P>
<P>
Are they authentic? Probably not, but they're close enough to fool experts. A 
fellow I know, who has himself done serious time in federal penitentiaries, was 
impressed to learn that I knew Richard Stark. "You tell your friend," he said, 
"that his books are real popular inside. He's got a whole lot of fans in the 
joint."

UPDATING THE LEGEND OF GUADALCANAL; 
</P>
<P>
GUADALCANAL BY RICHARD B. FRANK (RANDOM HOUSE: $34.95; 828 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Kurzman, Kurzman, a former foreign correspondent for the Washington 
Post, is the author of 11 books, including the current Fatal Voyage: The 
Sinking of the USS Indianapolis (Macmillan). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Guadalcanal is a word that stirs the American soul as few other battle sites 
ever have done. It conjures up visions of supreme courage, bulldog tenacity and 
impassioned patriotism. It is a symbol of all that is most admirable in the 
American character. For in some of the bloodiest fighting of World War II, more 
than 7,000 U.S. Marines, soldiers, sailors and airmen perished in the fetid 
forests of this remote South Pacific island and in the turbulent waters and 
transparent skies enclosing it, while killing two-thirds of a fanatical 
20,000-man Japanese army. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is the legend of Guadalcanal simply symbolic. The ferocious struggles there 
thrust the United States onto the offensive at a time when the Japanese, even 
though defeated at Midway, were seriously threatening the American campaign in 
the Pacific and still dreaming of a negotiated peace that would let them keep 
the spoils of conquest. Both sides knew that the decisive battle of the war in 
the Pacific would be fought here. Indeed, victory at Guadalcanal opened the way 
to America's ultimate victory in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The legend of Guadalcanal has been told many times by able historians and 
journalists -- among them Samuel Elliot Morrison and Richard Tregaskis -- but 
Richard B. Frank, a former captain in the 101st Airborne Division who served in 
Vietnam, has written what must be the definitive book on the subject. His 
"Guadalcanal" is an enormous work based on the most meticulous research. 
Especially intriguing is the new material gleaned from official Japanese battle 
reports that reveal the frustrations, fears and fantasies of an enemy portrayed 
in most World War II books as soulless robots. One starving Japanese officer 
poignantly scribbled in his diary: "Rice. I really want to give my men as much 
rice as they want. That is the only wish I have." 
</P>
<P>
In this brilliant academic history, almost every unit in every battle is 
identified; almost every action by every platoon is described; almost every 
weapon is taken apart, examined, appraised. Individual characters are 
mentioned, but they play only cameo roles in Frank's epochal production. In one 
shattering account, the author quotes a sailor who survived the sinking of the 
destroyer Juneau and witnessed a shark gouging out a shipmate's shoulder: 
</P>
<P>
"He looked at his shipmates there and realized that he was making them 
nauseated, that he was driving them crazy by just being there . . . he pushed 
himself off the life nets and swam out about five or six feet and let the 
sharks have him rather than lay there and die like a coward and jeopardize the 
live(s) of his shipmates." 
</P>
<P>
Such drama often is obscured by the manual-like detailing of battle, but it is 
this detail that makes the book unique. Here is everything you might want to 
know -- or not want to know -- about Guadalcanal. And all the facts are 
presented in an orderly manner and in studied perspective. Frank limberly jumps 
from jungle conflict to naval encounter to aerial clash, dealing with each side 
in turn, showing how each perceived the thinking of the other, weaving the 
clutter of episodes into the whole. 
</P>
<P>
Frank's objectivity is reflected in his comparative appraisal of the character 
of the antagonists. While heroism abounds on the American side, the Japanese 
emerge as opponents more than worthy of his admiration. He quotes one U.S. 
officer as saying: 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us who have fought in the Pacific are ready to admit here and now, 
away from all the convincing firsthand evidence we have seen -- mass 
starvation, untold suffering, shell shock, cannibalism, mass suicide -- that 
for sheer, bloody, hardened steel guts, the stocky and hard-muscled little Jap 
doughboy has it all over any of us." 
</P>
<P>
As Frank points out, the brave fighters on both sides, ironically, often were 
undercut by the misjudgments and faulty leadership of their commanders. Thus, 
Japanese leaders were convinced that only 2,000 Marines had landed in 
Guadalcanal and that their morale was low; in fact, more than 20,000 had waded 
ashore and were ready for battle, even though, as the author states, they 
"lacked the moral reserve that a long string of successes or a large 
preponderance of power gives any unit." 
</P>
<P>
And American leaders were just as convinced that when Japanese ships sought to 
reach Guadalcanal, they were trying to land reinforcements, though their 
mission was, on the contrary, to evacuate troops already on the island. At one 
point, some U.S. officials, unaware that the Japanese were barely hanging on, 
harbored doubts that the Americans could hang on, especially after they 
suffered several naval defeats. When a reporter asked Secretary of the Navy 
Frank Knox if they could, he dourly replied: 
</P>
<P>
"I will not make any predictions. . . . What I am trying to say is that there 
is a good stiff fight going on. Everybody hopes we can hold on." 
</P>
<P>
Such doubts generated battle plans that resulted in the needless killing of 
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men. 
</P>
<P>
If flawed intelligence and poor judgment were common to both sides, so was the 
tendency to cover up bad news. The American brass, it seems, feared public 
reaction back home almost as much as their Japanese counterparts did. After a 
sea battle in which the U.S. Navy lost a number of ships, naval officials 
confirmed the sinking of only one unidentified vessel and concealed the other 
losses from the public for two months -- until they could be announced in 
conjunction with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
This was not a unique naval tactic in World War II. When the cruiser USS 
Indianapolis, which had carried the major components of the Hiroshima atomic 
bomb to the island of Tinian, was sunk shortly after delivering them -- losing 
880 men, most while drifting in the shark-infested water for five days -- naval 
officials revealed the disaster one hour after President Truman announced the 
end of World War II. The story, as the Navy apparently calculated, was buried 
in history. 
</P>
<P>
In this book, Frank, without tarnishing the legend of Guadalcanal, bares many 
aspects of the battle that, until now, have been buried in history.U.S. troops 
on Guadalcanal, February, 1943.

WHAT'S GOOD TASTE? WHAT IS ART? WHAT'S REAL? WHO OWNS AMERICA?

What is art? 
</P>
<P>
Art is the most skilled and most developed way of doing even the most ordinary 
things; that is to say that we all use our voices, but that when someone is 
singing, the art of singing is the most skillful use of the voice. 
</P>
<P>
When it comes to obscenity . . .in our country we are in a debate about ethics 
and morality, asking which emotions become appropriate in response to a work of 
art. If a work of art moves into the realm of sensuality, does it then move 
into the realm of obscenity? This can become quite subjective. 
</P>
<P>
Who decides? 
</P>
<P>
In the interest of preserving democracy, these must always be questions that 
don't have easy answers. I don't think that art is decided by institutions, 
necessarily -- anyone can name great artists who have been rejected by great 
institutions. Nor should it be decided by the artists themselves; that would 
allow me to arrange the chairs in my room and call it a work of art. But I 
don't believe that we want restrictive judgments unless we want to devalue 
democracy, and devalue free expression and thought in this country. 
</P>
<P>
I do believe that public funds should be used to support art, and obviously I 
believe in the mission and purpose and value of an organization like the 
National Endowment for the Arts. Public television is a medium that provides 
information and education, and attempts to do so in the most entertaining and 
engaging format possible. We aspire toward art.

</P>
<P>
Good taste is pretending to be interested when you're bored and acting more 
reserved than you feel in order to impress people you don't like. 
</P>
<P>
Who decides? 
</P>
<P>
Good taste is always decided by the richest person in the room. In cases of 
equal wealth, good taste is decided by the person whose normal facial 
expression most resembles that of someone getting a lingering whiff of a very 
disagreeable odor.

Who owns America? 
</P>
<P>
I don't see what the problem is. I don't see where we have something to be 
afraid of or that foreign purchases have adversely affected anything in this 
country. The competition with Japan has only done us good. Until the 
competition started, the American car was the worst-made in the world. They 
(the companies) were forced to make improvements. We did not make progress in 
this country in the last 20 years. America was getting sluggish.

<P>
Our ratings have nothing to do with taste. They have to do with parental

tastes enter into the ratings decisions, we would not be doing our job.

</P>
<P>
What is art and who decides? 
</P>
<P>
While damn near everybody in the art world thinks that the decision of what is 
art is up for grabs, in fact, only the artist has that power. The rest is 
seasonal gossip. 
</P>
<P>
Who pays? 
</P>
<P>
The outcome of the National Endowment for the Arts controversy this year has 
left us with a gravely damaged institution. NEA grants can no longer be taken 
seriously. They have lost their professional prestige now that the chair of the 
Endowment will decide who is to receive grants. Peer panels of professionals 
will no longer make the decisions and therefore there is a justifiable 
suspicion that either a grantee has the right political connections or else is 
so bland as to be thought of as safe from attack by Helmsian zealots. Thus, an 
artist who receives a grant will have to suffer a certain onus that will come 
along with the money. 
</P>
<P>
When the endowments were founded, the wording of the legislation sheilded them 
from political manipulation. That shield has been pierced so now the endowments 
are ripe for pork-barreling, and there is little reason to believe that the 
current chairman is not susceptible to those temptations. 
</P>
<P>
The arts communities were amazed and then stunned by the zeal with which (NEA 
Chairman) Mr. (John) Frohnmayer rushed to enforce the language favored by Mr. 
Helms. Mr. Frohnmayer's unncecessary implementation of those oaths showed that 
he had little understanding of the arts and even less awareness of how to use 
the great support he actually enjoyed in the battle just ended. 
</P>
<P>
Inasmuch as he is not a trained arts executive, there is little reason to be 
optimistic that his having the power to decide who is to receive grants is 
justified. We would not put him at the head of the Department of Health and 
Human Services, for which he is equally unqualified. We (in the arts) should be 
able to propose qualified people, and we should be able to prepare an advisory 
of at least the abstract qualifications for that position.

<P>
'THE GODFATHER PART III' DOESN'T ACHIEVE ITS TOWERING GOALS, BUT THE CAPSTONE 
TO THE CORLEONE SAGA IS STILL ONE OF THE YEAR'S BEST FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL WILMINGTON, Michael Wilmington writes about film for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"It's not personal, Sonny. It's strictly business." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Corleone in 
</P>
<P>
"The Godfather" (1972) 
</P>
<P>
After 16 years, it was an offer Francis Ford Coppola couldn't refuse. In "The 
Godfather Part III" (opening Tuesday citywide), he and Mario Puzo return to 
their franchise: the Corleone Family Saga. Once again, they take up the 
violent, virtuosic, densely detailed epic of gangsters and American society -- 
of omerta and famiglia, bullets and cannoli, blood ties and blood-stained 
vendettas -- that they spun with such staggering aplomb and world-wide impact 
in "The Godfather" (1972) and "The Godfather Part II" (1974). 
</P>
<P>
This new sequel, in which Don Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) tries to go straight 
and crash the Vatican itself, is another rich, broadly scaled work, shot 
through with brutality and brio. It has arias and grand moments to match either 
of its predecessors: the coldly festive opening at a celebration of a Mafia 
don's charities; a nervous, panoramic Little Italy assassination; a jolting 
comic-violent scene in which Andy Garcia, playing the newest Corleone, faces 
down two would-be assassins who interrupt him in the middle of an assignation. 
</P>
<P>
The movie carries the trilogy's recurring major figure -- Pacino's Michael 
Corleone -- from 1979 to his death, knitting together dozens of old plot 
strands, themes and symbolic motifs. It brings back the original 
cinematographer, Gordon Willis, that virtuoso of deep shadows, metallic 
sunlight and deceptively flat perspectives. It reintroduces a gallery of 
familiar faces -- including sister Connie (Talia Shire), divorced wife Kay 
(Diane Keaton), and ultra-disturbing background figure torpedo Al Neri (Richard 
Bright) -- and drives them toward an operatic climax, where, to the strains of 
Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," Michael meets a family destiny right out of 
Verdi, Shakespeare or James M. Cain. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, though "Godfather III" is definitely one of the best American movies of 
the year -- a work of high ensemble talent and intelligence, gorgeously mounted 
and crafted, artistically audacious in ways that most American movies don't 
even attempt -- it's still a disappointment. It fails on the highest level. 
It's not the capstone we might have wanted Coppola to make, not quite a fitting 
climax to a series that ranks among the American cinema's most remarkable 
sustained achievements. 
</P>
<P>
It's a matter, perhaps, of both script and tone. The first two "Godfathers," 
dominated by Pacino's menacingly passive Michael and by the magisterially 
gravelly croak of Marlon Brando or Robert De Niro as the old and young Don Vito 
Corleone, were violent tales done with incongruous subtlety and discretion. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, in his early 30s, Coppola's narrative style was marvelously 
circumspect. He bathed those earlier films in a tender melancholy, a sense of 
reverie that stood in eerie counterpoint to the lurid events and horrific 
gangland killings. Part I is more boisterous and bloody, Part II more complex, 
poetic and charged with grief. But neither ever seemed to raise a voice 
unnecessarily, or strain for an effect. 
</P>
<P>
Part III, by contrast, has scenes or plot twists -- a flabbergasting helicopter 
attack on a Cosa Nostra commission meeting; the incongruously rapid rise of 
Sonny Corleone's illegitimate son, Vincent Mancini (Garcia); a Byzantine hive 
of intrigue revealed at the Vatican -- where the tone seems forced, under-felt, 
almost strident. Is that copter rub-out an allusion to the "Ride of the 
Valkyries" in "Apocalypse Now"? What prompts the operatic vocation of Michael's 
son Anthony (Franc D'Ambrosio), beyond Coppola's own musical family? Why are 
dialogues between the partially reconciled Michael and Kay so bland and 
perfunctory? And how can Michael muster the muscle to stave off attacks from 
other Mafiosi after going completely "legitimate"? 
</P>
<P>
Since "Apocalypse Now," Coppola has changed into a very different filmmaker 
than he was in 1974. Now, he regularly goes for visual opulence, extravagant 
effect; his masterpiece of the '80s was the film noir, German Expressionist, 
neo-realist teen melodrama "Rumble Fish." But "Godfather III," for all its 
obvious quality and visual bravura, lacks the fullness or inevitability of the 
first two films: the ways Coppola and Puzo seemed to skim easily over the 
social and criminal terrain of the first half of the 20th Century. In a way, 
this movie seems to come from a whole different world -- and not simply because 
it's set in 1979, five years after the release of "Godfather II," and 20 years 
after the conclusion of the events it portrays. 
</P>
<P>
In "Godfather III," there's something sad, slightly vacant and dourly dreamy in 
Pacino's eyes as the 59-year-old Michael. Set deep in a bulldog mug, with a 
crew-cut receding back, they're the eyes of a man who'd rather be almost 
anywhere but in his immediate surroundings, a man who -- like the Misfit in 
Flannery O'Connor's "A Good Man Is Hard to Find" -- believes "There ain't no 
real pleasure in life." 
</P>
<P>
It's Pacino's face -- its wasted, bitter, ravaged resignation -- that many 
people will recall longest from "Godfather III." And they'll also remember the 
leaner, slicker, more wolfish features of Andy Garcia as the up-and-coming 
new-style don. Garcia seizes the screen here, and gives an explosive, 
tigerishly self-confident performance. Playing Sonny Corleone's short-fused, 
illegitimate son -- who was being conceived in the wedding scene of the first 
"Godfather" -- Garcia creates a tense, narcissistic killer. Unlike Michael, 
he's supremely equipped by instinct to be a gangster: a man of fast reflexes, 
intense ambition and no moral qualms. In his first confrontation with Joey Zaza 
(Joe Mantegna), Michael's successor and rival, Vincent nearly bites off his 
ear. 
</P>
<P>
Pacino, on the other hand, plays Michael as a tough, self-contained pro, 
trapped in gloomy self-examination after a life of brutal, near-reflexive 
decisions and actions. He's rotting inside. His disease -- diabetes -- suggests 
here spiritual as well as physical decay. And, after rising to the top, he's 
now trying to go beyond, to move hundreds of millions of dollars, buy God's 
emissaries and enter Heaven through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
"Michael Corleone, do you renounce Satan?" a priest asked Michael during the 
baptism of his godson in the first "Godfather," a scene that was shockingly 
intercut with the systematic execution of his enemies. The irony of that 
legendary climax lay in the juxtaposition of outward piety or conformity with 
covert slaughter; an irony carried on even more heavily here, with one church 
scene after another, and Michael actually confessing three decades of crimes to 
the future Pope John Paul I (Raf Vallone). Michael, an outsider in a family of 
gangsters, had become the most dangerous criminal of all: the soured idealist, 
the man who knows and hates evil, but does it anyway. He was the murderer who 
fully accepted Montaigne's maxim, "Hypocrisy is the debt vice pays to virtue.". 
</P>
<P>
There's always been an obvious connection between Coppola and Michael; Coppola 
deliberately played it up in "The Godfather," giving Michael the middle name 
Francis. In "Godfather III," the identification becomes almost eerie. Michael 
is a man from a tight-knit family, risen to the top, living a life of tension 
and near financial ruin, desperately trying to pull away from a business that 
won't let him go. 
</P>
<P>
When Coppola decides to end the film with the possible sacrifice of a child, it 
obviously has personal reverberations. So do Michael's financial takeovers. And 
so does his tight-knit family: Talia Shire's newly icy, resolute fury; the 
artistic aspirations of Anthony; Kay's moral superiority. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola and Puzo notably ignore politics this time around, but as they focus on 
the last ravages of the Corleone family, driven to their dissolution, they also 
create a vast incestuous tangle among the worlds of crime, business, religion 
and art. In this corrupt alliance, only the world of art is presented as 
uncompromised and pure. It's the world that the idealists like Anthony try to 
escape into; it's also a world that, as in the performance of "Cavalleria 
Rusticana," bizarrely mirrors everything that happens outside it. 
</P>
<P>
But religion is just as tainted as the others, polluted by its vast acquisition 
of wealth and power. Coppola and Puzo deliberately play here with references to 
the Vatican Bank scandal, as well as rumors about the possible murder of the 
Pope. "All my life I kept trying to go up in society," Michael remarks to 
Vincent. "Where everything higher up was legal. But the higher I go, the 
crookeder it gets. Where the hell does it end?" 
</P>
<P>
In hell, obviously, which is exactly where "Godfather III" leaves Michael: the 
emotional Hades of a man who has sacrificed the only thing that gave all his 
crimes meaning -- famiglia. In the last shot of the movie, an orange -- a fruit 
that has had numerous sinister connotations through all the episodes of the 
saga -- slips from his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
In 1972, when he made the first of the "Godfather" movies, Coppola scored an 
unprecedented coup. He seemed to have made a movie that was "Citizen Kane" and 
"Gone With the Wind" simultaneously: a huge blockbuster, biggest of its time, 
that also had depth, social vision and multiple layers of meaning, a film that 
satisfied both the vast pop culture audience and the intelligentsia. For this, 
he became a hero to many film critics, some of whom were all too eager to cast 
him as villain or betrayer -- or fool -- later on. 
</P>
<P>
The Corleone saga was something unusual in gangster movies: a crime epic that 
presented the Mafia family and, especially, their leonine, mumbling patriarch 
Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) in the kind of sweepingly romantic terms that 
characterized more conventional, affirmative family epics. And part of its vast 
audience obviously ignored Coppola's dark subversion of their image; they found 
the Corleones endearing, Michael almost heroic. Coppola brilliantly used actors 
-- Brando, Pacino, Keaton, Shire, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale and 
the others -- whose sensibility opened up their parts in unique ways. They 
seemed -- still seem -- more like a family of artists than a family of 
criminals. As a group, they had incongruous sensitivity, delicacy and grace -- 
and vulnerability as well. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola didn't cast gangster "types" except in the non-Corleone roles and 
that's what gives the movie its tense undercurrents. The most moving moment in 
all three movies came from the late John Cazale as Fredo in "Godfather II": 
delicate, enervated, reclining painfully beside Michael, who will soon kill 
him, crying out his rage and pain at being passed over. Sweet, ineffectual, 
doomed Fredo didn't belong in the average gangster movie. But then, none of 
them did: not even Caan's Sonny, the hot-headed ladies' man. 
</P>
<P>
But time's passage has destroyed or altered the context in which those first 
two "Godfather" movies were produced -- a momentarily fertile climate for 
offbeat movies in the early '70s -- and replaced it with another, shallower era 
where financial stakes are huge and artistic gambles minimal. The daringly 
structured "Godfather II" probably couldn't be made today, and 16 horrifically 
intense and sometimes brutal years have intervened for Coppola: years filled 
with sudden success, financial catastrophes, spectacular public and artistic 
reversals and family tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
In a way, we can sense all of this in the new film. Perhaps because the first 
script was written too hastily, in six weeks instead of the six months Coppola 
requested, the writing is both overly formulaic and strangely unguarded and 
open. Despite frequent rewriting afterward, Coppola hasn't let his attitudes 
and feelings get swallowed up in the material. They keep jutting out: most 
obviously in the way he uses his lightly experienced and miscast daughter Sofia 
(a last-minute replacement for Winona Ryder) as Michael's daughter Mary, 
lavishing an almost defiant paternal affection on every shot. Oddly enough, 
"Godfather III" is in some ways a typical, perhaps too typical, movie sequel 
and, in others, a startlingly confessional film. Real anguish and pain keep 
seeping up through the predictable kinks of the story. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most attractive things about Coppola is the very intensity and range 
of his ambition, the way he wants to be a super-filmmaker, master of 
everything: a fine writer, a visual virtuoso, a technical whiz-bang, a master 
of complex effects and camera movements and an actor's director generating the 
raw, improvisatory magic of a Cassavetes or Scorsese. But sometimes you can't 
be everything, and this movie's major weakness lies in the area that's always 
been one of Coppola's prime assets: his screenwriting. The frequent rewriting 
after the original six-week wonder can't overcome flimsiness or broadness in 
the framework. In the end, "Godfather III" is more conventional than its 
antecedents. 
</P>
<P>
It's inevitable. On short notice, Coppola and Puzo get what you would expect: 
the broad symbolic outlines and motifs and the big "aria" scenes. But they 
haven't been able to tie everything together, fill in all the connections, 
remove scenes that obviously don't work, re-create the seamless embellishment 
and profusion of the earlier films. Six weeks was an offer they should have 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
Almost equally damaging: the defection of Robert Duvall, due to a salary 
dispute. In 1974, "Godfather II" also lost Richard Castellano's Clemenza to 
salary demands; Coppola had to kill off the character and give his lines to 
Michael Gazzo's Frankie Pentangeli. But Duvall's Tom Hagen is more crucial than 
Clemenza. As the Corleones' adopted son and consigliere, he's so inextricably 
tied into the whole texture and emotional weave of the story that he's always 
seemed indispensable, perhaps even part of some inevitable, slowly ripening 
climax, a last bloody act where Hagen would play combatant in a final betrayal 
and clash with Michael. Writing Duvall out of the movie seems painfully 
unnecessary. Leaving a priestly son (John Savage's Andrew Hagen) in his place, 
while handing over some of his lines to George Hamilton, as a silken new 
consigliere, is a poor substitute. 
</P>
<P>
In light of all this, it may seem perverse to call "Godfather III" one of the 
year's best American movies. But it is. The brilliance and fertility of 
Coppola's talents and the excellence of his cast and crew pulls him through 
once again. 
</P>
<P>
He's always been a great assembler of talent; if he's a dream-castle builder, 
he's a supremely generous one. Visually, this is the most gorgeous of the three 
"Godfathers"; Willis and production designer Dean Tavoularis have outdone 
themselves. And it's loaded with fascinating moments: Garcia's magnetic 
psychopathology, Pacino's weary pursuit of grace, Eli Wallach's angelic 
duplicities as Don Altobello and, especially, that climactic opera house 
set-piece, with its bravura echoes of "Senso" and Hitchcock's second "The Man 
Who Knew Too Much." And if the movie loses some -- maybe even most -- of the 
battles you wish it had won, it still scores a magnificent final victory by 
rounding out a series that ranks with the most ambitious and extraordinary 
creations in American movies. 
</P>
<P>
When you try so hard for beauty, complexity and richness, you can leave the 
audience with a banquet even when you fail. That's what Coppola does here. The 
problems that afflict him in this compromised "Godfather III" (rated R, for 
sex, violence and language) are ones perhaps endemic to today's big-budget 
moviemaking. Its triumphs are the victories -- perhaps partial but certainly 
precious -- of moviemakers working together, of artistic devotion and ambition, 
of the ensemble, the famiglia. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Godfather" series -- like "Citizen Kane" for Orson Welles -- has perhaps 
been Coppola's crown jewel and also his curse. But, if he hasn't completed it 
perfectly, at least he's completed it with passion. And passion is something 
that should never have a price.

<P>
'GOODFELLAS' MAY BE CLEANING UP IN THE CRITICS' AWARDS, BUT KEVIN COSTNER'S 
WESTERN EPIC HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS OSCAR LIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Jack Mathews is The Times' film editor. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greek director Theo Angelopoulos' "Landscape in the Mist" was the best picture 
of 1990, according to two of The Times' regular film critics, but don't mark 
your Oscar ballots yet. You're hearing it here first: "Landscape in the Mist" 
will not win the Academy Award for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
That doesn't mean it isn't the best. It's just . . . foreign, and in the 
current mood in Hollywood, foreign is only good if you own shares in a studio. 
</P>
<P>
The best picture of the year will not be Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas" either, 
even though that was the best-reviewed film of the year, and the recent winner 
of both the Los Angeles and New York film critics' awards. "GoodFellas" is a 
New York film about a bunch of gangsters, and the predominantly L.A.-based 
academy members do not cotton to rude New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
It won't be Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather Part III" either, even though 
a third Oscar would be a fitting, if overly generous, capper to that series. 
Coppola has lost a step or two since his Wunderkind days, and giving the second 
sequel its top prize would be a virtual confession by the academy that its 
standards have come down since "Godfather II" in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
And it won't be "The Sheltering Sky," "Havana" or "Avalon," even though the 
directors of those movies -- Bernardo Bertolucci, Sydney Pollack and Barry 
Levinson -- swept the Oscar table with their last films. Bertolucci's "The Last 
Emperor" won nine Academy Awards in 1987, Pollack's "Out of Africa" won six in 
1985 and Levinson's "Rain Man" took home four in 1988. When you make movies as 
successful as those, your next one is guaranteed to be a disappointment, and 
for that you must be punished. 
</P>
<P>
So, if none of those, what? 
</P>
<P>
 Sungmanitutonka Ob Waci. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Lakota Sioux for "Dances With Wolves" -- and you can bank on it. Kevin 
Costner's airy Western, about a Civil War fighting man who wins a frontier 
outpost and is assimilated by the Sioux he meets there, has Oscar written all 
over it, in large-print English. It is an ambitious film with liberal 
humanistic elements that overcame faulty early word-of-mouth, a three-hour 
running time and a tome of subtitles to become both a critical and a commercial 
success. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves" is making Costner a hero in a lot of voters' eyes: The 
film has evoked such fond memories of the Western that it could revive the 
genre and, once again, a leading man has, in his first attempt at directing, 
shown that actors do know a little something about storytelling (Robert 
Redford, Paul Newman and Jack Lemmon all danced with the wolves before him). 
</P>
<P>
"Dances" has the Oscar guilt vote in its pocket. It has a strong humanistic 
point-of-view and seems to right some of the wrongs done in all those cowboy 'n 
Injun movies of the past, not least by casting Native Americans in Native 
American roles. If John Ford were around to direct this film, we might have 
seen Timothy Hutton playing Kicking Bird. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Costner will win is another question. There was a split last year when 
"Driving Miss Daisy" was named best picture while the directing award went to 
"Born on the Fourth of July's" Oliver Stone. If that occurs again, Scorsese -- 
the most consistent American filmmaker since the fall of Coppola -- is the 
likeliest winner. 
</P>
<P>
There's one other reasonable scenario: a sweep for Penny Marshall's 
"Awakenings," which opened Friday. The super-sentimental drama about a New York 
doctor who awakens a ward of comatose patients with experimental drug therapy 
may win the "Rain Man" vote. It makes people weep and when academy members 
weep, their votes are often carried along in the torrent. 
</P>
<P>
If Penny Marshall gets a best-director nomination, it will be the first one for 
an American woman, and though it's unlikely enough of the Old Boys of the 
academy would vote for her on the final ballot, the more progressive-minded 
directors' branch might put her on it. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, "Dances With Wolves" and "Awakenings" are the only films that 
meet one of the two minimum Oscar standards (a liberal point of view about a 
significant social issue, or it makes you cry), and with "The Sheltering Sky" 
having turned into two hours of bad desert road, there are no other serious 
contenders for the Grand Prize. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves," "Awakenings," and "GoodFellas" all figure to be nominated 
for best picture. The other two spots will probably come from a group that 
includes Barbet Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune," "The Godfather Part III" and 
"Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
On the long-shot list are: Stephen Frears' "The Grifters," the best-yet Jim 
Thompson adaptation but one that may be too dark for the Academy; Warren 
Beatty's "Dick Tracy," probably done in by Disney's and Beatty's 
super-saturation promotional campaign, and -- dare we mention a movie that's 
taken in more than $200 million? -- Jerry Zucker's "Ghost." (Remember: These 
are impulse choices. Nobody really votes for the best movie.) 
</P>
<P>
In sizing up the fields for the various categories, keep in mind that only in 
the best-picture category do all 5,000 members of the academy vote; in all 
other categories, the nominations are made by members of the individual 
branches. That's how a "Ghost," for instance, could slip into the final five 
for best picture without getting a single other nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Among the directors, Costner is a sure nominee, as is Scorsese, and with the 
reverence for the whole Corleone saga, Coppola seems a safe bet. Marshall 
should make it, too, leaving the final spot to be filled from a group that 
includes Levinson, Bertolucci and Frears. 
</P>
<P>
For a worthy longshot in your office pool, try Jean-Paul Rappeneau, for "Cyrano 
de Bergerac." 
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Irons dazzled the critics with his scary-weird Boris Karloff take on 
Claus von Bulow in Barbet Schroeder's "Reversal of Fortune," and he's a clear 
favorite in the best actor category of the Oscars as well. There, he will be 
joined by Robert De Niro, the guinea-pig comatose patient in "Awakenings." 
Robin Williams, the doctor in "Awakenings," may also get a nomination, if 
enough people cry their brains out. 
</P>
<P>
Gerard Depardieu, whose performance in the title role of "Cyrano de Bergerac" 
earned him the best actor award at Cannes, rates a better than even chance of 
an Oscar nomination. The actors branch has often voted in actors from 
foreign-language films; they did it just last year, giving Isabelle Adjani a 
best-actress nomination for "Camille Claudel," in which, coincidentally, she 
co-starred with Depardieu. 
</P>
<P>
Whether Al Pacino makes it or not depends on how the academy at large responds 
to "Godfather III." Opinions of audiences at early screenings have split 
widely, and Pacino and the film were shut out in the Los Angeles and New York 
film critics' voting. Given the relatively short list of serious contenders, 
the betting here is that Pacino will make it. 
</P>
<P>
Other actors getting some early support in the Oscar huddles that inevitably 
form at industry get-togethers this time of year are: Costner, who is more 
highly regarded for his direction of "Dances With Wolves" than his performance 
in it; Richard Harris, as the gusty Irish cattle rancher in Jim Sheridan's "The 
Field"; and Tim Roth, the passionate and growingly mad Vincent van Gogh in 
Robert Altman's "Vincent &amp; Theo." 
</P>
<P>
The best-actress category, as usual and predictably in patriarchal Hollywood, 
is the weakest of them all. Just think of any woman's performance that stands 
out and write her name on your ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Woodward, one of the film business's most popular actresses, slipped 
neatly into the skin of Mrs. Bridge, opposite real-life husband Newman, and has 
already been named best actress by the New York critics. The L.A. critics 
tabbed Anjelica Huston, but couldn't make up their minds which of her 
performances they liked most -- as the head of a child-hating coven in "The 
Witches," or the lethal con artist in "The Grifters" -- so they will put both 
titles on her plaque. The academy voters won't have that trouble; she'll be 
nominated for "The Grifters." 
</P>
<P>
Almost certain to join them on the ballot is Kathy Bates, the fine stage 
actress who turned in a brilliantly scary performance as a romance novelist's 
crazed fan in Rob Reiner's "Misery." 
</P>
<P>
Debra Winger's performance in "The Sheltering Sky" was -- besides Vittorio 
Storaro's sensational photography -- the only interesting diversion in that 
seat-squirmer, and she should get a nomination on appreciation alone. The same 
may be said of Mia Farrow's work in Woody Allen's wafer-thin "Alice." 
</P>
<P>
Other actresses in showy roles include Lena Olin in "Havana," Cher in 
"Mermaids" and -- way back in February -- Jessica Lange in "Men Don't Leave." 
But those movies were met with the cool breezes of disinterest and aren't 
likely to play any role in the coming Oscar race. 
</P>
<P>
More likely contenders are Shirley MacLaine and Meryl Streep from Mike Nichols' 
likeably lightweight "Postcards From the Edge." 
</P>
<P>
Among supporting-actress candidates, Lorraine Bracco stood out in a movie that 
was mostly about, starring and appreciated by men -- "GoodFellas." Bracco, who 
played Mafia bad guy Ray Liotta's spunky wife, won the L.A. critics' award and 
was the runner-up in New York. She's in. 
</P>
<P>
Whoopi Goldberg, for once, was perfectly cast -- as a bogus medium who 
discovers powers she doesn't want -- in "Ghost," and gave a performance too 
enjoyable to be overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
British stage actress Joan Plowright was the New York critics' choice for best 
supporting actress for her performance as the matriarch of the Krichinsky 
family in "Avalon" and is probably the early favorite for an Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
Others in contention: Glenn Close, who spent as much time narrating from a coma 
as performing as Sunny von Bulow in "Reversal of Fortune"; Bonnie Bedelia, who 
actually expanded the role of the accused man's wife in the film version of 
"Presumed Innocent"; Dianne Wiest, always popular with both critics and academy 
members, for "Edward Scissorhands"; and -- if "Dances With Wolves" produces a 
sweep -- Mary McDonnell, the adopted Sioux they called Stands With Fist. 
</P>
<P>
The supporting-actor category figures to be loaded with some low-down 
characters. The year was like that. Among the actors playing gangsters really 
well: 
</P>
<P>
Joe Pesci was the linchpin of "GoodFellas," a thug whose gruff humor made us 
laugh through the first half of the film, and whose cold-bloodedness made us 
face who we were with in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Garcia stood out in a star-making performance as Michael Corleone's 
illegitimate nephew in "Godfather III." 
</P>
<P>
It will be hard to ignore Al Pacino's performance in "Dick Tracy"; Little Al 
was like a wild cockroach as Big Boy Caprice, the blubbering humpbacked mob 
leader. He was better as Caprice than as Corleone. Dustin Hoffman deserves a 
super cameo citation or something for his bit in the same film, as the nervous 
snitch Mumbles. 
</P>
<P>
If Marlon Brando's whisper of a performance in "A Dry White Season" was worth a 
nomination last year, he ought to win it all for his full-bodied parody of his 
own Don Vito Corleone in "The Freshman." 
</P>
<P>
John Turturro, a rising character actor, was superb as the lead Mafia weasel in 
the Coen Brothers' "Miller's Crossing." 
</P>
<P>
If the gang players don't dominate the category, other contenders include: 
Graham Green, the marvelous face of Kicking Bird in "Dances With Wolves"; Bruce 
Davison, the agonized lover of a dying AIDS victim in "Longtime Companion"; and 
Armin Mueller-Stahl, patriarch of the Krichinskys in "Avalon."

THE BEST FILMS OF 1990 -- FOUR VIEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are the Top 10 films of 1990 as selected by Sheila Benson, Peter Rainer, 
Kevin Thomas and Michael Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
1 -- "GoodFellas." In Martin Scorsese's portrait of mid-level Mafia life, 
grisly events are often as not set off by a darkly hilarious humor, while the 
screenplay gives these wiseguys' street talk a cheerfully obscene poetry. 
Played with terrifying authority, it is a savvy backstage tour of a particular 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
2 -- "Dances With Wolves." First-time director Kevin Costner has shaped a 
passionate, clear-eyed vision of life in the late 1860s at the edge of the 
Northwestern frontier. Costner has an infectious empathy for this rolling, 
treeless land and for the Sioux. 
</P>
<P>
3 -- "The Godfather Part III." This last chapter of Francis Coppola's 
monumental gangster trilogy is uneven in ways its predecessors never were, but 
the flaws are not mortal. Flamboyantly operatic, utterly engrossing, the film 
touches every important theme of the first two and strikes its deepest note 
with Al Pacino's performance as the tormented Michael Corleone. 
</P>
<P>
4 -- "Sweetie." This portrait of a tightly knit Australian family marks the 
debut of the assured writer-director Jane Campion; Campion has an original 
visual style, her work with actors is extraordinary, and she has a streak of 
pure romanticism that keeps the film's Grand Guignol undertones in balance. 
</P>
<P>
5 -- "Life and Nothing But." Bertrand Tavernier and his great, worldly 
alter-ego Philippe Noiret bring off an almost impossible combination: a 
full-bodied affirmation of life and passion amid reminders of death and 
sacrifice in post-World War I France. 
</P>
<P>
6 -- "To Sleep With Anger." Charles Burnett fills his 
slice-of-middle-class-life with mystery and a sense of malevolence as the visit 
of a sweet-talking friend from the old South frays the fabric of a warm, close 
family. The film proves William Faulkner's thesis that a writer who works from 
his own home ground finds sustenance enough to last a lifetime. 7 -- "Reversal 
of Fortune." Director Barbet Schroeder's choice to stage the story of the Von 
Bulows as a tragicomedy of manners made it just that. Jeremy Irons' bitingly 
witty performance as Von Bulow is rich, paradoxical and leaves behind doubts -- 
part of the film's deliberate mischief. 
</P>
<P>
8 -- "Vincent &amp; Theo." Robert Altman's approach to the Great Biographical 
Film is astringent and realistic; the last years of the brothers Van Gogh 
mirror the tenacity it takes to follow an artist's path -- something with which 
Altman himself is not unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
9 -- "Men Don't Leave." Paul Brickman's film about a family adjusting to the 
shocking death of their husband/father has a captivating unpredictability and 
the highest concentration of offbeat characters since "The Accidental Tourist." 
</P>
<P>
10 -- "The Natural History of Parking Lots." Everett Lewis' arresting debut 
film concerns two poignant kids of privilege, Hancock Park throw-aways 
considered even more disposable than their parents' marriages. Touchingly 
performed, beautifully shot, this modest feature is the announcement of a 
singular new voice among American independents.

AWARDING THE 26TH ANNUAL GOLDEN FEATHER AWARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER, Leonard Feather is The Times' jazz critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the 26th annum, the time has arrived to consider the hits and misses, the 
triumphs and trials of what well may have been the most active year in jazz 
history. 
</P>
<P>
The activity may not have been at a new peak qualitatively, but in terms of the 
number of people involved at every level -- as professionals or students, 
musicians or critics -- the year was surely without precedent. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the precedents were set in that prime focal point of jazz activity: 
Japan. For a recent appearance by Miles Davis at Blues Alley in Tokyo, the club 
slapped on a door charge of 40,000 yen -- about $292. Some of that profit 
presumably must trickle down to the leader and even to his sidemen. 
</P>
<P>
Other people and places offered evidence of the continuing innovative urge. The 
following winners of this year's Golden Feathers come readily to mind: 
</P>
<P>
MAN OF THE YEAR: Dizzy Gillespie. At 73, the composer-trumpeter-traveler can 
probably count more airports on this year's schedule than any musician has ever 
before accumulated. He hopped over the Berlin Wall during its demolition, 
played one night stands in Moscow and Prague, wrapped his first major movie 
acting role ("Winter in Lisbon"), and played dates in Argentina, Brazil, Cuba, 
Chile, Denmark, England, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, Namibia, the 
Netherlands, Newfoundland, Puerto Rico and Switzerland. Honors have been 
showering on him like confetti, climaxed by the Kennedy Center Award earlier 
this month. Through it all, he has graciously spread the word for a music he 
has come to symbolize. Best CDs are on Pablo and Verve. 
</P>
<P>
VIRTUOSO OF THE YEAR: Eddie Daniels. Dual-handedly, this man has brought the 
clarinet back to its rightful place with a series of albums that displayed his 
astonishing emotional and technical power. At a recent Los Angeles concert, 
teamed with pianist Mike Garson, he opened with Poulenc and Von Weber, closed 
with Miles Davis and Sonny Rollins, proving that classical listeners are now 
receptive to the serious presentation of jazz -- and vice versa. Several albums 
in diverse idioms on GRP Records. 
</P>
<P>
SMALL GROUP OF THE YEAR: The Harper Brothers Quintet. Drummer Winard Harper, 
27, and trumpeter Philip Harper, 24, offered renewed evidence that in an era 
almost overwhelmed by funk and fusion, unhyphenated acoustic hard bop shall not 
perish from the earth. "The Harper Brothers" and "The Harper Brothers: 
Remembrance" on Verve Records. 
</P>
<P>
VOCAL GROUP OF THE YEAR: Inner Voices. Organized by Morgan Ames, this 
four-women a cappella unit is a female counterpart to Take 6 in the beauty of 
its blend and the ingenuity of its arrangements. Only one album, a Christmas 
set just released on Rhino. 
</P>
<P>
YOUNG MAN OF THE YEAR: Ryan Kisor. No, you have not heard of him, but it won't 
be long. He is the astonishingly fluent 17-year-old high school student from 
Sioux City, Iowa, who last month won first prize at the Thelonious Monk 
Institute's Louis Armstrong Trumpet Competition, held at the Smithsonian in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
FATHER OF THE YEAR: Ellis Marsalis. Need we say more? 
</P>
<P>
ALBUM OF THE YEAR (Instrumental): Stan Getz, "Anniversary" (EmArcy). The tenor 
sax, always a supremely adaptable horn, was never more sublime than in Getz's 
hands during this live session at a Copenhagen club. Incomparable backing by 
Kenny Barron, piano; Rufus Reid, bass and Victor Lewis, drums. 
</P>
<P>
ALBUM OF THE YEAR (Vocal): Carmen McRae, "McRae Sings Monk" (RCA Novus). With 
15 Thelonious themes, set to ingenious lyrics furnished by Jon Hendricks and 
others, and with a singer who knows Monk inside out, this could scarcely miss. 
</P>
<P>
RECORD COMPANY OF THE YEAR: Mosaic. Devoted to painstaking reissues in 
high-class, high-priced box sets, this mail order outfit has earned a unique 
reputation. This year it made available most of the classic Commodore Records 
catalogue, and last month the legendary Charlie Parker tapes preserved by the 
late Dean Benedetti. No, your local store won't help; try 35 Melrose Place, 
Stamford, Conn. 06902. 
</P>
<P>
JAZZ MOVIE OF THE YEAR: A tough call. "Mo' Better Blues" boasted a splendid 
sound track, but the plot fell apart. "Listen Up: The Lives of Quincy Jones" 
was a farrago of three-second sound-and-sight bites that seemed to equate rap 
with jazz. It seems only fair to hold the award for "Benny Carter: Symphony in 
Riffs." Though to date it has been shown mainly in England and awaits a wide 
release here, it is just what a one-hour documentary on a jazz giant should be: 
musically and historically valuable. 
</P>
<P>
BIG BAND OF THE YEAR: The surviving big bands seem to consist of two classes: 
those that work year-round and are aimed mainly at the nostalgia crowd, and 
those that work sporadically because their music is ahead of the public's 
attention span. In the first category are the ghost bands of Glenn Miller, 
Tommy Dorsey et al.; also the not-quite-ghost bands led by Frank Foster and 
Mercer Ellington under the names of Count Basie and Duke Ellington. 
</P>
<P>
The second group comprises part-time orchestras led by, among others, Louis 
Bellson, Toshiko Akiyoshi, Bill Berry, Bill Holman, the Frank Capp/Nat Pierce 
Juggernaut -- all heard too seldom in-person or on records. 
</P>
<P>
The award goes to a band heard even less frequently, the admirable 
Clayton-Hamilton Orchestra. Ignored by East Coast critics who never check out 
the Los Angeles scene, this ensemble owes its success to the multiple talents 
of the bassist-composer/arranger-conductor John Clayton, and to his partners, 
brother Jeff Clayton (saxes) and Jeff Hamilton (drums). They have only two 
albums out, one backing singer Ernestine Anderson, and a far more 
representative instrumental set, "Groove Shop" (Capri). 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- 
</P>
<P>
It was a year when modest talents too often earned immodest rewards. Harry 
Connick Jr. is now a giant record seller and a motion picture actor, while Eric 
Reed, a major pianist now with Wynton Marsalis, and Kenny Colman, one of the 
finest singers in the Sinatra tradition, go all but unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
Again, blue notes abounded during a year that said adieu to Sarah Vaughan, June 
Christy, Emily Remler, Pearl Bailey, Major Holley, Lee Castle, Al Sears, Mel 
Lewis, Dexter Gordon, Art Blakey, Walter Davis Jr., Bill Hardman and too many 
others. But as long as the Ryan Kisors and other players (and singers) of his 
generation continue to flow out of the colleges and conservatories, our hopes 
for the future remains strong.

ROCK VETERANS OUTSCORE THE NEWCOMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Has rock's youth movement hit the wall? 
</P>
<P>
With the exception of winner Sinead O'Connor, the English band World Party and 
two rap entries, The Times' consensus best albums of 1990 are from artists 
whose combined discographies would be as thick as the Westside telephone 
directory. Even Sonic Youth, the most adventurous occupant of the Top 10, has a 
back catalogue of nine albums. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, by contrast, six of the Top 10 were debuts (N.W.A., Neneh Cherry, 
Tone Loc, De La Soul) or second albums (Fine Young Cannibals, Peter Case). The 
only debuts this year are the two rap albums, by Ice Cube and Digital 
Underground. 
</P>
<P>
The persistence of patriarchs like Neil Young (whose "Freedom" topped last 
year's poll), Van Morrison, Paul Simon and Lou Reed reflects not only their own 
continuing or renewed inspiration, but also less-than-overwhelming efforts by 
such usual critics' pets as Prince, the Replacements and Los Lobos -- and the 
inactivity of such others as R.E.M. and U2. 
</P>
<P>
Rap might have been the most vital area of pop music last year, but only Ice 
Cube and Digital Underground represent the genre in the best-album voting. 
Conspicuously absent are "Fear of a Black Planet," by the critically admired 
Public Enemy, and the two albums that burned up the charts: M.C. Hammer's 
"Please Hammer Don't Hurt 'Em" and Vanilla Ice's "To the Extreme." 
</P>
<P>
Albums are awarded 10 points for each first-place vote, nine for second and so 
forth. Here are The Times' pop music critics' first-place choices for 1990

STOP THE ART WORLD AND LET 1990 OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
Armand Hammer opened a marble monument to himself in Westwood on Nov. 28, then 
died a scant 12 days later at the age of 92. There was a strange sense of 
tragic failure about the event, of aspirations to nobility sullied by an excess 
of ambition. 
</P>
<P>
Had he remained a County Museum of Art loyalist and bequeathed his collection 
there as long promised, he would have been a hero. The act would have added a 
grace note of modesty to his colorful self-aggrandizement. The gesture would 
have said he realized his compendium, despite its bright patches, better served 
the community as part of the community. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, like some minor Pharaoh, he built his private mastaba. At worst it 
will become a kind of landmark to an era of opulent egotism. Properly nurtured, 
it might yet serve Hammer's philanthropic impulse. It has, after all, already 
brought us a rare retrospective of the art of Russian avant-garde pioneer 
Kazimir Malevich. 
</P>
<P>
The Hammer scenario had larger reverberations. It somehow captured the spirit 
of the art world in 1990, glittering and guttering under the breath of mixed 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
Generally speaking, years are like elevators going up in a 12-story building. 
At every floor the doors open and the climate in the box alters a bit as the 
mix of passengers changes. The muse of spring enters shyly smiling, then 
departs to make way for the ravishing beauty of summer. There is a certain 
regularity. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the end of the century was the most chaotic twelvemonth since 
the close of World War II. The entire planet rattled and fluxed. In the arts, 
the battle over censorship at the National Endowment for the Arts grated on 
like a car alarm at midnight. As the elevator stopped at every floor, there was 
a sense the new passenger was either Cotton Mather, Black Friday or a tornado. 
</P>
<P>
Out, please. 
</P>
<P>
This is all very exciting but it's wearing me thin. I need to get out of the 
fray for a breather. Immersing one's head in a museum, a good gallery or a nice 
art book helps get it back together. Art tends to nurture long thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Art remained a prescription for correcting one's internal gyroscope. It seduced 
us with the reminder that humans can add to nature's sheer visual beauty in 
County Museum of Art exhibitions of the Annenberg collection and "The Fauve 
Landscape." The museum's small, scholarly show of three versions of Chardin's 
"Soap Bubbles" had nice things to say about how art rewards fine discrimination 
with nuances of meaning. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona College did a keen little show called "The Art of the Forger," which 
wound up being about the need for authenticity in an ersatz society. UC Irvine 
acted as host for a traveling exhibition of antiquities lovingly collected by 
Sigmund Freud. The ensemble showed the ancient way the hidden human spirit 
makes itself visible in its symbols. 
</P>
<P>
Ah, good old art. 
</P>
<P>
For those who take it seriously, art has long functioned as a kind of 
substitute religion. Going in, its votaries take vows of chastity, poverty and 
obedience. But, like any religion that has to exist in the real world, the art 
cult is subject to adulteration. The edifice embraces factions from humble 
student monks doing their thing out of love to venal cardinals in it for pomp 
and power. 1990 was a kind of Baroque apogee of art as a spectacular cathedral 
of cynicism and greed. 
</P>
<P>
The faithful did not like it when holy relics like Van Gogh's "Portrait of Dr. 
Gachet" and Renoir's "Au Moulin de la Galette" were transformed into symbols of 
luxurious avarice and sold at auction for $82.5 and $78.1 million, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
It felt good when the J. Paul Getty Museum acquired Van Gogh's "Irises," 
refused to disclose the price and put the lovely, troubled thing back on public 
view where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
It felt better when the fall auction market took a dive. Maybe now works of art 
will stop being viewed as bedizened status symbols and go back to being merely 
priceless. 
</P>
<P>
How can art be a religion and a business at the same time? 
</P>
<P>
The same way televangelism can, I suppose. 
</P>
<P>
As far as art biz was concerned it looked like a peak year. Galleries flocked 
to town faster than you could count them. People stopped asking if L.A. is an 
art center when it became self-evident. All the same, by year's end rumors were 
rife that gallery business was sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
Why wouldn't it be sluggish? Every other day the news is that the country is in 
a recession. 
</P>
<P>
Reality had a way of sticking its nose into the sacred precincts. This is not 
necessarily a bad thing. Art is not about escaping from life, it's about 
understanding it. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to glasnost we have Malevich in Westwood. New York's Metropolitan Museum 
showed the Russian taste for French painting in "From Poussin to Matisse." 
Hebrew Union College presented "Tradition and Revolution," a revelatory 
exhibition about a heretofore ignored Jewish avant-garde in Russia. USC's 
Soviet underground show, "Keepers of the Flame," provided more evidence of the 
great thaw, if not great quality. In Seattle, "Art Into Life" showed the 
revolutionary vigor of the original avant-garde while Tacoma presented the work 
of recent pre-glasnost Russian underground art in "Spring Into Summer." 
</P>
<P>
Japan grew as a world power and LACMA presented "A Primal Spirit." Fascinating 
show. Contemporary Japanese sculptors working in large scale are blending 
traditional aesthetic involvement with materials and nature into the art of the 
international mainstream. 
</P>
<P>
Next thing you know Tokyo's Fuji Museum buys the entire photo collection of 
L.A. dealer Stephen White. 
</P>
<P>
Germany headed for reunification. German painter Gerhard Richter promptly 
appeared at the Lannan Foundation. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art 
presented the first American survey of German painter Sigmar Polke. LACMA 
presented "Envisioning America," a deeply engaging look at prints expressing 
Weimar Republic artists' fantasies about the United States, followed by Die 
Brucke prints. (Early next year comes perhaps the most anticipated show ever 
originated in L.A., Stephanie Barron's re-creation of Hitler's notorious 1937 
"Degenerate Art" exhibition.) 
</P>
<P>
For better and for worse, 1990 was the year art was increasingly used to 
illustrate social and political themes and further their causes. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes this works well. The catalogue essay for "Monet in the '90s" at 
Boston's Museum of Fine Arts exposed a lot of fascinating subtext about his 
relation to the politics and social trends of his times. But demonstrating 
relationships between art and reality don't always work that well. 
</P>
<P>
Nothing creates a greater ethical dilemma than finding two worthy sets of 
values at loggerheads. In a burgeoning multicultural society, previously muted 
voices want to be heard and should be. To this end, Washington's Corcoran 
Gallery presented "Facing History," an exhibition that purported to expose 
prejudice towards blacks in traditional American art. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA chalked up sociologically bent shows with 
</P>
<P>
"Art/Artifact" and "CARA." The first was a rather oblique look at the way 
African art is displayed. The second -- a survey of Chicano art from 1965-85 -- 
had moments of touching and gritty excellence. 
</P>
<P>
Each in its way had good intentions about exposing negative stereotyping or 
bringing attention to ignored artists. All to the good, but artistic questions 
must still be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
The "quality" issue haunted the entire art sphere in 1990, from the Hammer 
Museum to the Mapplethorpe affair. Fostering quality in a disinterested way has 
been the goal of the arts across centuries and cultures. "Quality" doesn't mean 
the slickest or the prettiest. It can mean the ugliest or the scariest. The 
most potent. 
</P>
<P>
The only goal of the quest for quality is identifying expressive eloquence. 
Nobody rejects a Tiepolo ceiling as Catholic propaganda, a Michelangelo 
sculpture as homosexual advocacy or a winged Assyrian bull as absolutist art. 
Real art lovers would rather cut off their noses than spurn an eloquent work 
for any reason external to the thing in itself. 
</P>
<P>
Had the quality issue remained further to the front it might have provided some 
detachment in the nasty battle over restricting the NEA. When the Robert 
Mapplethorpe exhibition that kicked off the whole ominous controversy turned up 
at UC Berkeley, one thing came clear: The work can be attached to important 
issues of expressive freedom but artistically it is just not outstanding or 
original enough to rate all the fuss. 
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, in Los Angeles, a town that puts so much stock in being a now 
sort of place, the role of contemporary art was less a starring than a 
supporting one this year. One suspects this was due partly to the fact that 
aesthetic questions tended be outshouted by newsier real world issues. 
</P>
<P>
Art played but a minor role in the Los Angeles Festival. The Laguna Art Museum 
presented "Turning the Tide," which showed we are finally doing something about 
the history of modernism in L.A. before 1960. The Museum of Contemporary Art 
had already given a boost to local architectural history with its survey of the 
seminal Case Study Houses. 
</P>
<P>
MOCA's greatly anticipated retrospective of the influential John Baldessari 
found the artist intelligent, humorous and insightful, but unexpectedly thin 
and excessively accessible. The museum was disappointed by rather poor 
attendance figures for the reputedly popular figure. It is liable to not be 
disappointed by its current survey of Ed Ruscha's art. The new black paintings 
represent a quantum leap in maturity and expressive gravity for an artist once 
seen as a hip L.A. entertainer. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from that, contemporary museum shows largely failed to provide bellwether 
insights, other than reflecting the alternately esoteric and excessively 
media-oriented state of the art. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously enough, the art events that provided the greatest sense of the 
present were about American art in the past. By coincidence, early in the year 
everyone was reading a new and controversial biography of Jackson Pollock as a 
retrospective of his mentor Thomas Hart Benton appeared at the County Museum of 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
The confluence reminded everyone of the unruly, risky, rabid way real art gets 
made. The often-scorned Regionalist Benton suddenly looked both heroic and 
historically inevitable. Struggling for their art in Depression America, the 
pair provided radically contrasting exemplars of art that grows out of troubled 
times. 
</P>
<P>
Well, if trouble is good aesthetic fertilizer, it looks like art should get 
better in 1991.

BAPTISM'S LONG LINES AND EXPENSES MAKE SPIRITUAL STEP BIG BUSINESS 
</P>

Every Saturday dozens of toddler and infant boys in white tie and tails and 
girls in flowing white christening gowns fill the pews at Mary Immaculate 
Church in Pacoima, waiting their turn for the splash of holy water that will 
mark their entry into the Roman Catholic Church. 
</P>
<P>
Overwhelmed by sheer numbers and the children's squawks and screams, the priest 
conducting the ceremony gets straight to the point. He reminds parents of their 
commitment to raising their child in the church and warns them against using 
the occasion an an excuse for overindulgence. 
</P>
<P>
Then, row by row, with recorded Mexican folk music playing in the background, 
parents and godparents line up to approach the priest to receive the sacrament 
as cameras flash and camcorders roll. 
</P>
<P>
Later, the many families head off to catered private parties at rented halls 
that, despite the priest's admonition, include plenty of drinking and dancing 
well into the night. 
</P>
<P>
In most Anglo parishes and English-speaking Protestant churches, small numbers 
of children are baptized at regular services once a month. But in churches 
serving Latino communities, the ceremony has shifted to a special Saturday 
night service and has become almost an assembly-line operation conducted 
weekly. Church officials said the mass baptisms began about a decade ago as a 
result of immigration and a high birth rate among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
Mary Immaculate is typical of Spanish-speaking parishes, where baptism ranks 
alongside quinceaneras -- the coming-out party for 15-year-old girls -- 
weddings and funerals as life's most significant milestones. 
</P>
<P>
"In our community baptism is seen as essential when a child comes into a 
family," said Father Bill Antone, a priest at Mary Immaculate. "It is a must in 
a traditional way, where in more Anglicized communities it is viewed more as an 
option." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its spiritual significance, baptism is big business in the 
Latino community, said Jose Pimentel, a salesman at Lilian's Bridal and Tuxedo 
Shop in San Fernando, where the pricey kiddie tuxedos and gowns are sold. The 
reason is simple. "Every child has to be baptized," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Several San Fernando shop owners specializing in baptism apparel and 
accessories refused to talk about the trade, either out of suspicion or 
competitiveness. 
</P>
<P>
But the price tags at the shops tell much of the story. The little boys' 
tuxedos start at $50, while the more elaborate girls' christening outfits made 
of lace can cost more than $100. Add to that the fee for renting a local hall, 
as well as the tab for food, drinks, a photographer, a band, sheet cake, 
invitations, party favors and decorations, and the bill can reach several 
thousand dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Carlotta Valdez, one of the owners of Valdez Dance Hall in Pacoima, said 
weddings and baptisms make up most of her business. The hall rents for $900, 
but that includes cleaning, guards, tables and chairs. "You have to bring your 
own decorations," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Martha Diego, whose son, Pedro Jesus, was baptized at Mary Immaculate last 
month, saved and planned for several months for the event. With the boy's 
godparents covering part of the cost, she spent more than $2,000 for her son's 
party, which was held at the local veteran's hall and featured a live band and 
disc jockey. 
</P>
<P>
"He's my only son," said Diego, a cafeteria worker born in Guadalajara. "All 
Mexican people have parties like that." 
</P>
<P>
A photographer hired for the event shot pictures of Diego and her son, as well 
as group shots of the friends and relatives who attended the service and the 
reception. Outside the church, other hired photographers posed their groups of 
customers around the parish grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Father David Ullrich, of the Santa Rosa Catholic Church in San Fernando, said 
the social aspects of baptism sometimes overshadow its religious meaning. But 
trying to persuade parishioners to skip the elaborate parties is nearly 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
"You might as well talk to the wind," said Ullrich, whose church is affiliated 
with Mary Immaculate. "We try to encourage simplicity, and not everyone is 
extravagant, but like weddings, there is a certain way people want to do it. 
Usually individual preferences will hold reign over religious values." 
</P>
<P>
Officially, the Los Angeles archdiocese has no position on what sort of 
celebration is appropriate for a child's baptism, said spokesman Father Gregory 
Coiro. 
</P>
<P>
"The proper advice is that this is primarily a spiritual event and one should 
not go into debt over it," Coiro said. "But there is no way for the church to 
legislate that and if someone wants a big celebration, there is no way for the 
church to prevent it." 
</P>
<P>
Last year, more than 70,000 adults and children were baptized as Catholics, 
Coiro said. That is about 10,000 more than were being baptized a decade ago, 
church records show. 
</P>
<P>
"There has been growth in Hispanic membership in the church, not only from 
births and baptism but from a constant influx from Mexico and the rest of Latin 
America," Coiro said. 
</P>
<P>
Father Antone, of Mary Immaculate, said when the parish was founded in 1954 it 
had a predominantly Anglo membership. That changed dramatically in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
"Now we have 11 Masses over a weekend, four in English and seven in Spanish," 
Antone said. "We have 7,000 to 8,000 attending over a weekend. The Spanish 
Masses are standing room only." 
</P>
<P>
Antone said he and his two other colleagues at Mary Immaculate are sometimes 
overwhelmed by the growth of the church, with as many as 45 children being 
baptized a week. 
</P>
<P>
"Every once in a while we complain about the parking and the crowds and the 
noise but in the long run we feel really blessed," Antone said.

4 VICTIMS OF TRAIN-CAR COLLISION IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The four victims killed in a collision Friday between a car and a train in 
Chatsworth were identified Saturday as Canoga Park High School students. 
</P>
<P>
The dead students, all residents of Canoga Park, were Troung Lam, 17; Quang 
Lam, 18; Long Nguyen, 16, and Vinh Vo, 17, Los Angeles County coroner's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A passenger train struck a car occupied by the youths Friday as the vehicle 
passed through a railroad crossing on Lassen Street, a block west of Canoga 
Avenue, police said. Witnesses said the car apparently was trying to beat the 
train to the crossing, and that the car's driver ignored flashing red lights 
and swerved around two cars that had stopped at the crossing. 
</P>
<P>
Troung Lam, Quang Lam and Nguyen were pronounced dead at the scene. Vo died 
Friday about 10 p.m. after surgery at Northridge Hospital Medical Center, the 
coroner's office said. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of the crash threw the teen-agers from the car, which was smashed 
nearly beyond recognition, officials said. The train was loaded with passengers 
heading toward Northern California and Seattle for the Christmas holidays, 
officials said.

SANTA A TOURIST ATTRACTION AT FARMERS MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB POOL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Surrounded by crowds of excited teen-agers and exploding flashbulbs, I 
experienced Los Angeles' latest tourist attraction the other day in the Fairfax 
District. Me. 
</P>
<P>
Well, not me, exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Claus was the focus of attention from Japanese visitors who piled by the 
busload into Farmers Market. That is where I was on rent-a-Santa duty to 
dispense candy canes and Christmas cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the visitors were young. And most pulled cameras from their pockets and 
purses and rushed me when they spied Santa strolling among the outdoor shopping 
center's famous food and fruit stands. 
</P>
<P>
Each wanted a picture taken standing next to Santa No Ojisan -- that jolly old 
man in the red suit. 
</P>
<P>
"Santa Claus is very famous in Japan," said tour guide Ken Kanazawa. "He's in 
many movies and on TV." 
</P>
<P>
The visitors explained that Christmas is known as seinaru hi in Japan -- a holy 
day in some parts of the world that is more of a fun day for Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
The day is much the same for some locals who frequent the 56-year-old 
marketplace, near one of Los Angeles' oldest Jewish neighborhoods. Many of the 
20,000 or so who stop off at Farmers Market each day are more likely to 
celebrate Hanukkah than Christmas at home. 
</P>
<P>
For that reason, I was nervous when I was first told I was being sent on a 
four-hour Santa shift there -- even after officials of Western Temporary 
Services assured me that they often recruit Jewish Santas for seasonal work at 
shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
But my worries evaporated two weeks ago while on a Santa assignment at a mall 
in Manhattan Beach. That day, a group from Congregation Tifereth Jacob was 
conducting a menorah-lighting ceremony across the food court from my Santa 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
When it was over, the rabbi's children, 5-year-old Marissa Hyman and her 
brother, Jonathan, 8, shyly waved at me. Then they came over and wished me 
happy holidays and handed me a tiny wooden dreidel -- a toy top that is a 
traditional symbol of Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers Market patrons treated Santa with the same kindness. 
</P>
<P>
Nora Handelman, Dorothy Levinson and Tillie Feinstein invited St. Nick to join 
them for coffee as they sat huddled against Thursday's unusually chilly weather 
in front of a marketplace doughnut shop. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein grabbed the bottom of my beard and lifted it up. "I want to see who's 
underneath there," she exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
Even the oldest of shoppers grinned when I stopped them to ask if they'd been 
good little girls or boys this year. They beamed when I reached into my candy 
cane bag to reward those who claimed to have been nice. 
</P>
<P>
I got a laugh when male shoppers happily confessed to being naughty. "Maybe 
Santa should give you the whole bag," I told them. 
</P>
<P>
When a 65ish woman who said her name was Doris demanded to know what Santa was 
bringing her this year, I suggested she sit on my knee and discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
To my surprise, she agreed. "This is the first time in my life I've ever sat on 
Santa's lap," Doris said. Her wish list included a cure for AIDS, rain for Los 
Angeles "and a man for me." 
</P>
<P>
Tourists at Farmers Market had different requests for Santa, however. 
</P>
<P>
Al Rolnick of Wilmette, Ill., was wishing for warmer sunshine for his Southern 
California visit. He could have stayed home if he wanted to be cold at 
Christmastime, he indicated. 
</P>
<P>
But Robyn Ford of New Zealand was looking for snow. It's summertime in 
Auckland, where she lives. Her family was stopping off briefly in Los Angeles 
on its way to Colorado for a skiing vacation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Vans and tour buses full of camera-wielding visitors were still pulling up when 
it came time for Santa to pull out. 
</P>
<P>
I changed out of my Santa suit and beard in market manager Sherif Barsoum's 
office before leaving. I hid the red suit in a bag. 
</P>
<P>
As I walked out wearing jeans and a sweater, I reflexively waved toward a new 
group of Japanese tourists flocking in from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
They ignored me.

MOTORIST'S TROUBLES BEGAN WHEN HE ARRIVED AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

William Henley almost made it home safely Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Whittier motorist, who authorities said apparently had been 
drinking, pulled into his driveway about 6 a.m. and kept going. He missed the 
garage door, the front door and ended up in his living room. 
</P>
<P>
Henley had just driven up to his home on Avoncroft Street, when he fell asleep, 
according to Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Michael Herek. 
</P>
<P>
Henley was not injured in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
"Henley did not even know he was in a crash," Herek said. "He stayed passed out 
through the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
Immediately after he plowed into the house, Henley unconsciously kept applying 
pressure on the accelerator, causing the engine to rev at high speed, Herek 
said. The engine overheated and caught fire. The living room also caught fire, 
as did parts of the kitchen and garage, Herek said. 
</P>
<P>
The crash woke Henley's wife, Laura, who thought it was an earthquake, Herek 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She said she started to roll over and go back to sleep," the sergeant added. 
</P>
<P>
But the unusual sound of water flowing through the living room caught her 
attention, Herek said. A water spigot had also fallen victim to the errant car 
and driver, and spewed into the house. 
</P>
<P>
Laura Henley got up to find the family car on fire inside her living room, and 
her husband still asleep behind the wheel, Herek said. She woke her husband, 
their four young children, the children's grandmother and the family dog, and 
together they watched as fire caused $76,000 damage to their home, Herek said. 
</P>
<P>
No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
Henley was arrested on suspicion of drunk driving. He denied that he was 
intoxicated and refused a breath test to determine if he exceeded the 
blood-alcohol limit of .08%, Herek said. Henley was held at the Pico Rivera 
sheriff's station jail. 
</P>
<P>
In the first 12 hours of the Christmas holiday weekend, at least 300 other 
drivers in Los Angeles County were arrested for allegedly driving while 
intoxicated, authorities said.

SURGEON TIRES OF EFFORT TO PLUG GAP IN TRAUMA CARE; 
</P>
<P>
HOSPITALS: A DOCTOR ON CALL IN EMERGENCY ROOMS SAYS THAT DISINTEGRATION OF THE 
NETWORK PUTS INCREASING STRESS ON THOSE WHO PICK UP THE SLACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE C. ROARK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When it was created in 1983, the trauma care network in Los Angeles County was 
hailed as the finest emergency medical response system in the nation. Based on 
trauma care developed during the Vietnam War, 22 hospitals, strategically 
located throughout the county, were equipped with the best technology and 
staffed 24 hours a day to respond instantly to life-threatening injuries. 
Highly trained emergency room doctors, surgeons, anesthesiologists and other 
specialists stood ready to treat the victims of car crashes, industrial 
accidents and urban crime. 
</P>
<P>
Now, by all accounts, that system has all but collapsed. Faced with increasing 
violence on city streets, a growing population of poor, uninsured patients, 
rising medical costs and, from the beginning, inadequate public funds to pay 
for indigent patients, nearly half of the hospitals have pulled out of the 
system, increasingly leaving the county's other 80 hospitals with emergency 
rooms to deal with trauma cases. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors are leaving emergency medicine in droves, but one who has hung on is 
Dr. Robert Pereyra, a 40-year-old vascular surgeon who was trained at Loma 
Linda Medical School, Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles and Cedars-Sinai 
Medical Center. Now in private practice in Glendale with a group of seven other 
surgeons, Pereyra does elective operations and is on call for emergency surgery 
at two private facilities: Glendale Adventist Medical Center and White Memorial 
Medical Center, where he is chief of surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Although not technically part of the trauma-care network, the doctors who work 
-- often without pay -- in these hospitals are picking up some of the slack of 
the embattled public emergency care system. It is a job that for a number of 
years has brought Pereyra considerable professional satisfaction, but at a 
personal cost that is becoming increasingly hard to bear. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What is your role in the trauma network? Do you consider yourself a trauma 
doctor? 
</P>
<P>
A: My speciality is vascular surgery. . . . Forty or 50% of my cases involve 
fixing arteries on people with arteriosclerosis . . . 20 or 30% preparing (the 
veins of) patients who are about to undergo (kidney) dialysis. . . . The rest 
is emergency general surgery and trauma care. . . . I am not a trauma 
specialist. No one in our group is a trauma specialist, but the nature of our 
practice, working in inner-city hospitals, and the nature of our training, as 
surgeons, meant we were good at it to start with, and we have maintained 
competence in it because we end up doing a fair amount of it. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do White Memorial and Glendale Adventist have trauma patients if they 
are not officially part of the trauma network? 
</P>
<P>
A: It's a matter of where they are located. At White Memorial, we're in one of 
the poorest areas of the city . . . a lot of the residents are illegal aliens. 
. . . We have about four or five big freeway interchanges surrounding us. We 
get a lot of injuries from there. We're very close to the Vernon-South 
Gate-South L. A. industrial area. We get a lot of stuff from there. And we're 
unfortunately in the middle of a lot of urban warfare. . . . Everything that is 
wrong with trauma in L.A. is very clearly seen at White Memorial, just as it is 
at Big County (County-USC Medical Center), which is about six blocks away. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
In Glendale, the level of acuity (the severity of the injuries) may not be as 
great, but there are other problems. . . . Glendale Adventist serves Glendale, 
where there is a lot of civilian violence and also the Highland Park-Eagle Rock 
area, where there happen to be a lot of . . . people who don't have insurance, 
and the ones who do are on Medi-Cal which means they have very little money and 
are prone to serious health problems. 
</P>
<P>
Q: How do trauma patients get to you? 
</P>
<P>
A: What happens is that we do a combination of trauma care and other 
emergencies that the county facilities simply can't handle. . . . MAC (the 
county's central telephone communication system, which directs ambulances to 
hospitals) will call and ask us if there is an OR (operating room) available . 
. . if there is a surgeon in house. They'll ask, "Are you prepared to accept an 
ambulance run with a critical trauma victim because County (County-USC Medical 
Center) is overloaded." Appendectomies and bowel obstructions will be stacked 
up at Big County in the hall. . . . I'll also get a call directly from a 
resident who'll say, "I've got this appy (a patient with appendicitis) who has 
been sitting in the hall for 16 hours, and he's got insurance. Can you do 
anything?" 
</P>
<P>
Q: Even though theoretically the county is supposed to send you only patients 
with insurance or guarantee payment for those patients who aren't insured, you 
in fact aren't always paid, are you? 
</P>
<P>
A: I'd say, of the emergency surgery we do in my group, fewer than a fourth 
have some kind of insurance, whether it's an emergency because of acute 
appendicitis or a bowel obstruction or a gunshot wound. Of the trauma patients 
we see, almost none has insurance, maybe 10 or at most 20%. . . . What happens 
is we attempt to transfer that patient to a hospital where there are salaried 
doctors on staff to treat indigent patients. We call the MAC center, but 
they'll tell us, "All county beds are full. . . ." So you end up taking care of 
them and, if you are a private physician working in a private hospital, you 
take care of them for free. The hospital doesn't pay us anything. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Despite what it costs you, does the system work for the patient? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sometimes in private, non-trauma hospitals the patients get better care 
because they'll have a regular surgeon, not a resident, working on them. But 
sometimes we get patients we simply aren't prepared for. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Can you think of an example? 
</P>
<P>
A: The last night I was on call, I did a thoracotomy (a chest operation) for 
stab wounds to the chest. The guy died. I cut his chest open. He had a big hole 
in his heart. That depresses you because technologically we probably had the 
horsepower to save that guy, but we're not a trauma center. . . . He was 
dropped off in the main lobby at White Memorial Hospital. If they had dropped 
him at the emergency room of County, he might have survived because they can 
mobilize a large group of people that we may or may not have. Here, the time of 
day dictates who is available and what can be done. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Who was the patient? And why was he directed to White Memorial in the first 
place? 
</P>
<P>
A: When I say dropped off, I mean somebody drove by and opened the door, threw 
him out and streaked. We got a lot of that. Dump and run. And they're usually 
hurt in some gang-related thing or some drug-related thing. Lots of dump and 
run. Every week. . . . It turned out this particular guy was an illegal alien 
who got on the wrong end of a drug deal. I had already done an appy for free on 
an illegal alien earlier that night, which is why I was still in the hospital. 
If I hadn't been in the hospital when that guy came in the front door, he would 
have been pronounced dead instantly. The ER docs simply couldn't have dealt 
with him. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about the patients who survive? Are they thankful for what you do? 
</P>
<P>
A: A lot of the patients are very grateful. But we also get a lot of difficult 
patients. They leave against advice, and they cuss at you as soon as the tube 
comes out of their mouth. We had one patient recently who I am sure would have 
died if a sub-specialist vascular surgeon hadn't been immediately available. . 
. . The guy got slashed across the throat in a drug deal. . . . His carotid 
artery got chopped off. He was bleeding to death. The paramedics did a great 
job. They got him to us alive. . . . We fixed that artery. It was really an 
exciting case. It was really neat to do. . . . But the next day he pulled the 
tube out himself, realized he was OK, ripped out all of his equipment and just 
disappeared. Now that was probably $5,000 worth of service to him that was 
really expert service. . . . We didn't even get the satisfaction of him saying, 
"Thanks, guys, you did a great job, and I appreciate it." 
</P>
<P>
Q: Given who many of your trauma patients are -- drug dealers, gang members, 
illegal aliens -- why should taxpayers, who ultimately foot the bill, either 
through taxes or their own health insurance premiums, care whether the county's 
trauma system works or not? 
</P>
<P>
A: Because anyone at any time can become a trauma victim. There are basically 
three ways you come to be a trauma patient. You are in an industrial accident 
at work. . . . You are in an automobile accident or have a recreational 
accident, skiing, hiking in the woods, whatever. . . . Or you get caught in 
some civilian violence. That may be the Saturday night knife-and-gun club. But 
you also may be the innocent victim of a mugging. You may simply be in the 
wrong place at the wrong time, when some random shooting occurs. And that is 
increasingly happening all over. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What can be done to rebuild the system -- or at least to keep it from 
deteriorating further? 
</P>
<P>
A: What is ironic about this is, L.A. County has in place the facilities and 
the people to have the best trauma program anywhere. . . . The problem is, it's 
the only (county) in the U.S. where there aren't major bucks being pumped in. . 
. . I don't know whose fault it is. But I do know what the solution is. . . . 
If it was profitable to do trauma care, everybody would want to do it, and they 
would do it better. But it's not profitable. We have made a social decision 
we'd rather not pay taxes to support trauma care. . . . As it was conceived, 
the L.A. County trauma system was super, but as it works out, it is a financial 
disaster. . . . Hospital after hospital has dropped out. . . . Doctors, who 
used to sue each other to get on emergency room panels because it was 
prestigious and because they could build a practice that way, are now resigning 
in droves simply because they aren't being paid. 
</P>
<P>
Q: What about you? If conditions stay as they are, will you move on with the 
rest of them? 
</P>
<P>
A: I've certainly given it a lot of thought. . . . A lot of people are just 
opting out of inner-city practice. They are going to work for Kaiser. They are 
leaving L.A. and Southern California. They are limiting their practice to 
varicose veins. . . . There are fewer than 1,000 specialty certified vascular 
surgeons in this country, and there's a lot of openings for them in private 
practice and in teaching programs. So it's getting attractive to look 
elsewhere. . . . When I was a resident and didn't have to make a living and I 
didn't have kids, it was exciting. Now I've done all those things. I don't need 
to learn how any more. It's still interesting. It's satisfying to save 
somebody's life occasionally or to do something good for somebody, even for 
nothing. But then it cuts into your life so much. . . . You wonder if you 
should keep doing it. . . . And we're seeing worse and worse types of 
accidents. We're seeing a lot of drug-related stuff. We're seeing a lot of 
HIV-positive patients. Anybody who is a drug abuser has a high-percentage 
chance to be HIV positive. All these things sort of get into it. It's not 
viable financially. It's less and less desirable socially. It's just starting 
not to make sense.

TSARNAS HOT IN COLD WEATHER TO HELP ANAHEIM WIN IN SOCCER

Even Saturday night's chilly temperatures failed to slow Anaheim High School 
senior Mike Tsarnas, who scored twice in the Colonist soccer team's 2-0 victory 
over top-ranked Orange. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Anaheim (10-0-1), the fifth-ranked team in Orange County, the 
championship of the Orange tournament at Chapman College. 
</P>
<P>
The Panthers are 7-1-3. 
</P>
<P>
Tsarnas, who is being recruited by UCLA, kicked his 20th and 21st goals of the 
season five minutes into each half. His second goal was from 30 yards out. 
</P>
<P>
Orange's defense, led by goalkeeper Eric Jaime, had shut out nine opponents 
this season but was unable to contain Tsarnas, who scored 24 goals last season. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised it went in from so far out," Tsarnas said. "I didn't kick it 
that hard and the wind slowed it down a little but it curved the ball a little 
and faked out their goalie." 
</P>
<P>
After Tsarnas' first goal, Anaheim's defense denied Orange any clear shots 
until Juan Viveros' shot was stopped by goalkeeper Jose Torres with four 
minutes remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Orange sweeper Justin Zayas' apparent goal with 12 minutes remaining in the 
second half was disallowed when he was called for pushing the goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
"We were fired up, but we made too many mistakes," Orange Coach Ed Carrillo 
said. "That second goal should have never been made. TOM BIRSCHBACH

FOR THE WRONGLY CONVICTED, JIM MCCLOSKEY IS A CLERGYMAN AND GUMSHOE WHO OPENS 
THE PRISON DOOR

<P>
IN THE BASEMENT OF AN OFFICE building across the street from Princeton 
University, an iconoclastic Protestant minister is patiently searching through 
a box of files on a 17-year-old Los Angeles murder case. 
</P>
<P>
The case was solved long ago to the satisfaction of the police and the courts. 
Two men were convicted and are serving life terms. But James McCloskey, the 
only full-time operative of Centurion Ministries, and not incidentally one of 
the nation's best detectives, thinks they are the wrong men. "This is a classic 
frame," he declares. 
</P>
<P>
Finding what he was looking for in the box, McCloskey pulls out a letter 
written three years ago by one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
"I've written numbers, numbers and NUMBERS of letters like the one I am going 
to write you now," it began. "I've written to newspapers, '60 Minutes,' NAACP, 
law firms, senators, '20/20,' Phil Donahue, magazines, the FBI, Jesse Jackson 
and other organizations trying to arrest someone's interest in my case, with 
hopes of getting them involved to the point of conducting a thorough 
investigation that would turn up crucial evidence to set me free. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't have killed this guy . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I was incarcerated in the custody of the L.A. County Sheriff's dept., IN 
JAIL!!! when this crime happened!" 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey knows this sounds outrageous, but no more so than other similar 
claims that, astoundingly, have turned out to be true. A 48-year-old bachelor 
who considers himself a "radical disciple of Christ," McCloskey spends his days 
trying to redeem people who are not supposed to exist. They are the convicted 
innocent -- people, who, because of police or prosecutorial mistakes or 
corruption, incompetent defense attorneys, faulty or coerced eyewitness 
identifications or simple juror misjudgments, are convicted of crimes they did 
not commit. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey calls his ministry Centurion after the Roman soldier who, the Bible 
says, was stationed at the foot of the cross, looked up and remarked of Christ, 
"Surely this one must be innocent." 
</P>
<P>
He takes on only the most serious cases, involving people who have been 
sentenced to life imprisonment or condemned to die, whose appeals are exhausted 
or nearly so and who are too poor to hire investigative help. 
</P>
<P>
Supported by scant contributions from foundations, churches and a few 
businessmen, McCloskey promises the convicts that he will work for them, at no 
cost, until they are freed. But he also tells them he will abandon them in an 
instant if he discovers they have lied. 
</P>
<P>
His extraordinary dedication and investigative skills have resulted in the 
freeing of eight men and women serving life sentences or awaiting execution for 
rape or murder in Texas, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
His ministry is unique. And there is no secular organization in the United 
States that does similar work. 
</P>
<P>
"He investigates like no one I've ever met," says Dennis Cogan, a leading 
Philadelphia defense attorney, "and I've come into contact with top-flight 
police investigators, federal investigators and private investigators. He's 
single-minded in his dedication, not taken in by a sob story and wedded to one 
thing -- the truth." 
</P>
<P>
Cogan helped McCloskey secure the release early this year of Matthew Connor, a 
Philadelphia man wrongly imprisoned for a decade for the rape and stabbing 
murder of an 11-year-old girl. The Philadelphia district attorney's office, 
which agreed to re-investigate the case at McCloskey's urging, wound up asking 
a court to free Connor, with the district attorney himself saying, "The 
evidence isn't there to say he is guilty." 
</P>
<P>
Connor's release came during an extraordinary nine-month period in 1989 and 
early 1990 during which McCloskey obtained the releases of five inmates in 
three states. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Damaso Vega, was convicted of a 1980 murder of a teen-age girl in 
Monmouth County, N.J. He had stood in front of the trial judge who had 
sentenced him to prison for life in 1982 and declared: "I will eat a stone. I 
will eat dust. I will eat anything worse in the world for me to prove my 
innocence. I am not the man. I am innocent. I am not the man." 
</P>
<P>
No one, of course, had believed him. But McCloskey dug up enough evidence to 
show that Vega had been framed by witnesses who had lied because of pressure 
from a detective. The officer had also hidden evidence that pointed to the 
guilt of another. Confronted with this new evidence, New Jersey Superior Court 
Judge Robert Figarotta said: "There are many aspects of this case which 
truthfully terrify me." 
</P>
<P>
As for Vega, he says: "When I describe Mr. McCloskey, I always say the 
dictionary don't have words to describe how good is that man." 
</P>
<P>
MCCLOSKEY, WHO usually smokes only when he is alone at night, needs a cigarette 
during the day to talk about his failures. In one case, he says, he had to give 
up when he was unable to turn up new evidence. In another, he became convinced 
that the man he thought was innocent was actually guilty. In the most 
disheartening, he lost a convicted murderer to the electric chair when the 
state of Louisiana decided to put him to death, despite new evidence McCloskey 
turned up at the last minute that pointed to his possible innocence. 
</P>
<P>
In the Los Angeles case, the biggest frustration is not being able to prove 
conclusively that his correspondent was in jail at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
The murder occurred at 7 p.m. in the restroom of a South-Central Los Angeles 
gas station in 1973. Records show that Clarence Nathan Chance was indeed a 
prisoner at Men's Central Jail on the day of the murder, held on an assault 
charge. Records also show that the charge was dropped and that Chance was 
processed out of the jail downtown at 4:53 p.m. But no record has been found 
that shows how long it took for Chance to complete the processing and actually 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey tracked down the jailer who ran the tier on which Chance was housed, 
and the jailer recalled that pre-release procedures at the time would have 
meant an actual release anywhere from 45 minutes to four hours after 4:53 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
If the procedures took two hours or more, Chance would not have had time to 
meet up with his friend, who was also convicted of the murder, and travel to 
the gas station to kill the victim -- an off-duty Los Angeles County deputy 
sheriff whom he apparently had never met. But if the release procedures took 
significantly less than two hours, Chance could have had the time. The jailer 
who ran Chance's tier remembered Chance, who had been a trusty, but he could 
not remember how long the procedures took in Chance's case. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of precisely when Chance was released was not explored at his trial. 
Chance's then-defense attorney, Charles Pope, says Chance told him he was 
released around 5 p.m., not that he was in jail at the time of the crime. But 
the transcript of the trial shows Chance saying, "But I was in jail when it 
happened. I was in the new county jail." Chance, who, at his lawyer's urging, 
did not testify, told that to the judge just before he was taken away to 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Because there is a possibility that Chance was released in time to commit the 
murder, McCloskey has focused on the way police built what even they admit was 
a weak case. The police, McCloskey says, used witnesses who told "such a 
concocted story it amazes me." 
</P>
<P>
He began his investigation, as he does in every case, by making an exhaustive 
study of official records, looking particularly for witnesses' accounts that 
changed after repeated contacts with police. Such changes, he says, are often 
tip-offs that witnesses lied to get police off their backs. 
</P>
<P>
After his study, he traded his customary sport shirt and suspenders for a black 
shirt and a clerical collar and hit the streets. "The collar can be a great 
door opener," he says. Then he "just parachuted in on" the witnesses -- 
offering them a chance to redeem themselves by telling a lay minister the 
truth. 
</P>
<P>
He found, as he often does, that two of the key witnesses, who said Chance and 
a co-defendant had confessed, were "broken human beings . . . absolutely alone 
in the world." They admitted to McCloskey that they had lied to police because 
they were frightened and wanted to say what the police wanted to hear. Over the 
years, they had told no one of their lies, McCloskey says, because "who would 
believe them?" 
</P>
<P>
"Forgive me for sounding angry," McCloskey says as he recounts his findings, 
"but I am angry." He jabs at a table top with his finger. "I am (extremely) 
pissed when this happens!" 
</P>
<P>
A former business consultant who turned to the ministry in mid-life, McCloskey 
has an easy way with people. He is a bald, round-faced man, with a double chin, 
a slight paunch and a hearty, ready laugh. But he says these kinds of witnesses 
"don't just plunk out the truth. They have to come to like you, respect you, 
trust you, know that you are well-intentioned and not conning them in any way." 
Then, he says, it is usually "a long, delicate walk" before they will tell 
their stories to a judge. 
</P>
<P>
MCCLOSKEY'S MOST DRAMATIC breakthrough came in a Texas case, in which he was 
able to take a witness "back through the pain" of a police-inspired lie that 
put an innocent man on Death Row. McCloskey made sure he knew a lot about this 
witness -- wiry, white-haired John Henry Sessum -- by the time they met in 
early 1987 outside Sessum's two-room shack on the outskirts of Conroe, a small 
East Texas town. 
</P>
<P>
Sessum was an alcoholic who had lost his driver's license for drinking. Every 
day, on his way home from his job on a highway road crew, he would stop to buy 
two six-packs of 16-ounce beers, put them in the wire basket of his bike, then 
peddle the 10 miles home. 
</P>
<P>
Sessum, who is white, had been a key witness in 1980 against Clarence Brandley, 
who is black, in a racially charged murder case that had polarized the town. 
The murder victim was a 16-year-old white girl. 
</P>
<P>
Days before fall classes started at Conroe High School, she had gone to the 
school to practice volleyball and had wandered off alone, apparently in search 
of a restroom. Her body was found a short time later. She had been raped and 
strangled. 
</P>
<P>
The last people known to have seen the girl alive were school janitors -- white 
janitors, including Sessum, who had been waiting at the bottom of a stairway 
for their next assignment. Authorities promised panicky parents that they would 
have the girl's murder solved by the time school started. 
</P>
<P>
In a move a judge would later describe as "blind," they arrested Brandley, the 
only black janitor. Then they assembled Sessum and the rest of the white 
janitors for a talk. The white janitors, including Sessum, gave statements in 
one another's presence in which they said the girl had passed them and gone up 
the stairs to a restroom, that Brandley had then walked by and the white 
janitors had left. 
</P>
<P>
The implication was clear. Brandley was the only janitor who could have been 
alone with the girl and killed her. Largely on that basis, Brandley was 
convicted and sentenced to die. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey had gone to Death Row to visit Brandley -- he always visits inmates 
whose cases he may take -- but was reluctant to become involved. Brandley 
already had advocates. A supportive family, lawyers and another private 
investigator were already working on his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey prefers to work alone for inmates who have no help. But he was 
impressed with Brandley and convinced that he was innocent. And Brandley's 
defense team convinced him that the case was stalled, with time running out. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey moved into a garage apartment at the house of one of Brandley's 
lawyers, where he studied the case's transcripts and police reports. He 
concluded that Sessum, who had once complained about the lead police officer's 
tactics, was most likely the weakest link in the prosecution's case. And with 
only 20 days left until Brandley's execution, McCloskey, along with Brandley's 
investigator, Richard Reyna, went to see Sessum. 
</P>
<P>
They met him outside his shack. McCloskey remembers vividly because it smelled 
of urine. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'John,' " McCloskey recalls, beginning in his slightly ponderous way, 
" 'We think there's a good chance they got the wrong man. As you know, Clarence 
Brandley is going to be executed in two or three weeks. And we'd like to talk 
with you about whatever you might know about this.' We ended up standing in 
front of his house while he drank three or four 16-ounce cans of beers." 
</P>
<P>
Then, after two hours of cat and mouse, Sessum made a stunning proposition. He 
offered to take McCloskey and the investigator to the high school and show them 
what had occurred. "I got chills," McCloskey recalls. 
</P>
<P>
They met again, as agreed, in a few days. But when Sessum "got to the actual 
stairwell . . . (he) froze. He couldn't say a word." Later, at home, Sessum 
finally got a burst of inner strength and opened up. 
</P>
<P>
He told how two of the other white janitors had grabbed the girl and dragged 
her off and about how he had stood by and done nothing, ignoring her pleas for 
help. "He said, 'I let one innocent person go to her death, and I'm not going 
to let two," McCloskey recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But telling McCloskey that Brandley was innocent was not enough. McCloskey 
needed to get Sessum to tell his story to Brandley's lawyer on videotape, then 
to a judge. "It's like a sale now," says McCloskey. "You've got to close it." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey, Brandley's private investigator and his lawyer met at Sessum's house 
the next afternoon. The sale fell through. "John gives us a smile," McCloskey 
recalls. " 'Come in.' We come into his shack. He turns the TV on. We all sit 
down on his bed. He goes into the kitchen and comes out with a butcher knife, 
and just says 'Get the (expletive) out of here!' " 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey and the others left in despair but then thought of calling a friend 
of Sessum's -- a neighbor who they thought might be able to calm him down. As 
it turned out, Sessum was already at the neighbor's trailer. "She convinced him 
to settle down, 'Nothing's going to happen to you. These are good people. If 
that's the truth, why don't you give a statement?' " 
</P>
<P>
"We came back the next day and took a full 20-minute videotaped statement" in 
which Sessum said he had been intimidated into going along with the testimony 
of the other white janitors by the lead police officer, a Texas Ranger, 
McCloskey says. "He said the Ranger had told him, 'You go along with this or 
else you're going to jail.' " 
</P>
<P>
"That's a common line. They're all afraid of the law. And they have absolutely 
nobody who they can confide in who will in any way help them." But why should 
anyone believe Sessum now? McCloskey's answer is to look at whether he has a 
motive to lie. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps he recanted, McCloskey acknowledged, because he wanted to be perceived 
as a hero. But "if he sees this as an opportunity to become the hero, why would 
he take a butcher knife and tell us to get out? Because, I'll tell you why, 
he's scared to death. He still doesn't want to do it. And why would he, sitting 
on the edge of his bed, have tears rolling down his eyes when he is saying to 
us that he's had nightmares all these years? 
</P>
<P>
"His quote was, 'I guess I've got a little bit of the rabbit in me.' He runs 
away when there's trouble. . . . John Sessum had to stand up and tell a judge, 
TV cameras and an open public that he was a coward and let a girl go to her 
death without doing a thing. To me, there's a cost there. 
</P>
<P>
"And not only that. He feels terrible for lying against someone he knows is 
innocent and sending him away to the chair. I mean, he's (Sessum) a human 
being. And this is a chance for redemption, in the most profound way." 
</P>
<P>
A succession of Texas judges agreed with McCloskey. Sessum's videotaped 
statement was the beginning of the end of Brandley's troubles, leading to a 
stay of execution and then court-ordered freedom after 10 years behind bars. No 
one else was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
After District Court Judge Perry D. Pickett reviewed the case, he called it an 
extraordinary miscarriage of justice. "In the 30 years this court has presided 
over matters in the judicial system," he wrote, "no case has presented a more 
shocking scenario of the effects of racial prejudice, perjured testimony, 
witness intimidation, an investigation the outcome of which was predetermined, 
and public officials who, for whatever motives, lost sight of what is right and 
just." 
</P>
<P>
But for McCloskey, it was simply another case, the kind he runs into all the 
time. Despite this country's system of safeguards based on the philosophy that 
it is better to let a guilty man go free than to punish an innocent one, 
McCloskey believes that wrongful convictions occur with great regularity. Less 
than 10% of all criminal cases go before a jury; the vast majority are settled 
by pre-trial guilty pleas. McCloskey estimates "that one out of 10 who go to a 
jury trial are wrongly convicted." 
</P>
<P>
He thinks a big reason is that some jurors place too much faith in the 
integrity and thoroughness of police investigations. They do not truly believe 
that criminal defendants are entitled to be presumed innocent until proven 
guilty. "People come together in a courtroom and the (defendant's) sitting 
there. They think, 'Where there's smoke, there's fire,' " McCloskey says. " 
'The police wouldn't have brought this person to trial unless there was good 
reason.' And a lot of times there isn't." 
</P>
<P>
As for police in the cases he has investigated, he says, "I can't look you in 
the eye and say that (they) believed in their innermost person that these guys 
were innocent and set about to frame them. They built a case to fit their 
theory. A name (invariably that of someone with a criminal record) popped up as 
a suspect. And when information came their way that would lead them in a 
different direction, they ignored it. They hid it. And they also manufactured 
it to fit." 
</P>
<P>
SOCIALLY SMOOTH WHEN he wants to be, McCloskey has a sense of priorities that 
one friend says would make him leave in the middle of a sentence if his 
schedule called for it. The eldest of three children, he grew up in an 
affluent, church-going family in suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
His father, a Presbyterian church elder, was executive vice president of the 
family business, McCloskey &amp; Co., a large construction firm that changed 
much of Philadelphia's skyline and built one of the U.S. House of 
Representatives office buildings and Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in 
Washington, D.C. The firm was founded by McCloskey's great-uncle, Matthew, a 
powerful behind-the-scenes figure in the Democratic Party and a onetime U.S. 
ambassador to Ireland. But McCloskey had no interest in joining the firm. 
</P>
<P>
After college at Bucknell University, Navy service in Japan and combat in 
Vietnam, he returned to Japan as a civilian, helping U.S. companies negotiate 
joint ventures there, then striking out on his own in a venture to market 
galoshes. Unfortunately, Tokyo experienced a drought the year he decided to 
become a galoshes entrepreneur. "It never rained," he says. "It was 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
Back home, broke and disappointed, McCloskey went to work for the Hay Group, a 
prestigious Philadelphia consulting firm, where he specialized in advising 
Japanese companies who were doing business in the United States. By 1978, he 
was making $55,000 a year and had bought himself a house in the Main Line 
Philadelphia suburb of Malvern. He was on his way to a partnership that year 
when he announced that, at the age of 36, he felt selfish and wanted to leave, 
to study for the ministry. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey had started to attend church for the first time since high school a 
few years before, and the minister's preaching gradually "drove me into the 
Scriptures. As I'm reading the New Testament, I'm really starting to feel that 
Christ was speaking to me." 
</P>
<P>
"I was feeling an emptiness," McCloskey recalls. "The job and the business 
career were going well. But I didn't feel that I was doing anything really 
worthwhile. I've been a bachelor all my life. I (decided I) wanted to do 
something more with my life than just feed myself." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey deferred his departure from the business world for a year while he 
trained his replacement. Then he rented out his house and drove his Lincoln 
Continental to the Princeton Theological Seminary, where he checked into the 
dormitory. During his second year, he opted to do his field work by counseling 
inmates two days a week in the maximum-security section of nearby Trenton State 
Prison. 
</P>
<P>
And there, in 1980, McCloskey, naive in the ways of the criminal justice 
system, met George "Chiefie" De Los Santos, an illiterate junkie from the 
streets of Newark, who put him on his present path. 
</P>
<P>
Chiefie -- the name tattooed across his chest -- was in the sixth year of a 
life sentence for the murder of a Newark used-car salesman. He admitted to 
having earned heroin making deliveries for small-time dealers. But he claimed 
to be innocent of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
After hours of conversation over a period of weeks, McCloskey agreed to review 
the transcript of Chiefie's trial. There it was, in black and white: Chiefie 
had confessed. He had admitted the murder to Richard Delli Santi, another petty 
criminal in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Chiefie had played him for a fool. "It really shook me," McCloskey recalls. He 
confronted Chiefie. But Chiefie's explanation was simple: Delli Santi had made 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
"Why would anybody do that to you?" McCloskey demanded. "Why would Delli Santi 
lie?" 
</P>
<P>
"Well," Chiefie said, "he was in trouble with the law." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey thought that was pretty lame. But "I'd never been associated with the 
low lifes of the world," he says. "I'd never thought about police pressure." 
</P>
<P>
Chiefie explained to him, and McCloskey came away convinced. He offered to take 
a year off from the seminary to investigate Chiefie's claims. "That was my 
Christmas gift to him," McCloskey says. "I was moved by his plight. So it 
seemed to me I couldn't just offer up prayers for him and move on." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, McCloskey was tired of school. Living on his savings, he moved out of 
the dormitory and into the home of an elderly woman who allowed him to live 
rent free in exchange for doing her weekly shopping. Then he began his probe. 
</P>
<P>
Delli Santi turned out to be a longtime jailhouse informant who repeatedly 
claimed that cellmates confessed serious crimes to him. Despite 40 arrests as a 
junkie and burglar, Delli Santi had managed to avoid being sent to state prison 
by trading the supposed confessions to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey persuaded a smart and cynical Hoboken defense attorney, Paul 
Casteleiro, to help him win Chiefie's freedom. Together, they convinced a 
federal judge that Delli Santi had "contrived the alleged confession." 
</P>
<P>
What's more, U.S. District Court Judge Frederick B. Lacey said, the prosecution 
had known it and had suppressed evidence of perjury: Delli Santi had sworn that 
he had never before testified about confessions he'd supposedly heard in jail. 
"It is a virtual certainty that there would have been an acquittal if the jury 
had had all the evidence," the judge concluded. 
</P>
<P>
It took McCloskey 2 1/2 years to free Chiefie. By then, McCloskey had given up 
his original plan to become a conventional church pastor. "I now know that I 
could never do that work," he says, "because you get sucked up into all this 
petty administrative handholding stuff that doesn't mean a hill of beans." 
</P>
<P>
He had returned to the seminary and written his senior thesis on what he called 
"radical disciples" -- men who challenged society's ways and obeyed Christ's 
teachings at great worldly cost. They were: civil-rights leader Martin Luther 
King Jr.; George Fox, a 17th-Century Englishman who was jailed for founding the 
Society of Friends; George Whitefield, an 18th-Century evangelist who died from 
exhaustion, and Toyohiko Kagawa, a 20th-Century Japanese labor activist 
repeatedly jailed for pacifist teachings. 
</P>
<P>
These men, McCloskey wrote, "separated themselves from one life and blindly 
began another at the beckoning of Christ. Their work was both risky and 
revolutionary. Their personal inner knowledge of God and His Truth led them to 
challenge existing unjust structures, orders and systems. It led them to 
witness against and try to amend, reform, or eradicate terrible injustices. And 
in the end, except for God, their journey and work of discipleship was lonely. 
They were solitary and almost forlorn figures in trying to live out their 
faith." 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey clearly saw himself as one of them. He incorporated his ministry as a 
nonprofit organization and went to work on the cases of two other convicts he 
had met through Chiefie. He had a three-year dry spell before his next client 
was freed. Wrongly convicted murderer Rene Santana walked out of a New Jersey 
prison in 1986, when McCloskey proved that the state's star witness, motivated 
by a secret deal with prosecutors to have charges against him dropped, had 
lied. 
</P>
<P>
That year, McCloskey won freedom for Nathaniel Walker, an Elizabeth, N.J., man 
who also spent a decade behind bars for a rape he did not commit. The case 
rested on the blessed simplicity of physical evidence. McCloskey persuaded 
authorities to search for a vaginal swab that he knew had been taken but never 
tested. It turned up in a test tube, in a yellowed envelope, on a police 
property room shelf. FBI tests showed conclusively that Walker and the rapist 
had different blood types. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey's victory in the Walker case led to a burst of publicity. McCloskey, 
who had exhausted his own funds, had been getting contributions from friends 
and from the missionary fund of the church he had attended when he joined the 
seminary. But with the publicity came contributions from foundations and 
wealthy individuals, as well as an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
Kate Hill, a born-again Christian who had operated restaurants, bars, inns, a 
soup kitchen, boutique and shoe store, was looking for work when she read 
articles about McCloskey who, in published photographs, had "piles of stuff 
around him." "I thought, 'I could organize this guy,' " she says. She began 
commuting by train from New York to Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, McCloskey and Hill moved into their present office, across the 
street from the university, which a former Yugoslav prisoner of Tito rents to 
them at a below-market rate. The office consists of three rooms. There is a 
small storage area with boxes of letters from convicts labeled "no's and nuts." 
There is a much larger outer office, occupied by Hill and some volunteers, who 
mainly handle correspondence from inmates wanting help. And there is 
McCloskey's inner sanctum. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey lives monkishly, on about $22,000 a year, on the outskirts of 
Princeton. Far removed from the town's precious shops, his home is a studio 
apartment; the only decoration is a crucifix. But his office is cheery and 
shows a taste for the bizarre. Across from his desk is an oil painting given to 
him by Percy Foreman, the legendary Texas criminal defense lawyer. The painting 
is of a beautiful young woman posed seductively in the nude, a Foreman client 
who was accused of shooting her husband. There is a hole in the canvas -- the 
fatal bullet must have passed through her image before it entered him. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey is overwhelmed with requests for help. He received 160 in the first 
quarter of this year alone. Initially, inmates who write receive a form letter 
in which he apologizes and says that there is only a remote chance he will take 
their case. A grease pencil board on the wall shows how slim the odds really 
are. It lists active cases. There are only six. 
</P>
<P>
CHANCE MADE THE LIST in large part on the strength of his claim that he was in 
jail when the crime occurred. "That got my attention big-time," McCloskey says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the jail claim remains unproven, McCloskey is convinced that Chance 
and his friend, Benny Powell, are innocent of the crime for which they were 
sentenced to life in prison: the murder of off-duty Los Angeles County Deputy 
Sheriff David Andrews, 24. 
</P>
<P>
All that was known was that on Dec. 12, 1973, Andrews, dressed in civilian 
clothes, pulled into a service station at Normandie Avenue and Exposition 
Boulevard, parked his car at a phone booth, called someone, then went to the 
restroom. Two men entered behind him. Shots rang out. The men fled. Andrews was 
shot numerous times, and his gun was missing. 
</P>
<P>
Police canvassed the neighborhood. Their best witness was an 11-year-old girl 
who said she had been riding her bicycle and had seen the two men enter and 
flee. Her descriptions did not fit Chance, whom she knew from the neighborhood, 
or Powell. She said one of the men had pimples and wore a Godfather-style hat. 
The other was short and wore a gold earring. 
</P>
<P>
Moving methodically, detectives compiled lists of pimpled criminals, criminals 
who wore earrings and criminals who matched other facets of her descriptions. 
There was a lot of pressure to solve the case. Andrews had three brothers in 
local law enforcement, and, an investigator said, they wanted results. Police 
organizations offered thousands of dollars in rewards. But the police 
detectives assigned to the case were getting nowhere. They were removed, and a 
new team was instructed to work on the case full time until it was solved. 
</P>
<P>
For reasons now lost to time, the new detectives decided that the answer to the 
crime was on 38th Street, where Chance lived, a block away from the station. 
Powell also sometimes lived on 38th Street, where he was known as a 
troublemaker. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps unwittingly, the investigators then constructed what McCloskey contends 
was a "classic frame." 
</P>
<P>
They began with Powell. His name had already come up in the investigation. It 
appeared on a list of miscellaneous suspects compiled by the first set of 
detectives. And Powell hung around with Chance. Again and again, police visited 
the girl who had been riding her bicycle around the service station. 
</P>
<P>
Could she recognize photos of Powell or Chance? No, she said, she could not. 
They took her to a lineup in which they had placed Chance. She said he was not 
the man. But the police kept coming, and finally she changed her mind. 
</P>
<P>
McCloskey argues she succumbed to police pressure. Detective William Hall, a 
member of the team of new detectives, who now investigates officer-involved 
shootings, says the girl changed her mind on her own. He says she had not 
identified Chance at first because she had been afraid and that she finally 
decided to identify him because the Chance family house had burned down and the 
family had moved. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the truth, it is clear that shortly after the girl identified a 
photograph of Chance, police developed their best information on Powell. It 
came from another suspect in the case, Wayne Henderson, who now says he 
implicated Powell to divert attention from himself. 
</P>
<P>
"I said things about (Powell) to throw the cops off me," Henderson told 
McCloskey. "I never thought (Powell) did it." Henderson led police to a woman 
who he knew "was a liar who would do anything for money and really wanted that 
reward." 
</P>
<P>
She told police that Powell -- whom she had known as a child but had not seen 
for many years -- suddenly showed up at her house two weeks after the murder, 
told her he'd killed a man, needed to leave town and offered to sell her a gun. 
</P>
<P>
Then she apparently put police in touch with two teen-age girls who sometimes 
stayed at her house and who provided most of the rest of the police case. One 
of them, 16-year old Bernadine Kelly, was confined to a juvenile hall for a 
robbery when she was interviewed by the police. She told police that Powell had 
casually confessed to her. 
</P>
<P>
Tammy Jackson, 14, was on probation for the same robbery. After repeated visits 
from police and prompting from Henderson, who was acting at the behest of 
police, she said that, in a separate incident, Chance and Powell had confessed 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
Based on the teen-agers' assertions -- which they have told McCloskey they made 
up -- in 1974, police arrested Powell, who had moved to Kansas City, and then 
Chance. 
</P>
<P>
The 11-year-old eyewitness was taken to her second lineup. She testified that 
police showed her pictures of Chance on the way to the lineup and suggested 
that they wanted her to identify the same man whose photo she had belatedly 
picked. She did. 
</P>
<P>
But she said she still couldn't identify Powell. Then, suddenly a week before 
trial, Larry Wilson, a notorious jailhouse informant, claimed that Powell had 
proclaimed news of his guilt from the tier where he was housed in the county 
jail. Chance and Powell say they can't understand how a jury could have bought 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"Put this on record," Chance says from Folsom Prison, "I would have preferred 
to have been judged by a computer." 
</P>
<P>
But the jury did buy it, and persuading a court to overturn a jury conviction 
is tough. McCloskey has secured volunteer lawyers for Chance and Powell, and 
they expect to begin the slow process of petitioning courts for their release 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, McCloskey keeps talking to witnesses. Kelly, now a grown woman, says 
she lied "because the police, they kept on asking me all kinds of questions and 
like they was putting words in my head and so, I just went along with them and 
kind of made up stuff in my head." 
</P>
<P>
Jackson says she lied because the police had threatened to take her away from 
her grandmother unless she told them what they wanted to hear. She says she 
made up three stories until she finally found one that satisfied them. "I just 
said anything," she told McCloskey. "I wanted them to get out of my hair." 
</P>
<P>
To McCloskey this is a familiar refrain. Half of his cases have involved 
alleged confessions, ones that, as it turned out, never took place. For a long 
while, he couldn't understand how a human being could lie about someone 
confessing to murder. Then two recanting witnesses in two different cases 
explained it to him. 
</P>
<P>
" 'It's a matter of survival,' " he quotes them as saying. " 'Either I go away 
or your guy goes away. And I ain't going away.' "

RAMS FIND MEANING IN TODAY'S GAME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THEY NEED TO SWEEP THEIR LAST TWO GAMES TO AVOID FINISHING WITH 
THE WORST RECORD IN ROBINSON'S CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Eliminated, overestimated and currently embroiled in a public discussion over 
whose job should be terminated, the Rams will start trying Sunday to escape 
1990 without further embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
Playing for pride -- and possibly to give Coach John Robinson a dignified 
send-off after eight seasons at the helm -- the 5-9 Rams must sweep their final 
two games -- beginning Sunday against the 3-11 Falcons in Atlanta -- to avoid 
finishing with the worst record in Robinson's career. 
</P>
<P>
Given the wide understanding that these may be the final weeks of Robinson's 
Ram tenure, either by his choice or by Ram management's, does finishing proudly 
mean anything more to Robinson than it otherwise might? 
</P>
<P>
"It's important for us to go out with the best feeling we can, nothing to do 
with the first part one way or the other," said Robinson, who has dropped hints 
about the possibility of leaving but won't talk directly about it. 
</P>
<P>
"You want to play good. You don't want to do it for some other reason. There's 
plenty of reasons, just the fact that you're on a team together, that you spend 
seven months trying to reach a level of excellence. Those are plenty of 
reasons." 
</P>
<P>
After the season, Robinson has said, he and Executive Vice President John Shaw 
will decide whether he should return and, if he does, how the organization 
might be revised to better avoid 1990-type disasters. Robinson apparently wants 
more say-so in personnel matters and a pledge that the Rams will spend more 
money in the free-agent markets. 
</P>
<P>
But Robinson says that despite his situation, his players should be willing to 
avoid the natural letdown of playoff elimination by remembering their own 
dignity. 
</P>
<P>
That, he says, is how you get through meaningless games on the weekend before 
Christmas against 3-11 football teams. And if the Rams get through Sunday, all 
they have left is the last game on the NFL regular-season schedule, New Year's 
Eve in New Orleans against the barely-alive Saints. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we're all disappointed that we're out of it," Robinson said. "(But) I 
think the players have a sense of responsibility to themselves and to each 
other to try to play well and try to stick together, not become disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you have a professional pride that you're going to try to do the best 
you can. I think there's a commitment a person makes to his team when the team 
starts each year that, 'Hey, we're going to do the best we can this year.' I 
don't think anybody ever says, 'We're doing the best we can until we find that 
it isn't going to work, then we're going to quit.' " 
</P>
<P>
Robinson added: "I hope we're focused and concentrating on what to do. (But) 
we're obviously not going to play with the kind of emotion that you play with 
against the 49ers." 
</P>
<P>
Way back in the sixth week of the season, the Rams beat the Falcons, 44-24, in 
Anaheim Stadium, pulling themselves up to 2-4. Afterward, Robinson and a host 
of his players declared the team right back in the thick of things. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons have won one game since, the Rams three. And Fulton-County Stadium 
is going to be full of players who have every reason to be slightly less than 
emotionally-crazed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Falcons will probably start their third-string quarterback, Hugh Millen, 
because of injuries to their first two quarterbacks. Robinson has plans to play 
several of his younger second-string players. 
</P>
<P>
Said veteran right tackle Jackie Slater: "I look at these last two games as an 
opportunity for us to try to prove that we're a championship-type football team 
in our hearts, although things haven't worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the outcome of these games, I'm going to be looking at myself 
and I'm going to be looking at the guys I'm playing with, looking at their 
effort and looking at their desire to win the football game and compete every 
down. 
</P>
<P>
"More than anything else, we've just got to live with ourselves and our 
efforts. And I think if we have the right kind of efforts then we'll have the 
right kind of outcome -- that's a victory." 
</P>
<P>
And Slater said he does not believe that any change of the coaching staff is in 
order, whether or not the team wins its last two games. 
</P>
<P>
"You have a tendency not to look so hard at the dismal season that we've had, I 
guess," Slater said. "But we have a good coaching staff, and I think we have a 
nucleus of guys right here on this football team to return to the 
championship-caliber team we think we are." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
What has happened to the Atlanta Falcon team that seemed so promising in the 
exhibition season and through the first few weeks of the regular season? 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately I guess we've had about seven or eight games where we've gone 
right down to the final series where we've got a chance to either win it or 
lose it, and we haven't gotten the job done," Coach Jerry Glanville said. "I 
can't tell you how many games we've lost with a minute left in the game, where 
we had the chance to win the game with a minute, and we just haven't been able 
to get that final push and get it taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
Glanville, who went the final three years of his Houston Oiler tenure by taking 
the team to the playoffs, says he has been affected by his new team's losses. 
</P>
<P>
"A piece of you dies every week inside of you and it's been tough on 
everybody," he said. "I still think we'll be a very good football team, I think 
we've got some real good players. All that doesn't matter until you go get it 
done. We haven't been through one of these in a while and it's not easy on 
anybody."

MIKE DOWNEY: TIGER FANS GET EARLY LUMP OF COAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

<TEXT>
<P>
Ernie Harwell's eye doctor saw red. He called from an infirmary in Boston, just 
to let me know that his patient can definitely call 'em the way he sees 'em -- 
and more significantly, still see 'em the way he calls 'em -- because "Ernie 
still has the vision of a 30-year-old man." 
</P>
<P>
This was just before the doctor rattled off a letter to Ronald Reagan, former 
President of the United States, to ask his intervention in the Detroit Tigers' 
out-to-pasturing of Hall of Fame baseball announcer Ernie Harwell, a month 
before his 73rd birthday. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. President, I'm sure that you're sympathetic with Ernie's situation on 
several counts," wrote Dr. Carmen A. Puliafito, associate professor of 
ophthalmology, Harvard Medical School. "First of all, you, too, were a baseball 
broadcaster. Secondly, you showed the world that age was no impediment to 
vigorous leadership." 
</P>
<P>
The good doctor remembered that Reagan once invited Harwell into the Oval 
Office for 10 or 15 minutes, just to swap baseball war stories. He suggested 
that the President give Ernie a ring in time for Christmas -- and, oh, yeah: 
"You might also give Bo Schembechler, president of the Tigers, a call as well." 
</P>
<P>
Bet he gets a busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit baseball lovers are beside themselves with righteous indignation at the 
news, revealed Wednesday by Harwell, that he has been asked to step aside after 
the 1991 season, after 31 years as the warm and reassuring voice of the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
A kid named Vin Scully replaced Harwell as announcer for the Brooklyn Dodgers 
in 1950 when Harwell switched to the New York Giants. Harwell later did the 
Baltimore Orioles' play-by-play when the franchise was born in 1954, and has 
been with Detroit since 1960. In 43 years behind mikes, Harwell has missed two 
games, on neither occasion because of illness. 
</P>
<P>
To those of us lucky enough to know him, Ernie Harwell is a kindly country 
doctor pulling up in a horse-drawn buggy. His homespun descriptions of Tiger 
baseball waft through a room like a cool breeze, barely disturbing the drapes. 
A perfect gentleman? A lovely man? Ernie Harwell is Mother Teresa's computer 
date. 
</P>
<P>
Among the thousands of cries of protest came one from the owner of the nation's 
single-largest Domino's pizza franchise, who threatened to pull all advertising 
from Tiger radio broadcasts until the Harwell decision is reversed. This was in 
direct defiance of Tom Monaghan, founder and chairman of the Domino's pizza 
chain, who is the owner of the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
Domino's sales have dropped dramatically in the Detroit area since Harwell held 
a news conference to explain his enforced retirement. 
</P>
<P>
Hockey fans at Joe Louis Arena chanted, "We want Ernie! We want Ernie!" 
throughout that evening's game. Top-rated news anchorman Bill Bonds 
editorialized: "I have never heard such white-hot anger from so many people, 
from lawyers to hookers, from ex-cons to nuns." 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Tiger Stadium Fan Club, who already had been fighting on behalf 
of one sacred Detroit baseball relic, now are proposing a possible boycott of 
the 1991 home opener. A television poll lasting 7 1/2 hours drew more than 
10,000 callers, 97% wishing to say, "No to Bo." In Ann Arbor, a service 
station, Victory Lane Quick Oil Change, posted a billboard beside the highway: 
"Honk For Harwell!" Horns kept tooting for hours. 
</P>
<P>
There is a growing perception of Monaghan and Schembechler as a meddling Ann 
Arbor cabal, intent upon furthering their own interests at the expense of 
loyalty and tradition. First came word that Tiger management preferred to 
condemn Tiger Stadium and rebuild at a suburban locale, possibly Dearborn. 
Then, this. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, in the eyes of the outraged Dr. Puliafito, is now "the Grinch who 
stole Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Schembechler, remember, who, as athletic director of the 
University of Michigan, refused to permit Bill Frieder to coach in the 1989 
NCAA national basketball tournament because Frieder already had accepted 
another job, then allowed himself to coach Michigan in the Rose Bowl before 
leaving the university to become president of the Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same Schembechler who prides himself on loyalty, who banished 
Frieder because: "I want a Michigan man to coach Michigan." Yet it was Frieder, 
not Schembechler, who was an alumnus of Michigan, and Schembechler conveniently 
overlooked the fact that he left his own alma mater, Miami of Ohio, to coach 
somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
Harwell said he asked Schembechler to wait until after the 1991 season, then 
discuss retirement. He said he was asked to announce during next month's Tiger 
promotional tour that he was voluntarily stepping down. Calling a news 
conference to set the record straight, Harwell so moved those present that his 
longtime partner in the radio booth, Paul Carey, 63, said that he, too, would 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to work more years," Harwell said. "The station and the ballclub told 
me they didn't want me." 
</P>
<P>
At one juncture, Harwell mentioned a suggestion that his vision was not what it 
used to be. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why I'm calling," Dr. Puliafito said. "Just to personally let you know 
that not only does Ernie have the eyes of a 30-year-old man, but the enthusiasm 
of one, as well." 
</P>
<P>
Bumper stickers have cropped up all over Michigan reading: "Bo Doesn't Know 
Ernie." 
</P>
<P>
What Schembechler and Monaghan know about baseball, I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
But sometimes their minds have something in common with baseball. They're both 
filled with cork.

MORNING BRIEFING: SUPERSTITIOUS NFL PERSONNEL FIND REUBEN MEANS GOOD LUCK 
</P>

The National Livestock and Meat Board released the results of its survey of 
National Football League players and coaches. It came as no surprise that ham 
on wheat with American cheese, tomato and mayo was the favorite deli-meat 
sandwich, racking up a convincing 18% among those responding. 
</P>
<P>
Edelman Worldwide, the Chicago public relations firm handling the NLMB account, 
is to be commended for its tasteful handling of a delicate sub-topic. 
</P>
<P>
Said the firm's release: "The reuben sandwich made with corned beef was singled 
out as the 'good luck' sandwich by both an assistant coach for the Buffalo 
Bills and a halfback for the Los Angeles Rams." 
</P>
<P>
Both of whom presumably requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: Aside from having attended Brigham Young University, what do 
Philadelphia Eagle quarterback Jim McMahon and San Francisco 49er quarterback 
Steve Young have in common? 
</P>
<P>
Justification enough: Reporting the Golden State Warriors' recent victory at 
Orlando, Jeff Chapman of the Oakland Tribune wrote: "(Tim) Hardaway couldn't 
justify his poor shooting game. 'I was just missing,' he said." 
</P>
<P>
Man of marble: The "where they are now" section of Pro Legends, the official 
newsletter of the NFL Alumni, recently reported that a former Pittsburgh 
Steeler linebacker Tom Graves is the general manager of his family's business 
in Virginia Beach, Va. . . . Graves Funeral Home. 
</P>
<P>
No joking matter: Rich Cimini of Newsday reported recently that New York Jet 
Coach Bruce Coslet was excited about rookie quarterback Troy Taylor, who led a 
61-yard touchdown drive in the final minutes of last Sunday's 29-21 loss to the 
Indianapolis Colts. 
</P>
<P>
Coslet said he will start Ken O'Brien today against the New England Patriots. 
Cimini asked whether Taylor would play if the Jets open a big lead. 
</P>
<P>
Said Coslet: "I can't foresee us having a big lead. I'm not kidding, either." 
</P>
<P>
Downside of the coin: A recent Morning Briefing item took note of San Francisco 
running back Spencer Tillman's uncanny ability to win coin tosses by calling 
"Tails," as he did before the 49ers drove for the touchdown that beat 
Cincinnati in overtime on Dec. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Hammond of the NFL office points out that in the 10 overtime games 
played this season, the team that won the overtime coin toss won the game only 
three times. 
</P>
<P>
And the 49ers' victory over the Bengals was the only time a team began the 
overtime by driving for a score. 
</P>
<P>
Off probation: Since 1972, Charlie Baillie has built a record of 83-82 as 
football coach at McGill University in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
That's more victories than any coach in the school's 116-year history, so 
you've got to think the university is happy with Baillie's performance. 
</P>
<P>
Friday, Baillie signed a three-year contract, becoming McGill's first full-time 
coach since 1970. He's been part-time for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: Each has attempted and completed only one pass this season. 
</P>

Ryan's approach to his team's game with Dallas today: "Buddy doesn't have many

JOCKEY PAT VALENZUELA SUSPENDED SIX MONTHS; 
</P>
<P>
HORSE RACING: LEADING RIDER AT TWO RECENT MEETS IS PUNISHED BY THE HOLLYWOOD 
PARK BOARD OF STEWARDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jockey Pat Valenzuela, who hasn't ridden since Nov. 2 and who was suspended 
indefinitely Nov. 15, was set down for six months by the Hollywood Park Board 
of Stewards Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, 28, was punished for "repeated violations of California Horse 
Racing Board Rule 1872 (failure to fulfill jockey agreement) and for failure to 
honor the conditions and terms of probation in the rulings of April 17, 1988, 
and Oct. 27, 1989." 
</P>
<P>
The suspension was retroactive to Nov. 12, the day he was ordered to appear 
before the stewards after calling in sick Nov. 3 at Santa Anita -- and will be 
in effect through May 11, 1991. Valenzuela, the leading rider at Hollywood 
Park's summer meeting and at Del Mar, is also denied access to race tracks 
until Feb. 11. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after stewards Pete Pedersen, Tom Ward and David Samuel issued their 
ruling, Sam Silverstein, one of Valenzuela's two attorneys, filed an appeal 
with the CHRB. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm horrified," Silverstein said from his office Saturday. "It's the most 
punitive thing I've ever seen in racing. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole case was prejudged. We had no shot. It was a sham. Due process was 
not followed in this case. It's a foregone conclusion what the Board's going to 
say. The appeal's going to be denied." 
</P>
<P>
Silverstein is seeking an affidavit from Dr. Neil Fisher, who talked to 
Valenzuela Nov. 3, then issued a statement that was released by the stewards at 
Oak Tree. In the statement, Fisher said Valenzuela refused to submit to a drug 
test and was going to take three months off to straighten out his life. 
</P>
<P>
According to Silverstein, Valenzuela refused only to take the test at Fisher's 
office in Covina. "He was ill," Silverstein said. "He wasn't able to go 
anywhere. He was willing to take the test if somebody came to his house." 
</P>
<P>
The stewards received reports from three doctors -- orthopedic specialist 
Robert Kerlan and internists Jokichi Takamine and Albert Puskas -- who examined 
Valenzuela, but Silverstein said he wasn't allowed to see the reports before 
Friday's 90-minute hearing. 
</P>
<P>
The attorney, who is the father of jockey agent Rich Silverstein, said Puskas 
recommended no suspension for Valenzuela. Takamine suggested two weeks and 
Kerlan called for one year. 
</P>
<P>
Pedersen wasn't surprised by the decision to appeal. "We knew very likely we'd 
have to support our decision," he said. "The decision was strictly ours. We 
discussed it Friday and put out our ruling this morning. 
</P>
<P>
"To our understanding, Pat's done a good job with AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) 
meetings, and he's had an awful lot of counseling. Dr. Kerlan and the Jockeys' 
Guild and the industry would like a program that everybody can feel comfortable 
with and monitor." 
</P>
<P>
Valenzuela, who was suspended for 60 days late last year after testing positive 
for cocaine, was also placed on probation Saturday by the stewards until Dec. 
31, 1992. In April of 1988, Valenzuela was suspended for failure to appear.

A TAC panel hearing the appeal of shotputter Randy Barnes' drug suspension 
adjourned without reaching a finding. 
</P>
<P>
The panel, meeting in Washington, could not reach a decision because it was 
waiting for documents to review. A decision in the case is expected next week. 
Barnes, the world record-holder in the shotput, was suspended by the 
International Amateur Athletic Federation for two years on Nov. 6 after testing 
positive for an anabolic steroid at a meet in Sweden last August.

George Hicker, a Sherman Oaks businessman, disputed a Syracuse Post-Standard 
story that said he had hired former Laker LeRoy Ellis at the time Ellis' son 
LeRon decided to transfer from Kentucky to Syracuse, Hicker's alma mater. 
</P>
<P>
Ellis was hired through an employment agency in November 1988, said Hicker, 
though he could not go on the payroll of the Hicker Co., Inc., which does 
business as the Cardinal Co., until passing a state test to get his real estate 
license. 
</P>
<P>
This was completed on July 9, 1989, nine days after LeRon Ellis announced his 
transfer to Syracuse, Hicker said. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave it a year and it didn't work out," Hicker added, saying that LeRoy 
Ellis no longer is in his employ. 
</P>
<P>
Hicker, a teammate of Syracuse Coach Jim Boeheim during the 1960s, said that he 
has never recruited for his alma mater and that he had employed only one 
Syracuse player, Stephen Thompson, during summers while Thompson was in school.

The Boston Celtics said they have signed free agent Derek Smith, 29, an 
eight-year NBA veteran recovering from knee surgery. Smith has averaged nearly 
13 points a game in his career, including three seasons with the Clippers in 
San Diego and Los Angeles.

FAST START BY CELTICS' VETERANS SHOWS THEY'RE NOT ON LAST LEGS

Robert Parish of the Boston Celtics says he enjoys the challenge of playing 
against younger men. 
</P>
<P>
Because he's 37, that's every center in the league. 
</P>
<P>
With Larry Bird and Kevin McHale, 34 and 33 respectively, that's a 104-year-old 
front line, but the Celtics are thriving at a fat 21-4. 
</P>
<P>
Their season started, shall we say, inauspiciously? Brian Shaw sued the team to 
try to remain in Italy. Dave Gavitt, hired to succeed Red Auerbach, wooed 
Duke's Mike Krzyzewski but failed. 
</P>
<P>
Gavitt was left to promote assistant Chris Ford to coach. Ford said he wanted 
to go back to fast-breaking to take advantage of the young legs of the 
since-reconciled Shaw, Reggie Lewis and rookie Dee Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Bird, not as keen on running as he was when he could, said he would believe it 
when he saw it. 
</P>
<P>
To which McHale, always a natural rival, responded: 
</P>
<P>
"It takes five guys to run. If four guys run, the fifth guy is just a free 
safety out there. If everyone's not doing what's best for the team, we might as 
well pack it up and go home." 
</P>
<P>
The season before, Bird had sniffed publicly about soon-to-be-outgoing coach 
Jimmy Rodgers. This time, Ford gathered the team together the next day, read 
the Bird quotes out of the newspaper and called Bird down in front of everyone. 
</P>
<P>
Bird immediately came to grips with the new regime. He's been cheery and 
productive, if not on his pre-heel surgery level. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not close to being the way I used to be," he told the Boston Globe's 
Jackie MacMullan. "My confidence just isn't where it once was, and it probably 
never will be again. I thought last year I'd get it all back, but it never 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
In last week's showdown against the Philadelphia 76ers, Bird had 24 points, 
seven rebounds, eight assists and six steals. He's close enough to what he was, 
as are the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Frisky: The night after the Celtics beat the Detroit Pistons in Boston, Parish 
had 23 points and 13 rebounds in 27 minutes at Miami against 25-year-old Rony 
Seikaly of the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
Search for Showtime: Why don't the Lakers run the way they used to? 
</P>
<P>
Mike Dunleavy says it's not by design. Several factors enter in: 
</P>
<P>
 -- It didn't start this season. The Lakers ran less in recent years and won 
more by defense. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Lakers lead the league in defensive rebounding by keeping their guards 
in. Magic Johnson and Byron Scott average 11.3 rebounds a game. Maybe they have 
improved enough to sneak Byron back out on the break? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Johnson and James Worthy are playing so many minutes -- 39.2 a game each, 
second in the league to Pooh Richardson's 41.9 -- that they have to pay for it 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They haven't made it the first priority in practice. Dunleavy says he's cut 
back on the running drills to rest his players between games. 
</P>
<P>
One thing that is not happening is players grumbling about it, causing unrest 
of the type that led to the firing of Paul Westhead. Everyone seems to realize 
they are in a period of adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
But they could use the easy hoops. 
</P>
<P>
Pigeons: Are the Lovabulls the Chicago Bulls' cheerleaders or the Pistons' name 
for the Bulls themselves? 
</P>
<P>
When Detroit's skid reached 1-7, Chuck Daly said: "Right now, we'll take a win 
over anybody, even a high school team." 
</P>
<P>
Providentially, the next opponent due into the Palace was Chicago, which fell, 
105-84. 
</P>
<P>
As usual, all the Bulls but Michael Jordan wilted. Jordan had 33 points. No 
other Bull scored in double figures. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan had 13 baskets. The other 11 Bulls combined for 22. Said Jordan: 
"They're just better than we are." 
</P>
<P>
Over four seasons, including playoffs, the Bulls are 9-28 against the Pistons, 
2-14 at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that Dennis Rodman simply owns Scottie Pippen, who is supposed to 
be the Bulls' No. 2 scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
The teams will meet again Tuesday in Chicago. Says Bull Coach Phil Jackson: "If 
we don't do any better, we'll take a look at who we've got out there." 
</P>
<P>
NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento General Manager Jerry Reynolds, who traded Danny Ainge for Byron 
Irvin, whom he traded, too: "I always said my goal is to build a championship 
team. Unfortunately, it's in Portland." . . . Nice scouting report: With 
Houston in town, Charlotte Coach Gene Littles said Akeem Olajuwon isn't 
surrounded by the same quality players as Pat Ewing and David Robinson, and 
called Kenny Smith and Sleepy Floyd "journeymen." Outraged, the Rockets beat 
the Hornets, barely. Said Rocket Coach Don Chaney: "I guess it shows the kind 
of respect people have for us around the league." 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' Ralph Sampson isn't playing and is resisting management suggestions 
that he become an assistant coach or retire or just go away. He did get into a 
fight at practice with Bill Wennington. "Ralph elbowed me in the face," 
Wennington said. "I'm not here for that, contrary to popular belief." . . . 
Michael Jordan, after the Bulls took a 36-5 first-quarter lead over the 
Cleveland Cavaliers: "They looked like chickens with their heads cut off." 
</P>
<P>
Sacramento's Wayman Tisdale, after making 10 consecutive shots against the 
Orlando Magic: "The basket looked as wide as my rear end." . . . Said Coach 
Cotton Fitzsimmons of Phoenix's 6-1 record since Xavier McDaniel reported: "The 
funny thing is that we're not playing all that well. When we do start to play 
Suns basketball, there'll be very few teams that can stay with us." . . . 
Reality asserts itself again: The four expansion teams started the weekend with 
an aggregate 28-game losing streak.

ADOPT-A-FAMILY PROGRAM DELIVERS HOLIDAY JOY; 
</P>

GIVING: HARBOR REGIONAL CENTER FINDS SPONSORS FOR 250 FAMILIES WHO HAVE 
DISABLED LOVED ONES AND PRESSING FINANCIAL NEEDS.

It's two days until Christmas and 11-year-old Bambi Thomas already has a bike 
and a Barbie doll. Her brother, Pierre, has a silver scooter. And cousin 
Tyrell, well, he just keeps smiling about all the presents he got this year: 
the roller skates, a radio, red tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrell, an autistic 13-year-old, is the reason this year's holidays include 
dozens of gifts for him and his family from people they barely know. The gifts 
fill the family's two-bedroom apartment at Dana Strand Village in Wilmington. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so wonderful," Tyrell's grandmother, Vivian Jackson, says, watching her 
grandchildren play with their toys. "It's a blessing, it really is," adds her 
daughter Shirley, Tyrell's mother. 
</P>
<P>
The toys were among the presents given to the family last week by Los Angeles 
Harbor College -- one of more than 100 sponsors of a special holiday program 
providing gifts, food, clothing and even small checks to South Bay families 
with developmentally disabled parents or children. 
</P>
<P>
The Adopt-A-Family program is sponsored by Harbor Regional Center, a 
state-funded, nonprofit agency in Torrance that serves about 5,000 
developmentally disabled people in the area. The center, founded in 1977, 
provides counseling, referral and other services to people disabled by autism, 
mental retardation, cerebral palsy, severe epilepsy or other neurological 
disorders. The clients range in age from infants to senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The center's program began in late 1986 when the Soroptimists of Del 
Amo/Torrance contacted Harbor Regional about sponsoring one of the center's 
families for the holidays, said John Kauffman, the center's outreach 
coordinator. "They said they'd like to do something at Christmas as a project," 
Kauffman said. "And the program just grew from there." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the program will serve its largest number ever -- 250 families 
selected by the center's counselors. The families, Kauffman said, not only have 
disabled parents or children but pressing financial problems. "They are the 
very neediest of the people we serve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chris' family is an example. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Artesia teen-ager was nearly killed in a gang attack near his 
home, run down by a pickup truck as he rode his bicycle with a friend. Chris, 
14, suffered profound brain damage in the attack, which was aimed at his 
friend, who belonged to a gang. 
</P>
<P>
"One day, he's a normal kid and the next day, he's in a hospital almost dead," 
said Chris' mother Eva, a single mother of four who asked that her family's 
last name not be used because her son's attackers remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
The incident left Chris unable to walk or talk. It also devastated his family, 
financially and emotionally. 
</P>
<P>
Eight months after the attack, as the family struggled with the new and 
staggering responsibilities of caring for Chris, Harbor Regional's Kauffman 
went to their home. He brought with him food, a check for $100 and Christmas 
gifts including a radio for Chris, who has always loved music. 
</P>
<P>
Brenda Smiley, a Harbor Regional counselor, recalled, "After they got the 
presents, Eva called me up and said, 'You know, I was really starting to give 
up. I felt like we were headed down a long, dark hole. But when the gifts came, 
I realized it was a tunnel because there was light at the other end.' " 
</P>
<P>
"What really made my heart drop was the check," Eva added in an interview. "I 
just couldn't believe it. I didn't know there were people like that out there. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a load on my shoulders, but I'm strong enough for that. Sympathy, I 
don't need," she said. "But the help they gave me was fantastic." 
</P>
<P>
The program, according to Harbor Regional officials, not only helps the 
families through the holidays but serves as an unexpected acknowledgement of 
what they endure in caring for a disabled relative. 
</P>
<P>
"Having a developmentally disabled person in a family is very disruptive. The 
person requires a lot of attention," Kauffman said. "And this is a time when 
that is acknowledged by others. Suddenly, this person who you've been caring 
for all year is bringing something to the family." 
</P>
<P>
The program, center officials said, also provides the disabled with new 
self-esteem. "One of the ways to stimulate the return of anybody's functions is 
to build significant events into their life," Smiley said. "So this program 
really seems to improve the client's self-image, because they understand that 
people really do care, that people want them to have a nice holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"And that helps to strengthen the relationships within the family. Life gets 
happier for everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Chris' case, the gifts -- particularly the portable radio -- were catalysts 
in overcoming severe depression that followed him home from the hospital last 
year, Smiley said. 
</P>
<P>
"He went through some serious depression, of course, as he was beginning to 
recuperate," she said. "Now he's got his smile back. And that's good." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, according to Smiley and others, the program helps bring the travails 
of the developmentally disabled to the attention of other families, family 
sponsors and service groups. "It gives people some idea of what it's like, and 
they see the similarities between themselves and the disabled are more striking 
than the differences," Kauffman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every kid likes to celebrate Christmas or Hanukkah," he said. "Everyone likes 
to have clothes to wear and food to eat."

TORRANCE, SISTER CITY TRY TO CALM TEAHOUSE TEMPEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The planned Japanese garden in Torrance, the centerpiece of a new city cultural 
arts center, is supposed to be an idyllic place, with several patios, plants, a 
fountain, a pond and water tumbling over rocks. 
</P>
<P>
But even before the first stone has been set in place, the garden's serene tone 
has been disturbed by controversy. 
</P>
<P>
The tempest is over a teahouse. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand is Epson America Inc., the Torrance-based affiliate of Seiko 
Epson Corp. of Japan, which is building the garden at a cost of about $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
On the other is Torrance's sister city, Kashiwa, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Kashiwa has offered Torrance the gift of a teahouse for the garden. 
</P>
<P>
But it is not the kind of teahouse envisioned by the Epson architect who 
designed the garden. 
</P>
<P>
In the middle are city officials, who don't want to upset either party. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in a situation where two fine friends of the city are being hurt," Mayor 
Katy Geissert said Thursday in a tone of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager LeRoy J. Jackson said: "What we're trying to do now is coordinate 
all these efforts so we can end up with a teahouse and a garden -- so that 
everyone will come away happy." 
</P>
<P>
The teahouse that Kashiwa wants to give Torrance is called a chashitsu, and 
would cost between $70,000 and $80,000. It is a formal closed structure, 
traditionally used for tea ceremonies, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Architects of the 10,000-square-foot garden prefer a more open structure called 
an azumaya, city officials said. The garden itself will be confined by 
buildings on all sides, and an open-sided structure has been judged more 
compatible, Geissert said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Epson says the decision is up to the city, its architect has judged 
that an open-sided structure is more compatible. A city landscape architect 
agrees. 
</P>
<P>
The city's predicament arises from poor communication, several city officials 
say. Some blame the fact that the Torrance Sister City Assn. -- not City Hall 
-- was corresponding with Kashiwa until recently. 
</P>
<P>
City Councilman George Nakano, who helped initiate plans for the Epson garden, 
said a lack of direct communication between the city manager's office and 
Kashiwa officials has been a major problem. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, the city needs to establish direct communication," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are also concerned about the origin of the teahouse gift. 
</P>
<P>
The city never asked for it, Geissert and others said. 
</P>
<P>
The request seems to have originated with a member of the Torrance Sister City 
Assn., a private group that works to maintain relations between Torrance and 
Kashiwa. 
</P>
<P>
Mikko Haggott-Henson, the association's president since June, said Friday that 
in December, 1989, she sent Kashiwa officials a newspaper article about the 
Japanese garden. 
</P>
<P>
Haggott-Henson said she suggested to Kashiwa officials that "it would be nice 
to have a teahouse." 
</P>
<P>
Kashiwa had already offered 200 cherry trees to the city, but that gift was 
ruled out because of state agricultural restrictions, Haggott-Henson said. She 
said she suggested the teahouse to Kashiwa officials as an alternative. 
</P>
<P>
Then, last January, the Kashiwa Sister City Committee approved the gift of a 
teahouse to Torrance to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the sister-city 
relationship, Haggott-Henson said. 
</P>
<P>
She said she thought the teahouse had Torrance's blessing because of her 
discussions with Phil Tilden, capital projects administrator for the city, and 
with Nakano, who she thought was informing Epson of the plans. But Nakano said 
Friday that he had no authority to authorize acceptance of the gift. 
</P>
<P>
The Kashiwa Sister City Committee asked for a letter from Torrance requesting 
the teahouse, so that a delegation of Kashiwa visitors could announce the gift 
in Torrance last February, Haggott-Henson said. She said she asked Geissert for 
the letter, but Geissert refused. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't ask for gifts. That's not our custom," Geissert said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Kashiwa committee asked instead for a letter from the president of the 
Torrance Sister City Assn. so that the announcement could be made, 
Haggott-Henson said. Because of time constraints, she said, she could not get 
the permission of then-President Irene Harter, so she wrote the letter herself, 
put Harter's name on it and tried to fax it to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Haggott-Henson said the letter never arrived, so the announcement was never 
made. 
</P>
<P>
Later she told Harter what she had done. "She didn't like it, of course," she 
said, "and I apologized." 
</P>
<P>
An Epson representative said Friday that the discussion of what type of 
teahouse belongs in the garden "is between Kashiwa and Torrance." 
Groundbreaking for the garden is planned for February, with completion by 
autumn, said the representative, Carolin A. Keith, manager of community 
relations for Epson America. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say they are now trying to deal directly with Kashiwa. A recent 
exchange of letters reveals that some differences in perception remain. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wrote Nov. 27 to the president of the Kashiwa Sister City Committee in 
Japan, expressing Torrance's gratitude for the teahouse offer and suggesting 
that Kashiwa officials talk directly to the architect for Epson. 
</P>
<P>
But a Kashiwa Sister City Committee official wrote Jackson on Dec. 12 that the 
architect had already faxed a note to Japan, saying "that azumaya (arbor) is a 
final decision, not chashitsu (teahouse)." 
</P>
<P>
"Frankly speaking, your letters have puzzled me," the Kashiwa committee 
official wrote. "We have been planning the teahouse gift project for almost a 
year, keeping in touch with the Torrance Sister City Assn. We believe that a 
teahouse is worth enough to be a symbol of the 20th year (of the cities' 
relationship)." The letter described the chashitsu as an example of typical 
Japanese cultural architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Jackson wrote back Dec. 14, saying the city had not been involved in the 
project until August. He suggested that "it would be most beneficial if the 
communications and discussions on this matter be directly between my office and 
you." He said he has not received a response. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an embarrassment," Geissert said, "because Epson has certainly made a 
very generous and very gracious gift to the city, and Kashiwa is apparently 
considering doing likewise."

<TEXT>
<P>
Puppets are coming to the Manhattan Village Shopping Center this afternoon to 
give children and their harried parents an entertaining respite from mall 
madness. 
</P>
<P>
Puppeteer Valerie Leonardi and her large cast of elves, assorted animals, an 
orphan boy and a kindly piano teacher will perform free musical shows at 1 and 
3 p.m. in the Center Court of the Manhattan Beach center, which is located at 
Sepulveda Boulevard and Rosecrans Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"Kids are so restless at this time. We want to give them a little diversion and 
make it easier for Mom and Dad," said Margo Heltzel, mall marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
Leonardi, a one-woman puppet show who operates all of the hand puppets and 
creates the various voices, said her shows make moral points as well as 
entertain. In "The Selfish Elf," one of Santa's helpers, who likes to keep 
children's presents for himself, learns that the true joy of Christmas is in 
giving. And in "Miss Julie's Christmas Surprise," a piano teacher adopts an 
orphan boy after realizing that he is the best present of all. Leonardi says: 
"I'm trying to put something (alongside) the materialism of buying presents." 
</P>
<P>
But her first aim is to capture children's imaginations, and she fills the 
shows with fast action. "It has to be fun. If it's not, the kids get up and 
walk away," she said. At the end of each show, she comes from behind the stage 
and talks to the children about puppetry "just to make sure the 3-year-olds 
don't think the wolf is under their beds or that puppets can move on their 
own." GERALD FARIS

CHILD'S REFERENCE LIBRARY IS A WISE INVESTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES: Mary Yarber teaches English and 
journalism at an area high school and writes an occasional education column for 
The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the best investments you can make to help your child excel in school is 
to build a current and thorough reference library at home. 
</P>
<P>
But spending hundreds of dollars on a set of encyclopedias is not necessary. In 
fact, many librarians advise spending the money on a set of more versatile 
books instead. 
</P>
<P>
A thorough and accurate dictionary is the most important reference book your 
child can possibly have while in school, and two publishers are favored by 
teachers and librarians. 
</P>
<P>
"Webster's Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary" offers almost 160,000 words with 
200,000 definitions. A new feature in this edition is that the entries are 
dated -- that is, your student can find the age of a word and when it was first 
used. 
</P>
<P>
Webster's costs $17.95 in hardcover. 
</P>
<P>
Also popular with teachers and students is the "American Heritage Second 
College Edition Dictionary," which also costs $17.95 in hardcover. It contains 
100,000 definitions, but its special feature is the 3,000 photographs and 
illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
A paperback American Heritage dictionary costs just $4.95, but is leaner, with 
60,000 definitions and 400 photographs. 
</P>
<P>
Next to a good dictionary, a thesaurus is most important because it helps 
writers avoid tiresome overuse of certain words by suggesting appropriate 
synonyms. 
</P>
<P>
According to many teachers and librarians, the name Roget is itself a synonym 
for "thesaurus," because "Roget's International Thesaurus" is the most 
definitive. This single volume contains 256,000 words and phrases and their 
synonyms, in alphabetical order. That's about 100,000 words and phrases more 
than other thesauruses have. 
</P>
<P>
In hardcover, the fourth edition of Roget's costs $15.95; the paperback is 
$10.95. 
</P>
<P>
If your student is in junior or senior high school, he or she is probably 
studying a foreign language. A dictionary for that language is indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
The Cassell's series of language dictionaries is favored by many teachers. 
Cassell's Spanish-English, French-English and German-English dictionaries each 
sell for $21.95 in hardback. 
</P>
<P>
They all include words most used in modern speech and literature, as well as 
idioms and newly accepted words. They also contain pronunciation guides and 
verb conjugation tables. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller editions are $10.95 each, and will fit easily into your child's 
backpack. 
</P>
<P>
The hottest new one-volume desk encyclopedia is the "Random House 
Encyclopedia." Its 2,912 pages include 13,500 illustrations and a 132-page 
full-color atlas. 
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia is divided into sections such as "The Universe," "Life on 
Earth," "History and Culture," and "Man and Science." Each of these contains 
dozens of subtopics. 
</P>
<P>
Random House prices its encyclopedia at $129.95, but at least one local 
bookstore chain is now selling it for about $65. 
</P>
<P>
The "1991 World Almanac and Book of Facts" has just hit the bookstores. This 
annual favorite comes in paperback and costs $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
The almanac is not only useful for finding statistics for reports and speeches, 
but is also intriguing because of its variety of topics. Headings include 
"All-Time Top 50 Movie Grosses," "Tips for Fuel-Efficient Driving," and "Major 
Decisions of the Supreme Court." 
</P>
<P>
All maps and flags of the world are new to this edition, and there are about 1 
million up-to-date facts in all. 
</P>
<P>
Recently I wrote about the declining fitness of area teen-agers and suggested 
that you help your child exercise more. Now you can buy a book that tells how 
to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
"Teenage Fitness," by Bonnie Prudden, sells for about $10 in paperback and 
outlines a complete exercise program for your teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
The book includes tests to spot the student's physical strengths and 
weaknesses, and offers dozens of exercises that do not require special clothing 
or equipment. It also advises students on how to make the most of his or her 
gym facilities at school. 
</P>
<P>
A handbook of etiquette may at first seem out of place in a student's reference 
library. But good manners and social poise are skills as necessary for success 
in life as reading and writing. 
</P>
<P>
Emily Post's "Etiquette," fourteenth edition, is probably the best up-to-date 
guide to modern manners for teens and adults. Post will help your child master 
the basic rules of social interaction, including table manners, making good 
conversation, writing business letters and other common courtesies. 
</P>
<P>
It is a valuable and timeless book, available in hardcover for $25.95.

MONEY TALK: SAVINGS BONDS VS. MUNI BONDS AS COLLEGE FUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Q: I have been buying U.S. Savings Bonds for the last three years for my 
child's college fund. I have never fully understood what happens after the 
bonds mature. If I keep the bonds for 16 years, until they are needed to pay 
for college, what will their value be? What about municipal bonds? Can I buy 
these through payroll deductions, as well? Which option would I have more luck 
with? -- P. C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Series EE Savings Bonds mature 12 years after being issued and, at that 
time, are worth -- at the very minimum -- the value printed on them. 
</P>
<P>
Why the uncertainty about their value? Because for the first five years after 
they are issued, the bonds pay an interest rate that is fixed at the time they 
are sold. After the first five years, however, the interest rate varies every 
six months -- according to the prevailing cost of money. 
</P>
<P>
If interest rates are rising, the U.S. government will adjust the rate upward; 
if rates are falling, so will that paid on the bonds. So, although you can 
never be sure exactly what the bonds will be worth when you redeem them, if you 
hold them until maturity, they will not be worth any less than their face 
value. 
</P>
<P>
Zero-coupon municipal bonds, which pay interest only at maturity, are entirely 
different. You are perhaps confused because in a recent Money Talk column, I 
compared the state of California's October sale of "college saver" state bonds 
to municipal bonds. The column noted that the state's bond issue, while in far 
smaller denominations to appeal to the small saver, was otherwise virtually 
identical to a zero-coupon municipal bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
Municipal bonds and state college saver bonds -- if they are ever issued again 
-- are available only through selected brokers and financial institutions. 
There are no payroll deduction plans for such purchases. 
</P>
<P>
Will you have more luck with EE Savings Bonds or municipal bonds? No one can 
say for sure. Each has pluses and minuses that you should consider carefully 
before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
For convenience and safety, you can't do better than U.S. Savings Bonds. 
However, if you want to maximize your investment and don't mind taking a little 
more risk and spending extra time and effort doing research, municipal bonds 
can be a good investment, especially if you hold them until maturity and select 
your investment carefully. 
</P>
<P>
California municipal bonds are double-tax-free: You pay neither state nor 
federal income tax on the interest they generate. Traditional U.S. Savings 
Bonds are still subject to federal tax. Although the U.S. government's new 
Series EE college savings bonds are tax-free, the tax exemption is gradually 
phased out for families with an annual adjusted gross income of $60,000 and up. 
</P>
<P>
Another point to consider is how you can use the bond proceeds when they 
mature. There are no restrictions with municipal bonds or college saver state 
bonds. However, proceeds from Series EE college savings bonds may be used only 
for college expenses.

By the way, zero-coupon municipal bonds or state bonds are best suited to 
portfolios of only those in the highest tax bracket -- since one of their major 
advantages is their tax-exempt status. Finally, don't buy them if you think you 
might have to sell them prematurely. The value of zero-coupon bonds can 
fluctuate wildly in the secondary market due to interest rate changes, so 
buyers should plan on holding them to maturity.

Parted Couple Can Share Home Tax Break 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband moved out of our house in 1987. There is no legal separation or 
divorce; he just lives elsewhere. What happens with the $125,000 profit 
exemption when the house is sold? -- M.T.B. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Assuming that at least one of you is over 55 and has lived in the house for 
three of the past five years -- and there is no divorce or legal separation 
decree -- our experts say you and your husband are entitled to share a single 
$125,000 exemption. 
</P>
<P>
If you were to divorce or file for a decree of separate maintenance, you could 
possibly qualify for two exemptions. However, the IRS could balk at your 
husband's qualifying for an exemption because he has not lived in the house for 
three of the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Wife's Earnings Won't Halt His Social Security 
</P>
<P>
Q: I plan to start receiving Social Security upon turning 62 in three years. My 
wife, who is four years younger than I, would continue working for a few more 
years after I retire. Will her income affect my benefits, especially the 
earning limits of $6,840 for Social Security recipients? -- F.E.C. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not at all. The income limits you mention apply only to the earnings of the 
Social Security recipient -- or any beneficiary also receiving payments on the 
primary recipient's account. Since you will be receiving payments from your own 
account, what your wife earns will not in any way affect the level of Social 
Security payments you are entitled to receive. Now, if you were to begin 
receiving spousal benefits from your wife's account before she stops working, 
then your benefits would be reduced, since the primary recipient is still a 
wage earner. 
</P>
<P>
By the way, you should know that although your Social Security benefits will 
not be reduced because your wife continues to work, they could be subject to 
taxation if your yearly household income -- including Social Security as well 
as unearned investment income -- exceeds $32,000 per year per couple or $25,000 
for an individual. Once you cross this threshold, you will be required to pay 
income tax on half your Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
Congress imposed this requirement as a way of recouping taxes on the one-half 
of your Social Security benefits that was contributed by your employer and 
never taxed. The tax applies only to those with household income in excess of 
$32,000 (couples) and $25,000 (individuals) in order not to hurt the less 
wealthy.

PERSONAL FINANCE: A LAST-MINUTE TAX SHELTER WORTH CONSIDERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL SING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's like an individual retirement account, but in some ways better. It's one 
of the few legitimate tax shelters left that you can still pursue this late in 
the year. And many people who are eligible to have one don't. 
</P>
<P>
It's a Keogh plan, and if you have self-employment income, you should consider 
opening one this week if you don't have one. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, anybody who has self-employment income should be looking at setting 
up a Keogh," says Edward Rosenson, a tax partner in charge of personal 
financial planning in the Los Angeles office of the accounting firm Ernst &amp; 
Young. But many people don't know about Keoghs because "the publicity by far is 
in favor of IRAs." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes called Super IRAs, Keoghs are tax-deferred retirement accounts that 
you can set up if you earn self-employment income such as from your own 
business, professional practice or from a small sideline activity or hobby. If 
you work for a big corporation by day but moonlight as a screenwriter, painter, 
carpenter or other self-employed worker, you can put the income from that 
self-employment into a Keogh. 
</P>
<P>
Keoghs have many of the advantages of IRAs. Contributions are tax-deductible. 
Earnings accumulate tax deferred until withdrawn, presumably when you retire. 
Assets can be invested in many of the same instruments allowed in IRAs, such as 
certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds and mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Like an IRA, you can set up a Keogh at a bank, brokerage house or mutual fund. 
You also can roll over lump-sum distributions from your pension plan, 401(k) 
company savings plan or other qualified retirement plan into your Keogh. 
</P>
<P>
But Keoghs have some advantages over IRAs. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* You can put more money into them. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the limits for annual contributions are far higher than the $2,000 
annual limit on IRA contributions. The exact amount depends on which type of 
Keogh you choose. 
</P>
<P>
In a "profit sharing" Keogh -- the most flexible type -- you can decide each 
year whether to contribute and how much, up to 15% of your net profit from your 
self-employment activity, to a maximum of $30,000. 
</P>
<P>
In a "money purchase" Keogh, you can contribute a fixed percentage of 
self-employment earnings each year, up to a maximum of 25%, or $30,000. But you 
must contribute this same amount every year, unless your business shows a loss. 
</P>
<P>
You can also choose a "paired" plan that has features of both profit sharing 
and money purchase plans. You choose the percentage that you contribute 
annually to the money purchase portion, and then you can contribute to the 
profit sharing portion. The total can go up to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
There also are "defined benefit" Keoghs in which you can contribute even more. 
You'll need a professional, such as an actuary or accountant, to tell you how 
much, according to Michael Shuler, a public affairs specialist with the 
Internal Revenue Service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
* You have more flexibility on when to contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Like an IRA, you must set up your Keogh by Dec. 31 of the year you will claim 
deductions for your contribution. But you can wait until you file -- April 15 
or even later if you get an extension -- before actually making the 
contribution deductible for the previous tax year. 
</P>
<P>
With an IRA, your deadline is April 15, regardless of whether you file for an 
extension. 
</P>
<P>
* You can save taxes upon withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Money you withdraw from an IRA after age 59 1/2 is generally taxed at your 
regular rate. But if you have contributed for at least five years to a Keogh, 
were at least 50 years old in 1986 and take your money out of your Keogh in a 
lump sum after age 59 1/2, you may be able to use a special five-year averaging 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In effect, this allows you to treat the account as if you withdrew the money in 
equal, smaller amounts stretched over five years. That's going to lower your 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
Because of these advantages, if you are leaving a company, consider rolling 
over your company pension or 401(k) money into a Keogh instead of an IRA. 
</P>
<P>
Another advantage to Keoghs: You can have one and still keep your IRA. And even 
if you are not eligible for a deductible IRA contribution -- because you 
already have a pension plan through your employer and exceed certain income 
limits -- you can still make deductible contributions into a Keogh. 
</P>
<P>
Also, although you must start withdrawing from your Keogh at age 70 1/2 -- just 
like with an IRA -- you still can keep contributing after that age as long as 
you continue to earn self-employment income. IRA contributions are no longer 
allowed after that point. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, not all is a picnic with Keoghs. There are some drawbacks. 
</P>
<P>
To set up a Keogh, you'll need some advice from an accountant, attorney or 
other expert. The process is much more complicated than with an IRA; a lot more 
paper work is involved. And there are a lot more rules governing how often and 
how much you must contribute. 
</P>
<P>
Also, if you have employees who work for you in your self-employment business, 
you must include them in your Keogh, which in effect becomes your business's 
pension plan. The Keogh is subject to various rules, including provisions 
preventing you as owner from benefiting disproportionately compared to your 
employees.

MUTUAL FUNDS: STRATEGIES TO RIDE OUT A RECESSION -- OR WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES is editor of Personal Investor, a national 
consumer-finance magazine based in Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that a recession has almost certainly arrived, the next question is: How 
bad will it get? Opinions vary, and so do your options as a mutual fund 
investor. 
</P>
<P>
The conventional outlook calls for a modest slowdown, followed by a recovery 
several months hence. Depending on whom you talk to, either stock funds or 
higher-quality bond portfolios would do well under this scenario. 
</P>
<P>
A minority viewpoint sees the economy getting much worse, perhaps even skidding 
into a 1930s-style depression. In this case, bond or money market funds that 
hold Treasury securities would probably be your best bet. 
</P>
<P>
It's this third scenario that most worries Don Evans of Evans, Brinkerhof &amp; 
Nelson, a money management firm in South Laguna Beach. "We feel an economic 
storm is coming, and we want to be out of the way," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Evans subscribes to the "Kondratieff wave" theory, an idea put forth by a 
Soviet economist decades ago that predicts major economic busts every 60 years 
or so. Evans sees parallels between now and the 1920s in areas such as Third 
World indebtedness, farm bankruptcies and corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
He's especially worried about the high levels of debt throughout the global 
economy. Evans suspects that people could become so wary of borrowing that they 
wouldn't do so even if the Federal Reserve continues to lower interest rates -- 
a scenario that would hinder the government's ability to stimulate the economy. 
He predicts a prolonged, painful bout of deflation -- a condition hardly felt 
in this country since the '30s -- and a stock market crash that could take the 
Dow Jones industrial index down to between 1,500 and 1,700, maybe lower. 
</P>
<P>
To prepare for all this, Evans recommends only Treasury bills or money market 
funds that hold them. 
</P>
<P>
John Dessauer, publisher of Dessauer's Journal of Financial Markets, a 
newsletter based in Orleans, Mass., scoffs at such predictions of deflation and 
depression. The key difference between now and the late '20s, he says, is that 
our understanding of how to manage economic problems has become much better. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1929 and 1932, Dessauer says, the nation's money supply contracted by 
more than 32% -- a factor that made the Depression worse. By the late '30s, the 
Federal Reserve had reversed this policy, and economic growth picked up. "The 
lesson of the 1930s is that governments can counter the downward pull of a 
severe economic crisis by expanding the money supply," he argues. 
</P>
<P>
And in recent weeks, the Federal Reserve has started to do just that, Dessauer 
says. This leads him to believe that the nation is roughly halfway through the 
current recession. He recommends buying stocks or stock funds now because the 
market will likely rise before the economy does, in anticipation of a recovery. 
"You have to buy stocks before things improve to get the big gains." 
</P>
<P>
The real long-term danger, Dessauer says, is not deflation but accelerating 
inflation, although he doesn't see that happening anytime soon. Rather, he 
forecasts moderate inflation for the near term -- a prognosis that bolsters his 
pro-equity stance since stocks have historically fared well in a mildly 
inflationary environment. 
</P>
<P>
But to guard against the possibility of either double-digit inflation or some 
type of economic or political crisis, Dessauer recommends keeping a small 
portion of your portfolio in precious metals -- bullion, gold mining stocks or 
gold mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Berger, a vice president at Paine Webber in Beverly Hills, offers yet 
another outlook. She believes that we're in the early stages of a recession and 
expects both inflation and interest rates to come down in the months ahead. The 
best way to profit from this, she says, is to invest in bonds or bond mutual 
funds. The bond market has been rallying since late September on signs of a 
slowing economy. She sees more interest rate cuts in store. 
</P>
<P>
While falling rates would tend to boost the value of bond investments in 
general, Berger suggests sticking with top-quality holdings. Since a weakening 
economy could increase the number of bankruptcies, she sees no reason to stray 
from Treasury bonds, highly rated municipal bonds or debt issued by U.S. 
government agencies -- as well as mutual funds that specialize in these areas. 
"The yield spread (on lower-rated bonds) might be wide, but it's not worth the 
risk," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Notably, Berger recommends longer-term bonds and bond funds because their 
prices can be expected to rise most dramatically if rates continue to head 
lower. She advises against keeping assets tied up in money market funds or bank 
CDs, since their yields will decline as interest rates fall. Besides, these 
vehicles don't offer any capital gains potential, unlike bonds and bond funds. 
</P>
<P>
Just to be safe, Berger recommends maintaining some exposure to a traditional, 
long-term inflation hedge, such as real estate, precious metals or stocks. 
"Economics is an inexact science," she points out. "You can never be exactly 
sure what will happen." 
</P>
<P>
That's the thinking behind asset allocation mutual funds, which take hedging to 
an extreme by holding several types of investments at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Blanchard Strategic Growth Fund of New York has its portfolio 
spread among bonds, U.S. stocks, foreign equities, cash and precious metals. By 
holding a mixture of assets that won't all rise and fall together, the fund is 
shooting for consistent gains while hoping to avoid any severe losses. 
</P>
<P>
"We see six to nine months more of recession, with inflation under control," 
says Michael Freedman, the fund's president. "We don't feel inflation is a big 
risk, nor do we expect a deep recession." With that in mind, Blanchard 
Strategic Growth has its largest position in bonds, at 35% of assets, followed 
by foreign stocks (25%), U.S. equities (20%), cash (10%) and precious metals 
(10%). 
</P>
<P>
In short, with the economy heading into recession, nobody knows how bad it 
might get. You can protect against stock market crashes and economic 
catastrophes by parking your cash in money market funds. You can capitalize on 
deflationary pressures by investing in top-quality bond funds, whose prices 
rise as interest rates fall. 
</P>
<P>
If you don't think the current slump will be severe or simply don't know what's 
in store, a good bet is to maintain a well-rounded portfolio that includes at 
least a small holding in stocks or stock funds. Over time, inflation, not 
deflation, has been the norm, and stocks, not bonds, have been the investment 
of choice. And there's no better time to invest in equities than at the bottom 
of a recession. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE ULTIMATE DEFLATION HEDGE 
</P>
<P>
In a deflationary environment, with interest rates falling, bond prices in 
general would rally. However, long-term zero-coupon Treasury bonds could make 
especially good investments. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
Zero-coupon bonds don't pay current interest. Instead, they're sold at a 
discount to their par value and gradually appreciate to that price by the time 
they mature. Because zeros don't pay interest, buyers lock in a yield that 
becomes increasingly appealing when interest rates fall. That's why zeros tend 
to appreciate more than other bonds in this circumstance. By the same token, 
zeros get hit harder by rising interest rates. On longer-term zeros, these 
price fluctuations are more extreme. Only if you plan to hold to maturity can 
you ignore this volatility. 
</P>
<P>
One key advantage of Treasury zeros is that they're backed by the federal 
government, which is unlikely to default even in a depression. And unlike other 
types of bonds, Treasury securities generally can't be "called," or redeemed 
prior to maturity at the issuer's option. 
</P>
<P>
You can buy individual Treasury zeros through a broker. Benham Capital 
Management (800-472-3389) and Scudder, Stevens &amp; Clark (800-225-2470) offer 
no-load zero-coupon Treasury bond funds. Either way, you get some deflation 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
The following chart, prepared by Benham, estimates how a change in interest 
rates would affect various Treasury securities:

MARKETS: SEIDMAN GETS MAN OF YEAR AWARD FOR GIVING US THE LOWDOWN ON BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRUDELE, JOHN CRUDELE is a financial columnist for the New York Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
L. William Seidman's job is in peril, but that hasn't stopped the outspoken 
head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. from trotting around the country 
telling anyone who will listen that the U.S. banking industry is in trouble. 
Seidman, of course, is already the bearer of bad news about the savings and 
loan industry, so his candor about banks isn't fully appreciated in some 
political circles. 
</P>
<P>
But it is appreciated here. At a time the economy and banking system are, by 
most accounts, in serious trouble, it's nice to hear some frank talk coming 
from Washington. Because of his big mouth, Seidman wins this year's Man of the 
Year award. 
</P>
<P>
My annual awards may not be as prestigious and lucrative as Pulitzers or 
Nobels, but at least you don't have to do much to win. In Seidman's case, all 
he had to do was defy the White House by issuing gloomy predictions about the 
banking system at the worst time politically -- before the recent congressional 
elections. That wasn't too tough for the 69-year-old accountant and educator, 
especially since Seidman is guaranteed a job until next October. 
</P>
<P>
Last year's winner, former Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson, 
also was picked because of his habit of speaking out of turn. On Oct. 15, 1989, 
Johnson leaked to the press the fact that the Fed would not permit the stock 
market to crash again -- even as it was doing just that. Those comments -- 
issued surreptitiously and apparently without the knowledge of Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan -- won Johnson the heartfelt gratitude of thousands of 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson undoubtedly used his Man of the Year award earlier this year to help 
land himself a high-paying job with the Washington-based consulting firm Smick 
Medley International, which promptly changed its name to give Johnson top 
billing. 
</P>
<P>
Seidman may also be looking for new employment soon. There were widespread 
rumors earlier this year that a peeved President Bush would not reappoint him 
as head of the FDIC and the Resolution Trust Corp. when his term expires -- and 
was even pressing for his resignation. Bill Seidman can use me as a reference. 
</P>
<P>
I also present: 
</P>
<P>
* The Little Old Ant Award -- Remember the lyric, "Just what makes that little 
old ant/Think he can move a rubber tree plant"? Well, the unions at UAL Corp. 
have had high hopes that they could pull off a $4-billion acquisition of the 
airline for more than three years. But they weren't as lucky as the ants. Tight 
credit, higher loan standards and old-fashioned common sense killed their 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
* Plain Vanilli Memorial Award -- Was that really President Bush singing the 
anti-tax tune when he got elected? Or was he merely lip-syncing some words 
taxpayers wanted to hear? Everyone with a wallet knows by now that the 
President couldn't keep his promise not to raise taxes. And it is plain as can 
be that, with revenues dropping during the recession, taxes will have to 
continue rising until the federal budget deficit is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
So here's some advice (in addition to the award) for President Bush: Don't 
raise the same old sin taxes. Instead, find some new sins to tax. 
</P>
<P>
How about a $1 tax on the rental of R-rated and NC17-rated videotapes? And who 
would complain if there is a 50-cent-a-gallon levy on fattening premium ice 
cream? 
</P>
<P>
And let's sock all those little Nintendo fanatics with a tax. Maybe $5 extra on 
a cartridge would get kids to quit playing video games and make them watch more 
TV like the rest of us. And how about a $1,000 tax on all firearms -- imposed 
on manufacturers and importers? This way the budget deficit could be balanced 
and Americans could still have the right to bear harm. 
</P>
<P>
* The Granny Award -- Ma Bell, also known as AT&amp;T, gets this pitted silver 
trophy for handling its proposed takeover of NCR Corp. with the delicacy 
usually reserved for underfed linebackers. AT&amp;T isn't smart enough to make 
its own computers successful, so it wants not only to pick the brains of NCR's 
experts but also to own their brains. 
</P>
<P>
So how does AT&amp;T go about doing this? Instead of engaging in the delicate 
diplomacy of winning NCR over by making an offer too good to legally refuse, it 
declares war. And this war is likely to lobotomize NCR. This shareholder, for 
one, thinks AT&amp;T should have gone the extra mile. 
</P>
<P>
* The Giant Eraser -- This is given to the bulk of the economists in this 
country -- including the hierarchy of the Fed -- because they couldn't see the 
economy sliding into a recession. These include all the predictors of the 
fabled "soft landing" for the economy. 
</P>
<P>
Even though business conditions were obviously deteriorating during the spring 
and early summer, the vast majority of these experts waited for Saddam 
Hussein's takeover of Iraq in August before getting out their erasers and 
changing their upbeat business forecasts. Some waited even longer -- until 
after Washington had botched the budget talks -- before abandoning the 
optimism. 
</P>
<P>
The eraser will come in handy for future forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
* MVP -- Donald J. Trump has been hitting most of the curve balls thrown by his 
creditors over the fence, so he is a runaway winner for Most Visible Pauper. He 
gives new meaning to the phrase "house poor." 
</P>
<P>
* Professor Emeritrash -- Junk bond king Michael Milken not only got himself an 
endowed chair in a federal prison for 10 years, but he also managed to become a 
symbol of 1980s decadence. This despite his moderate lifestyle and 
well-publicized acts of charity. 
</P>
<P>
But let's not be too hard on Milken. He may have preached the gospel of junk, 
but he didn't force anybody to get knee-deep in the slime.

Investors Discounted the Latest Fed Easing 
</P>
<P>
If the Federal Reserve Board were a gunslinger, it would have fired its final 
bullet last week at its target, the economy. But as far as the stock market is 
concerned, the accuracy of the aim and the potency of the projectile are still 
in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
That's the long way of explaining why stock prices didn't rally strongly when 
the Fed made its most overt move yet at injecting some life in the staggering 
economy. While the half-point drop in the discount rate did cause a 30-minute 
flurry of buying on Wall Street this past Tuesday, the action didn't create a 
sense of euphoria or even relief. 
</P>
<P>
"The market is very much into a 'What are you going to do for me today and 
tomorrow?' " says Ellen Harris, chief investment officer of Paine Webber Inc.'s 
domestic mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
As far as Wall Street was concerned, this past week's cut to 6 1/2% in the rate 
that the Fed charges banks to borrow money from the central bank was 
yesterday's news -- widely anticipated and with more symbolic than real 
importance. The central bank had already reduced reserve requirements for banks 
(bullet No. 1 and tinkered with the Fed funds rate (bullet No. 2). 
</P>
<P>
"One of the reasons people get bullish when the Fed cuts interest rates is 
because it is supposed to stimulate the economy," says Francis Scotland, 
managing editor of International Bank Credit Analyst, a publication located in 
Montreal. This time, says Scotland, the market didn't become optimistic because 
it isn't certain that the recent Fed moves will have a beneficial impact on 
business. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed, says Scotland, "will have to cut interest rates a lot more before the 
stock market and the economy can be expected to bottom out, let alone recover." 
He adds that the Federal Reserve may even have to "overreact" before it can get 
banks to lend again and borrowers to go further into debt. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial index, of course, is up more than 250 points from its 
October yearly low. Much of that gain, experts say, was the market anticipating 
a drop in interest rates. But the improvement is also partially due to an 
occasional easing in Mideast tensions, and to professional money managers who 
want to get "winning" stocks their portfolios before year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Hugh Johnson, chief market strategist with First Albany Corp., thinks the Fed's 
action on borrowing costs will eventually recharge the economy. "It's one of 
the many pieces that goes into the elaborate configuration that in time will 
turn confidence," Johnson says. 
</P>
<P>
The big question, however, is how much time it will take for the economy to 
respond. Johnson believes that the reaction to the Fed's recent moves may be 
delayed because the financial system in this country is unable to benefit as it 
has in the past to monetary stimulus. "What we are seeing is the results of the 
financial excesses of the 1980s," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson believes that it would be premature for the stock market to start 
cheering what the Fed is doing. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently the market agrees. 
</P>
<P>
Square D Co.'s stock has been climbing on takeover rumors, the origin of which 
-- until now -- was unknown. It turns out that a French firm, Schneider AG, 
raised $1 billion and is rumored to be interested in "strategic" moves. Since 
Schneider, which is in construction, once bought a company in Square D's field 
-- electrical equipment -- the takeover rumor was a natural development. Square 
D has denied any development that would be affecting its stock . . . Stock 
options are a valuable executive perk, but they are worthless when a company's 
shares have fallen below the price at which the options can be exercised. Even 
though that has happened in many cases the last few months, consultant Towers 
Perrin says only 8% of 95 companies it surveyed planned to reissue executive 
stock options on more favorable terms. Life in the executive suite isn't always 
wonderful . . . But KPMG Peat Marwick, the accounting firm, says directors are 
being treated a whole lot better these days. Top-paid directors get a retainer 
of $20,000 to $25,000 a year, plus between $700 and $1,000 per board meeting. 
That's substantially higher than the prior year. Some firms, such as Burlington 
Northern and Compaq Computer, are even giving directors equity in the 
companies.

<P>
'Baby Boomerangers' May Factor Into Slump 
</P>
<P>
If this recession turns out to be a bad one, at least one economist says you 
can place a lot of the blame on the "baby boomerangers." 
</P>
<P>
Richard F. Hokenson, which specializes in demographics, says the large number 
of young adults (especially men) who are returning to live with their parents 
is keeping the growth in new households down to unreasonably low levels. And 
without new households springing for things such as refrigerators, sofas and 
beds, the economy will suffer. 
</P>
<P>
Hokenson says that between March, 1989, and March, 1990, only 517,000 new 
households were forced in the United States. That's growth of just 0.56%. 
</P>
<P>
The only periods in this country's recent history that were worse, he says, 
were between 1982 and 1983, when there was growth of 0.47%, and 1931 to 1932, 
when new households increased 0.47%. 
</P>
<P>
"That such a small gain precedes the onset of the current recession is an 
ominous precedent for the downturn that is now unfolding," says Hokenson. 
</P>
<P>
"Household formations always slow as the recession takes hold because part of 
the decision on whether you maintain your own household and move out of your 
parent's home is a function of the economy," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
Hokenson says the number of households in the country could shrink during this 
recession, which would be the first time that has happened in this century. 
"Even during the Great Depression, households continued to grow," he added. 
</P>
<P>
Don't underestimate the importance of these statistics. Hokenson says nearly 
22% of the nation's gross national product is connected with the home. 
</P>
<P>
Housing, of course, could be affected by the smaller growth in new households. 
But if you look around your own home, you can figure out for yourself which 
other industries might be hurt.

TERMS OF THE U.S. EMBARGO ARE STRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERESA WATANABE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam prohibits Americans from engaging in 
virtually all forms of commercial relations with that nation. First imposed 
against the North Vietnamese in 1964 and extended to the entire country in 
1975, the sanctions include a freeze on all Vietnamese assets, a ban on 
financial transactions, travel restrictions and trade prohibitions in all 
fields except information. 
</P>
<P>
The embargo applies to all Americans wherever they live and U.S. subsidiaries 
incorporated abroad. Vietnamese-Americans wishing to take money to relatives 
are restricted to $300 per quarter or $750 to relatives preparing to emigrate. 
In addition, the law imposes a $200 per day spending restriction on any 
American in Vietnam. Americans are also prohibited from entering or leaving 
Vietnam on the state carrier, Air Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
However, the embargo does not prohibit Americans from visiting Vietnam, meeting 
with Vietnamese officials, collecting information or even entering into 
non-binding agreements. 
</P>
<P>
The sanctions are based on the 1917 Trading With the Enemy Act, which allows 
the President to impose a broad range of economic sanctions to further U.S. 
foreign policy interests. Other examples include sanctions against Nicaragua 
and South Africa in 1985, Libya in 1986, Panama in 1988 and the current embargo 
against Iraq and Kuwait. But the measures against Vietnam constitute the 
fullest scope of sanctions possible and are similarly imposed only against 
Cuba, North Korea and Cambodia, according to a U.S. Treasury official. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Congress passed one exception to the embargo that allows the exchange 
of books, records, newspapers, dictionaries and other information. As a result, 
Cable News Network was allowed to install a satellite dish in Vietnam. Another 
American, a Maryland entrepreneur, was recently given approval to import books 
and newspapers from Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Violations of the law carry maximum criminal penalties of 12 years in prison 
and fines of $250,000 for individuals and $1 million for corporations. Treasury 
officials could not provide statistics on the number of violations. But the 
most celebrated case involves Lindblad Travel, a Westport, Conn., firm that 
went bankrupt under the weight of more than $500,000 in fines after pleading 
guilty last year to arranging tours to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. business community really tries to bend over backward to comply with 
the law, and if there are any questions, your readers should give us a call," a 
Treasury official said. TERESA WATANABE

OPTIMISTIC RETAILERS BREATHING NEW LIFE INTO MEXICO CITY'S RODEO DRIVE; 
</P>
<P>
TOURISM: SUBURBAN MALLS HAD HURT THE ZONA ROSA. WITH GOVERNMENT MONEY SHORT, 
MERCHANTS DECIDED ON A SELF-HELP EFFORT TO REJUVENATE IT.

MEXICO CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This Christmas season, city officials and merchants are working together to 
polish away the tarnish that has settled on the Zona Rosa, the city's 
fashionable shopping and cafe district. 
</P>
<P>
Poinsettias bloom from recently finished flower beds on the main pedestrian 
thoroughfare, Calle Genova, where 60,000 people pass daily. Donated sculptures 
are being installed. Restaurateurs have received long-delayed permits for 
outdoor cafes. Retailers are sprucing up their building facades and expanding. 
</P>
<P>
Just this Thursday, Mexico City dedicated the Zona Rosa urban renewal project, 
amid optimism that new life can be breathed into the Pink Zone, for years 
Mexico City's equivalent of Beverly Hills' Rodeo Drive or New York's Fifth 
Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"This kind of mutual effort also could work in other parts of the city," said 
Jorge Castro, president of the Zona Rosa Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
During an interview in his office above Konditori, his Danish restaurant, 
Castro spoke excitedly about the year of negotiations and work that went into 
the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"The Zona Rosa had become rundown and needed major maintenance," he said. "But 
in the economic crisis, the government had other priorities. What little money 
there was had to be spent on public housing, for example." 
</P>
<P>
So the merchants decided that fixing up the common areas would be an investment 
-- an attempt to halt what city residents say has been two decades of 
deterioration. They spent $30,000 on building materials, while the city 
contributed the workers and machinery to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
The Zona Rosa is a 20-block district that radiates from the intersection of the 
city's two main boulevards, Paseo de la Reforma and Avenida Insurgentes. 
</P>
<P>
Until World War II, it was a fashionable residential area. Then, the houses 
along streets named for European cities were gradually converted to boutiques, 
art galleries and restaurants that served German, Spanish or Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
During his student days in the 1960s, recalls economist Rogelio Ramirez de la 
O, the Zona Rosa was the place for the elite to gather on weekend afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
"Mexico City has always been a city of neighborhoods," he said during a walk in 
the district down Calle Belgrado. "This was a place to meet people from outside 
your neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1969, a major subway stop was built on the edge of the Zona Rosa, 
surrounded by a mini-mall of discount stores and taco stands that clashed with 
the designer shops and European restaurants. The district began to lose its 
allure. 
</P>
<P>
The oil boom of the 1970s brought U.S.-style shopping malls to the upper-class 
suburbs. The elite no longer needed to shop in the Zona Rosa as the areas's 
boutiques, restaurants and even hair-styling salons opened branches in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
The artists and writers who had lived in apartments above the shops and cafes, 
contributing to the area's bohemian air, began to move out after the earthquake 
of 1985 devastated surrounding neighborhoods and left them feeling insecure. 
</P>
<P>
And then, during the prolonged economic crisis of the 1980s, the line of 
card-table stands displaying street vendors' merchandise gradually grew from 
the subway stop toward the Zona Rosa. More beggars and fortune tellers 
circulated among the outdoor diners. Tourists told stories of being robbed at 
knifepoint. 
</P>
<P>
"There were days when we had to close the door because there were fights in the 
street outside," recalled Carlos Kleiman, owner of La Gondola, an Italian 
restaurant in the area. 
</P>
<P>
Longstanding establishments, such as La Pergola restaurant, moved to 
less-troubled neighborhoods near the city's famed Chapultepec Park. 
</P>
<P>
"That was really a loss," said Kleiman. "The better places there are, the more 
likely people are to think of the Zona Rosa as a place to eat. They are not 
going to eat at the same restaurant every day." 
</P>
<P>
The Zona Rosa clearly was in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
However, a new metropolitan land-use plan that restricted hotel construction in 
other parts of the city focused attention on the need to revive the flagging 
tourism zone. Forbidden from building in other areas, hoteliers took a new look 
and began announcing plans for buildings in areas near the Zona Rosa, promising 
an influx of affluent customers. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, a group of young entrepreneurs began buying the old Zona Rosa 
restaurants and shops, bringing a new enthusiasm for improving the area. 
</P>
<P>
The merchants association found the city's new mayor more willing to work with 
them, said Castro. A change in Mexican franchise laws brought the area an 
infusion of U.S. fast-food restaurants, considered trendy in Mexico. That has 
helped too. 
</P>
<P>
The recent face lift undertaken by the new generation of Zona Rosa merchants 
has generated some controversy, however, particularly over stepped-up security, 
which merchants demanded. 
</P>
<P>
Besides adding more unarmed tourism officers, who offer directions and advice 
in a variety of languages, the police have begun a crackdown on cabarets that 
do not fit the image city officials want for the area. 
</P>
<P>
Some patrons complain that officials have been exceptionally eager in recent 
weeks to close down gay bars. They consider that particularly unfair, because 
the gay community has helped sustain the Zona Rosa during the lean years. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants counter that the bars that were closed in recent weeks had brought in 
rowdy groups that drove away other customers. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, this week's ceremony is only the beginning of an uphill battle. 
The city's resources still are limited, and Mexico's elite still can shop and 
eat in suburban malls, far from urban problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Zona Rosa merchants, however, are optimistic for the first time in years. 
Roofed malls cannot replicate the open-air atmosphere and tradition of the 
urban district, they say. 
</P>
<P>
"The sculpture walkway will become a cultural place where school groups visit," 
Castro predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Not that merchants have any choice but to do all they can to revive the area, 
Kleiman acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to bring ourselves back up to international levels of service and 
products," he said. "There is a lot of competition in the world. We have to go 
after the customer."

DOG DAYS by Mavis Cheek (Simon &amp; Schuster: $18.95; 221 pp.). In the battle 
of the sexes, Mavis Cheek fights fair. No thumbs in her male characters' eyes, 
no ideological lead weights in her gloves; just a stinging jab in the face of 
fatuity and a quick hook to the funny bone. 
</P>
<P>
Attitude counts, because "Dog Days," reduced to a plot outline, is nothing more 
than a generic feminist novel with a romantic ending tacked on -- a novel, 
moreover, that depends on the flimsiest of contrivances: an apparently married 
man who turns out, in the nick of time, to be single and available. 
</P>
<P>
But a novel isn't just a plot outline, as Cheek ("Parlor Games") artfully 
demonstrates. The voice of her heroine, Pat Murray, manages to be feisty, 
breezy, vulnerable and wise all at once. We listen to Pat describe her 
self-absorbed opera-singer husband, Gordon; her 10-year-old daughter, Rachel, 
who wants a dog "if I can't have Daddy"; her liberated women friends, who prod 
her to divorce Gordon but then can't bear the idea of her living alone -- not 
to mention the semi-comatose mutt she picks up at the pound for Rachel -- and 
we accept the validity of her judgments even as we chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
"Dog Days" has two morals. One is no longer trendy in this era of resurgent 
"family values": Having a child is no excuse to prolong an unhappy marriage. 
The other is downright old-fashioned: Life without love -- and risk -- is a 
dog's life. Novels need morals, just as fighters need to work out on the heavy 
bag. But the fun is in the rope-skipping and shadow-boxing: the witty take-offs 
on London middle-class existence, the back-fence spats, the office politics, 
the warm portraits of daughter and friends, the coy maneuvering at dinner 
parties that (contrary to stereotypes about the English) serve up raunchy talk 
and appetizing food. May the bell ring soon for Cheek's next round. Michael 
Harris

AN OLD SONG ENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By J. D. McCLATCHY 
</P>
<P>
at Christmas 
</P>
<P>
All earthly pomp or beauty to express 
</P>
<P>
Is but to carve in snow, on waves to write. 
</P>
<P>
Celestial things, though men conceive them less, 
</P>
<P>
Yet fullest are they in themselves of light; 
</P>
<P>
Such beams they yield as know no means to die, 
</P>
<P>
Such heat they cast as lifts the spirit high. 
</P>
<P>
Your tire tracks have spoiled the snow outside, 
</P>
<P>
And inside, where there's something wrong, the stem's 
</P>
<P>
Corrupt but slick subtext is magnified 
</P>
<P>
In the vase beneath a Star of Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
If nature disappoints, as it appears, 
</P>
<P>
Whom do we trust when each the other fears? 
</P>
<P>
When once the stars had crossed themselves to light 
</P>
<P>
A way for kings, or show as angels to the boy 
</P>
<P>
Minding his flock, who stares to see the night 
</P>
<P>
All changed into a story quick with joy, 
</P>
<P>
Now is nothing but fire, nothing but air. 
</P>
<P>
The only pattern here's this view, this chair 
</P>
<P>
It's difficult to look for long at snow, 
</P>
<P>
When most of heaven's fallen to earth out there. 
</P>
<P>
A scalding brilliance poured over the cold. 
</P>
<P>
Trees, the road, your car -- lost in the glare. 
</P>
<P>
To steep myself in light, then close my eyes . . . 
</P>
<P>
These winter days are darkness in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
Sunlight and snowlight streaming in behind. 
</P>
<P>
Is blindness, then the gift you give before 
</P>
<P>
The rest? -- forgiveness, say so hard to find 
</P>
<P>
In what's at hand, the common day which seems 
</P>
<P>
At last the light that yields such heat, such beams.

CLASSICS ON CASSETTE: 'SHORT STORIES OF KATHERINE MANSFIELD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ESPEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Born Kathleen Mansfield Beauchamp in 1888 in Wellington, New Zealand, Katherine 
Mansfield, as she chose to call herself as a writer, became one of the shapers 
of the modern short story. 
</P>
<P>
This collection of 15 unabridged titles has been skillfully chosen to show her 
development from her first experiments to her final triumphs. They are read 
perceptively in a sensitive variety of voices by Rosemary Harris, who won an 
Emmy for the role of George Sand in Masterpiece Theatre's "Notorious Woman" and 
a Tony for her portrayal of Eleanor of Aquitaine in "A Lion in Winter." 
</P>
<P>
Mansfield's work is so closely linked to her own life that at times it is 
impossible to separate them. Sent in 1903 to Queen's College, London, by her 
upper-middle-class parents -- her father was a successful banker -- she learned 
something of the larger world during the next three years and returned 
reluctantly to her home only on the insistence of her family. She already had 
begun to publish brief sketches and finally persuaded her father to give her a 
small allowance that let her return in 1908 to London and the free-spirited 
life that she was determined to experience. 
</P>
<P>
Married on March 2, 1909, to George Bowden, 11 years her senior, she left him 
on the following day. By May, she was pregnant by another man, a Polish 
musician, and retreated to Bavaria, where she first read a selection of 
Chekov's stories, in German translation. They led her to the discovery of her 
true bent, giving her a form and a technique to handle the sudden flashes of 
perception that characterized her earliest work. Following a miscarriage, she 
returned to London and began publishing seriously in the New Age, a socialist 
journal. 
</P>
<P>
After living briefly with her husband, she left him again, had an abortion in 
the spring of 1911 after another affair, and published her first collection, 
"In a German Pension," most of its harsh, satiric material based on her 
Bavarian stay. In the following year she met and began living with John 
Middleton Murry, an eccentric critic and editor, whom she was to marry in 1918 
after her divorce from Bowden. She and Murry spent the winter of 1913-14 in 
Paris, where she wrote her first long story, "Something Childish but Very 
Natural," a delicate, dreamlike treatment of an adolescent love affair, 
tenderly read here by Rosemary Harris. Another turning point in Mansfield's 
life came with World War I, when her younger brother Leslie arrived in London 
during February of 1915 to join his regiment. The brother brought back to his 
sister both happy and not so happy memories of their childhood. On Oct. 7, 
Leslie was killed in action, and Katherine deliberately turned to writing about 
their early family life in New Zealand, ultimately producing three of her 
greatest stories: "Prelude," "At the Bay" and "The Garden Party," all included 
in this collection. 
</P>
<P>
Never entirely comfortable in the established literary circles of London, 
Mansfield was both attracted to their members and at the same time felt 
socially insecure among them as well as critical of their work. A friendship 
with Virginia Woolf started out promisingly only to end in mutually wary 
dislike. Mansfield confided to Murry that she felt Woolf's "Night and Day" "a 
lie in the soul," and Woolf said of "Bliss," one of Mansfield's treatments of 
the intelligentsia, that "the whole conception is poor, cheap, not the vision . 
. . of an interesting mind." After listening to Harris' sympathetic reading 
here, you are free to make your own judgment, and perhaps suspect that 
something as uncool as jealousy, from the point of view of the Bloomsbury 
Group, might be involved. Whatever your decision, the stories of the two show 
striking similarities at times, with the New Zealand upstart frequently the 
leader in experiment. 
</P>
<P>
Her health always precarious, Mansfield spent most of her winters on the 
Continent, leading to frequent separations from Murry. In "The Man Without a 
Temperament," she creates a reunion in which the husband, outwardly attentive 
to the needs of his wife's illness, lives inwardly altogether in their past. In 
actual life, however, their marriage endured through all the difficulties they 
had to face, even after Mansfield clearly was in the advanced stages of 
tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
In her exploration of the human condition, Mansfield is most effective in her 
treatment of the sudden revelations of everyday life, frequently those 
experienced by women and children. Though dealing in both the imagined and 
given worlds of isolated and lonely figures, she never would have risked on 
paper a climax as dramatic as her own. 
</P>
<P>
Losing faith in the radium treatments prescribed by her doctor, she eventually 
entered the Gurdjieff Institute at Fontainebleau, believing she could cure 
herself under the Russian mystic's care. Here she experienced what is called in 
Medical Latin spes phthisica, "consumptive hope," a false belief in complete 
recovery, leading to radiant optimism about the future. 
</P>
<P>
Murry was able to visit her on Jan. 9, 1923, and they spent a happy afternoon 
and evening together. Then, as she started upstairs to her room, a massive 
hemorrhage felled her and she died in a matter of minutes.

THE FRESHNESS OF FIRST IMPRESSIONS; 
</P>
<P>
LANDSCAPE: MEMORY BY MATTHEW STADLER (CHARLES SCRIBNER'S SONS: $19.95; 301 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Sometimes life seems to unfold like a prearranged story whose plot we've heard 
before we've experienced it. Other times, experience seems to elude or 
overwhelm any attempt to pin it down in story or theory, pictures or words. 
</P>
<P>
A writer's first novel often is an attempt to strike a balance between evoking 
the freshness of undigested experience and finding a pattern or meaning to give 
form to inchoate feeling. 
</P>
<P>
Maxwell Kosegarten, the hero/narrator of Matthew Stadler's first novel, is a 
16-year-old boy adrift in a sea of feelings, memories and sensations, who is 
attempting to paint a landscape of a scene he remembers and at the same time is 
keeping a diary. Max also is facing the break-up of his parents' marriage, 
memories of a disastrous earthquake, the threat of a distant war, and the 
blossoming of erotic love between himself and a half-Persian boy called Duncan 
Taqdir, who has been his closest friend since both boys were 7. 
</P>
<P>
This, then, is a novel about adolescence, a diary of a young man on the verge 
of forging his erotic and artistic identity. Indeed, Max seems less concerned 
with how to cope with experience than with finding a way to preserve his 
perceptions in words or in paint. Entries from Max's diary are interspersed 
with sketches of the landscape he is trying to draw from memory. 
</P>
<P>
Apart from the illustrations, however, what distinguishes this first novel from 
others treating similar themes is Stadler's decision to set it in the early 
years of this century. Thus, Max is keeping his diary between 1914 and 1916, as 
echoes of World War I reverberate across an ocean and a continent in the form 
of letters from Max's Uncle Maury (an American who joins up as a medic with the 
British forces) and in the fascination Max feels for the erotic undercurrents 
of war as embodied in the poems of Rupert Brooke. 
</P>
<P>
Looming in the background are Max's memories of the great San Francisco 
earthquake, which happened when he was 7. Around him in the present, the city 
is staging its mammoth World's Fair, the Panama Pacific International 
Exhibition. Max's mother, a charming suffragist who is introducing Max to 
Ruskin's technique of landscape drawing, is herself posing for the fair's 
statue of Winged Victory. Mr. Taqdir, the father of Max's best friend, is 
sculpting her. Max's father, an ornithologist whose interest in nature's freaks 
and disasters has been passed on to his son, disapproves of the fair and 
everything about it. 
</P>
<P>
One feels somehow that by setting his story in the San Francisco of 1914-1916, 
Stadler is trying to provide added context and resonance. But his re-creation 
of that time seems inauthentic, the characters and their attitudes as modern as 
today. The scene in which the parents announce their impending separation, for 
example, has a sound that is distinctly post-1960s: 
</P>
<P>
" 'Your father and I, dearest,' she began again. 'Your father and I have agreed 
that it would be healthy for me to explore my feelings for Mr. Taqdir in a less 
encumbered atmosphere.' She smiled, as if this were a gift she'd given me. 
</P>
<P>
"I still didn't understand, but couldn't find the words to say so. I looked at 
my father and he shrugged a little shrug, nodding his head from side to side 
and brushing the crumbs from off his hands. 
</P>
<P>
" 'They're sleeping together, Max,' he said. 'They're lovers. I'd rather not 
stick around for it.' Mother wrinkled her brow at him. 'Anyway, it's a 
beautiful time of year to be in Bolinas. I can get a lot done up there.' " 
</P>
<P>
Later, when Max and Duncan embark on their love affair, no one, including the 
boys themselves, raises an eyebrow. True, the story is set in bohemian San 
Francisco among people who consider themselves modern. And in some sense, it 
may be fair to say that the suffragists and other "moderns" of that era were 
more truly avant-garde than those who followed in their wake. 
</P>
<P>
However, one feels a lack of historical texture in this book; it's not so much 
that the author has got things wrong as it is that he seems to lack any sense 
of historicity whatsoever. This is a prevalent lack in American fiction (as 
Henry James complained long ago), but it's all the more surprising in a novel 
that makes such a point of being set in a historical period that is meant (one 
suspects) to form a not-too-distant mirror of our own era. 
</P>
<P>
This lack of historicity finds a parallel, surely more than coincidental, in 
the shadow of the novel's characters. They are not portrayed as particular 
persons shaped by -- and responding to -- particular circumstances, but rather 
as figures at the edge of the youthful narrator's consciousness. All of which 
is simply to say that "Landscape: Memory" is less a traditional social novel 
than a Romantic lyrical novel, a kind of meditation on memory, art and the 
nature of subjectivity itself. Stadler's use of the historical setting is an 
understandable attempt to impose a kind of form on the hazy vicissitudes of 
adolescent emotion, but it is a form that doesn't quite fit. 
</P>
<P>
The strengths of "Landscape: Memory," however, are finally more basic than its 
flaws. It's a novel that tries to recover a sense of the freshness of first 
impressions and the primal innocence of sexuality (in this case, homosexuality) 
by portraying feeling itself, removed from historical, social or psychological 
conditioning. The only contingencies in this book are disaster, war and death. 
And as depicted here, they are less contingencies than eternal verities. 
</P>
<P>
There's something rather breathtaking, as well as uneasy-making, about the 
ambition and naivete of a novel like this one.

THE PERILS OF PANAMA; 
</P>
<P>
IN THE TIME OF THE TYRANTS; PANAMA: 1968-1990 BY R. M. KOSTER AND GUILLERMO 
SANCHEZ (W.W. NORTON: $22.95; 430 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kenneth Freed, Freed is chief of The Times bureau in El Salvador and 
regularly covers Panama. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In Panama they are called bolas, rumors that spread daily if not hourly through 
the society. Someone has died, another is sleeping with a friend's wife, a 
politician is planning a coup. One vice president nearly punched the other vice 
president during a cabinet meeting. Bolas touch on nearly every aspect of 
Panamanian life. 
</P>
<P>
Some bolas are funny, others meaningless, but many are taken seriously in 
Panama, so seriously that they frequently turn into the myths that too often 
become the basis of journalism or, worse, pass for history. 
</P>
<P>
A major example is the myth of Omar Torrijos, the handsome and dashing 
Panamanian colonel who held power from the late 1960s until his death in 1981. 
The myth of Torrijos is that he was a populist who took on the rich, white 
Panamanian establishment and the imperialist United States to bring the poor 
people of his country out of misery and to establish the political and economic 
independence for his nation by wresting the Panama Canal from the giant to the 
north. 
</P>
<P>
It was a myth bought by the British writer Graham Greene, President Jimmy 
Carter and many others. The truth was otherwise, as pointed out in "In the Time 
of the Tyrants." 
</P>
<P>
In what is the most valuable aspect of this book, the authors carefully remind 
a forgetful world that Torrijos was not a George Washington-like hero but an 
unstable colonel who, in the late 1960s with American complicity and approval, 
established and cemented military rule in Panama and defined its brutal and 
criminal nature. 
</P>
<P>
Koster and Sanchez also effectively explain that Torrijos' supposed greatest 
achievement -- new treaties giving sovereignty and control of the Panama Canal 
to Panama -- fell far short of what could have been accomplished, and even gave 
the United States rights it already had renounced. 
</P>
<P>
"In the Time of the Tyrants" contains some other positive aspects. With the 
United States still congratulating itself on throwing out Manuel Antonio 
Noriega a year ago and destroying the military structure that brutalized, raped 
and plundered Panama, Koster and Sanchez remind us again not only that Noriega 
was a paid agent of the American government but also that high U.S. officials 
-- including Presidents Reagan and Bush -- condoned, protected and publicly 
praised the dictator through most of his murderous rule. 
</P>
<P>
And as the Bush Administration, for its own political needs, pushes Panama to 
participate in Washington's war on drugs, even though it threatens the 
Panamanian economy and raises the specter of a militarized police force, "In 
the Time of the Tyrants" recalls how the United States for its own ends created 
a military institution unneeded by a peaceful society unable to protect itself. 
</P>
<P>
Yet while Koster and Sanchez demolish the myth of Torrijos and point out the 
hypocrisy of American policy regarding Noriega, much of what is valuable in 
this book is offset by the excesses and faults of the authors, particularly the 
portrayal of unsubstantiated gossip and rumors as facts. Their well-grounded 
disgust with and hate for Torrijos and Noriega has led Koster and Sanchez to 
perpetuate or create other bolas and myths unacceptable in serious journalism. 
</P>
<P>
What is sad is that the confirmed record of Torrijos, Noriega and the United 
States is so awful it needs no embellishment. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, in their central allegory of Noriega's total depravity -- the 
1985 murder by beheading of Dr. Hugo Spadafora, one of the dictator's most 
dangerous opponents -- Koster and Sanchez repeat accounts that Spadafora had 
been tortured and anally raped, and that Noriega's henchmen had cut his thigh 
muscles to prevent him from resisting. However, as John Dinges wrote earlier 
this year in "Our Man In Panama," which remains the most responsible and 
authoritative account of recent Panamanian history, an autopsy by an 
independent Costa Rican doctor showed no signs of sexual abuse or torture. 
</P>
<P>
Worse, Koster and Sanchez refer to Dinges as an apologist for Noriega, an 
absurd assertion to anyone who has read Dinges' book. 
</P>
<P>
The Spadafora murder stands on its own as an example of Noriega's depravity. 
There is no need to make him out as an even greater monster, particularly by 
using unsubstantiated rumors. In their loathing for Noriega and those American 
officials who supported and helped him, Koster and Sanchez also give total 
credence to the unconfirmed accounts of at least two former Noriega associates 
who turned on their onetime master as part of a plea bargain: political 
operative Jose Blandon and convicted money launderer Ramon Milian Rodriguez, 
described by the U.S. attorney's office in Miami as "wholly without 
credibility." As for Blandon, Dinges wrote: "Although Blandon undisputably had 
a major political role in Panamanian events and had inside knowledge of many 
major events in Panama, a significant number of his allegations defy 
confirmation and in some cases are implausible or demonstrably false." 
</P>
<P>
Again, the public and confirmed record against Noriega is so strong that it 
doesn't need the use of suspect and unsubstantiated testimony from special 
pleaders. 
</P>
<P>
With the anniversary of the U.S. invasion of Panama having just passed, this 
would be a good time for a serious examination of the reasons for the American 
action and its impact since. For the most part, "In the Time of the Tyrants" 
fails on both counts. It provides neither new information nor insight into the 
events that led to the Dec. 20, 1989, American attack nor a thoughtful look at 
the effects and implications of that drastic act. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is a surprise and a disappointment. Guillermo Sanchez is one of 
Panama's most influential journalists, a man who bravely and constantly exposed 
the barbarities, crimes and betrayals of the uniformed thugs and their civilian 
front men who ruled his country for more than 20 years. Few knew more and even 
fewer disclosed what was going on in the country, a knowledge he continues to 
display in a column for La Prensa, Panama's best newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
For his part, R.M. Koster, a longtime American resident of Panama, had a 
well-earned reputation as a writer, having published a engrossing novel in 1972 
called "The Prince," which was an amazingly prescient portrayal of a banana 
republic taken over by venal military men and turned into a center of 
corruption. 
</P>
<P>
On their records, Koster and Sanchez not only could have written a better book, 
they should have.

RUNNING IN THE FAMILY by Michael Ondaatje (Penguin: $6.95). A noted poet, 
novelist and film writer, Michael Ondaatje has compiled a series of brief 
sketches describing the antics of his dotty relatives in Ceylon during the '20s 
and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
Although both sides of his family had been prominent in Ceylonese society for 
generations, they all appear to have been as mad as hatters. Ondaatje describes 
his father as a gentle, if ineffectual man -- until he went on one of his 
periodic binges, when he would stop trains by brandishing his Army pistols in 
the passenger cars, or by hiding naked in the tunnels. Near the end of her 
riches-to-rags life, his grandmother had to be barred from public parks because 
she insisted on picking the flowers and giving them away with the prodigal 
generosity she had displayed during her wealthy youth. Funny and oddly 
enchanting, Ondaatje's prose evokes a happier time in Ceylon, before ethnic 
strife shattered the island's tranquil existence. Charles Solomon.

THE CHINCHILLA FARM by Judith Freeman (Vintage: $9.95). This highly readable 
first novel uses a woman's travels as a metaphor for the search for self- 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
Verna Flake leaves a crumbling marriage and a grimly righteous Mormon 
upbringing behind when she quits a flyspeck Utah town for Los Angeles, but she 
soon discovers that life is no easier at the rainbow's end. The insipid routine 
of her low-paying office job allows her mind to wander back to her childhood, 
when she watched a neighbor raise chinchillas in a get-rich-quick scheme. Verna 
contrasts the devotion of the diminutive rodents, who mate for life and pine 
away if anything happens to their partners, with her own failed marriage and 
the messes her friends have made of their lives. The example of the chinchillas 
enables Verna to overcome her initial resistance and establish what she hopes 
will be a more permanent bond with a nervous composer. Charles Solomon.

THE BEST JAPANESE SCIENCE FICTION STORIES, edited by John L. Apostolous and 
Martin H. Greenberg (Dembner: $9.95). This very mixed bag of stories includes 
work by noted mainstream authors Kobo Abe and Morio Kite, as well as genre 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Although they contain some native elements, most of the stories are 
surprisingly derivative of Western models, especially the writings of Isaac 
Asimov, Ray Bradbury and Arthur C. Clarke. Sakyo Komatsu's "The Savage Mouth" 
transforms a Japanese ritual suicide into a grisly fantasy of self-cannibalism. 
"Standing Woman" by Yasutaka Tsutsui combines a reverence for nature with a 
bizarre form of capital punishment that turns people into trees. Ryo Hanmura's 
"Cardboard Box" is a nicely written fantasy, but its subject suggests an 
assignment for a basic creative-writing class. If the 14th Amendment didn't 
prohibit it, some Japanese publishing conglomerate probably would try to buy 
Asimov, Bradbury et al. Charles Solomon.

A JAUNTY NONCHALANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is every reviewer's (sometimes secret) ambition to write a review that 
stands on its own as a fine piece of work. 
</P>
<P>
All too often, time, circumstance, bad luck, a faltering talent, turn this 
ambition to folly. 
</P>
<P>
But Grover Lewis' splendid review of "Pastures of Plenty" by Woody Guthrie 
(Dec. 2) must be an inspiration to reviewers and readers everywhere. Lewis' 
lovely Texan prose, his knowledge of the subject matter, his almost 
terrifyingly jaunty, nonchalant expertise on the underclass -- its horrors, its 
triumphs -- made your front page a blast! 
</P>
<P>
What a treat to see Grover Lewis' good work again.

THE DODO LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jon Carroll's review of Christian Vaisse's "Living in Mauritius" (Nov. 25) has 
a curious error. 
</P>
<P>
Former (not now) President (Leopold) Senghor of Senegal is described as 
President of Mauritius. Actually, he has never even visited Mauritius, where 
there are very few black Africans. 
</P>
<P>
The island, once the home of the extinct dodo bird, is overwhelmingly Indian 
with a Hindu majority, along with a minority of white people of French 
extraction. 
</P>
<P>
To its credit, Mauritius is the only member of the Organization of African 
Unity which has twice voted a government out of office and then let the new 
opposition come to power.

Known around the world as the romantic masked rider, Zorro, he gave us a 
timeless rendition of a legend -- and thus, became a legend himself.

<TEXT>
<P>
As others rejoice in the safe homecoming of American hostages from Iraq and 
Kuwait, Claudia Ledesma celebrates the holiday season stoically in San Diego, 
behind a tinsel veneer of good cheer. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband of eight years remains in Kuwait, a captive in his own country. 
</P>
<P>
They have not talked since their separation Sept. 7, when Ledesma and the 
couple's four young boys -- including newborn twins -- flew to the safety of 
her parents' home. 
</P>
<P>
She has heard indirectly from him four times -- in communications relayed by 
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait and, once last week, through a friend's phone call 
from Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Now that the embassy has been vacated, Ledesma can only hope to hear of her 
husband's safety through friends. She holds no hope of direct contact -- no 
telephone calls, no cables, no letters. 
</P>
<P>
So as other families that were torn by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 are 
reunited for the holidays, 27-year-old Ledesma and her four boys can only hope 
and pray and wonder. 
</P>
<P>
A Dec. 2 message, relayed by U.S. Embassy officials, let Ledesma know that her 
husband would not try to escape from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Dear Claudia, I love you so much and I love the children. Take care of them. 
God bless America. I have decided to stay until this is over." 
</P>
<P>
The last she heard of her husband was word passed on by the friend calling from 
Baghdad last Monday. "The message was: 'Don't worry. I'm fine. Merry Christmas 
and Happy New Year!" Ledesma said. 
</P>
<P>
She has resigned herself to being separated from her husband until peace comes 
to the Persian Gulf. "How could he leave? That is his country." 
</P>
<P>
Fearing for his safety, Ledesma does not want his identity made public -- nor 
even the specifics of his job in Kuwait before the invasion, except that he was 
involved in social work. 
</P>
<P>
"He has helped many people in his job, and he feels a commitment to the 
country," she said. 
</P>
<P>
She assumes this much: that he is safe at his family home in Kuwait, which is 
serving as a refuge, too, for his father, three brothers, a sister and his 
nephews and nieces. 
</P>
<P>
She doubts he is an insurgent, a member of some underground militia group 
fighting to retake his homeland from the invaders. That is not his style, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a very peaceful person. I know that he won't do something to disturb his 
family's safety. And he's thinking about me and the children." 
</P>
<P>
Presumably, she said, he and his family are lying low in the family home. 
</P>
<P>
Their older sons, 7 and 5, are coping well despite the separation from their 
father, she said. "It's hard for them, but they're happy here," she said. "The 
school has been very supportive. But they still miss him. They talk about him 
all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they don't realize what is going on out there. They don't understand 
the danger he is in. Sometimes they get angry because he hasn't come home to 
them yet. I tell them he has to stay there to care for his father." 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma's memory of leaving her husband three months ago remains as clear as 
the desert sky. 
</P>
<P>
Her final order to her young servant was to the point, punctuated by tears 
streaming down her face: 
</P>
<P>
"I told Ela: 'Don't let my husband see anything that will remind him of me or 
the children. Get rid of my cosmetics, my clothes, the baby cribs, the bottles, 
the diapers, everything. Because I know that if he sees those things, he will 
be very sad.' " 
</P>
<P>
Next, she said goodby to her father-in-law, who gingerly kissed the couple's 
four boys on the forehead. "Now you will go see your other grandfather," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, in the parking lot of a burned-out Safeway grocery store, 
Ledesma gathered with 200 other women and children, about to leave their 
adopted home on an Iraqi passenger jet. 
</P>
<P>
And then she said goodby to her husband. 
</P>
<P>
He was the one insisting that she leave for the United States, and she knew it 
was the best thing to do for herself and the boys, including the twins who were 
born just 12 days earlier as bullets pinged off buildings near the Kuwaiti city 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
But knowing that it was safer in America didn't make it any easier for her to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me to take care of the children. And he said, 'Remember, I love you, 
and my heart will always be with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
She boarded the bus, hot and sticky, and watched her husband drive off in a 
neighbor's Mercedes-Benz. The bus headed for the Kuwaiti airport. 
</P>
<P>
Four days later -- after stops in Baghdad, Yemen, Frankfurt, Nova Scotia and 
Charleston, N.C. -- Ledesma arrived home to her parents in San Diego. They were 
met at the airport by a mariachi band that as much as anything signaled the 
cultural shock of a disrupted life. 
</P>
<P>
Ledesma and her husband had met in San Diego in 1981 at a private school both 
were attending to learn English: she, an 18-year-old, dark-haired Mexican 
student; he, a striking Kuwaiti 11 years her senior. 
</P>
<P>
The couple married a year after they met and spent two years in San Diego 
before he took his bride to his homeland, in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew a very different life lay ahead for me, and I felt I was ready," 
Ledesma said. "But when I got there, I knew I wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
The people. The traditions. The food. The wealth. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't say they (Kuwaitis) were rich, rich, rich, rich, rich -- but they'd 
buy gold by the kilo instead of as jewelry," she said. "They just looked at it 
all differently." 
</P>
<P>
The couple moved into a spacious four-bedroom, four-bath, two-story house that 
featured a formal reception room, living room, den, dining room, television 
room and living quarters for their two servants. The home was luxuriously 
appointed with contemporary Chinese furnishings, looking smart against the 
clean white walls. 
</P>
<P>
"He treated me like a queen," she said of her husband. "He wanted all the best 
things for me." 
</P>
<P>
And so life went: socializing with other couples of mixed marriages, watching 
over the two young boys, and baking, her favorite hobby and one for which she'd 
shoo the servants out of the kitchen. In mid-July, her mother arrived from San 
Diego to spend time with her daughter in the last days of her pregnancy. The 
sonogram already had telegraphed the arrival of twins. 
</P>
<P>
"My sister called from San Diego in late July. She said, 'You know, I never 
watch the news, but they say something is happening in Kuwait.' I told her not 
to worry, that everything was normal. Everything was fine." 
</P>
<P>
The family went out for pepperoni pizza on Wednesday evening, Aug. 1, and 
caught the news on the radio at 10:30 that night. "The announcer said the two 
countries (Kuwait and Iraq) had agreed in a friendly way to be brother 
countries and would fix their differences," Ledesma said. 
</P>
<P>
But by 2 a.m., the invasion was launched "and at 5 in the morning we were 
hearing the booms of guns," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"We hoped it would be over soon. We thought someone would help us -- the United 
States or Egypt or Jordan -- and that it would be over soon." 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. From that morning on, Ledesma became captive in her own home, leaving 
only once -- to give birth to her twins Aug. 26. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of the invasion, the household had grown to 20 members of the 
family and two servants. 
</P>
<P>
She and her house guests kept busy -- playing cards, talking, baking, talking, 
doing housework, talking, and watching videotapes that her mother had brought 
from San Diego -- "Gone With the Wind," "When Harry Met Sally," "Moonstruck" 
and assorted cartoons. 
</P>
<P>
Early on the morning of Aug. 26, she went into labor -- a month sooner than 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30 a.m., she and her husband piled into a Chevrolet Caprice driven by a 
neighbor and sped to the hospital 10 minutes away. They took a route that 
avoided the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked the doctor -- a female, from India -- if it was safe to be there, or 
if I should go elsewhere. She said, 'Oh, no, stay here.' The place was dirty. 
There were no cleaning crews." 
</P>
<P>
Seven hours later, her twins were born, and three hours after that, she went 
home. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to stay there," she said. "I wanted to be home with my husband 
and mother." 
</P>
<P>
For a few days, she said, she forgot about the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
One morning while Ledesma and her mother ate breakfast, they received a call 
from a guardian assigned to them by the American Embassy "asking us if we were 
interested in leaving. He said the Americans were setting up an evacuation of 
women and children. I wanted to leave, for the sake of the children, but I 
didn't want to leave my husband." 
</P>
<P>
Two flights were scheduled -- Sept. 5 and Sept. 7. She chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
The eve of her departure was fitful. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't sleep at all. I was thinking about leaving, and of how my (Kuwaiti) 
sister-in-law, who had children too, couldn't leave like me." 
</P>
<P>
The next morning she dressed and numbly said her goodbys. At 8:45 that Saturday 
morning, Ledesma, her mother and the four boys piled in a neighbor's Mercedes 
and headed for the airport. Her husband and another friend followed in a second 
car. 
</P>
<P>
First they went to the Safeway parking lot, where they crowded onto the buses 
for the final drive to the airport. After a nine-hour delay, the plane took off 
for the 45-minute trip to Baghdad. After a three-hour layover at the airport 
terminal there -- during which time, she said, her baby strollers mysteriously 
disappeared from the plane -- she, her four sons and her mother boarded again, 
for the trip to Yemen. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave us a piece of bread and a glass of 7-Up," she said. "And a dried 
piece of beef." 
</P>
<P>
Today, Ledesma lives with her parents in Chula Vista. They are Mexican citizens 
with U.S. residency permits who own a furniture factory in nearby Tijuana. 
Ledesma herself is a Mexican citizen; her passport is stamped "refugee." 
</P>
<P>
"I never thought," she said, "that a day would come when I would be marked as a 
refugee. 
</P>
<P>
"I think of my husband constantly, wondering when I will get to talk to him, 
see him, smell his sweetness. 
</P>
<P>
"I just wait."

DEATH TOLL CLIMBS TO 19 U.S. SAILORS IN FERRY CAPSIZING

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The death toll rose to 19 and an investigation got under way Saturday after a 
chartered ferry capsized while carrying more than 100 American sailors in the 
Middle East as part of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Survivors said the Israeli ferry Tuvia went under almost instantly in heavy 
seas just after midnight Friday while ferrying crewmen back to the aircraft 
carrier Saratoga from holiday shore leave in the Israeli port of Haifa. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I saw water just come flying in. It was maybe two seconds, 
and the boat rolled right over," said Chief Petty Officer Lance Vickery, 33, of 
Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
Israel and the United States launched investigations, but in a preliminary 
check, Israeli divers said there were no signs of sabotage against the vessel. 
Senior military officials said they were waiting for the Tuvia to be towed to 
shore to complete their investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"It's clear that it's an accident," said Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens. 
"The lives of many were in danger. We did from our side all that was possible 
-- maybe one can say beyond that -- to rescue the lives of the American 
sailors." 
</P>
<P>
Divers retrieved six bodies from the sunken craft in 65 feet of water. The 
other victims were found dead on the surface or died of injuries after being 
picked up, officials said. Three dozen sailors were taken to hospitals, but all 
but six were released by Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
At that time two men were still reported unaccounted for. But U.S. Navy 
officials said they believed they would be located as all 1,920 crewmen who 
began liberty Friday returned, under orders, to the carrier and its three 
escort ships. 
</P>
<P>
The 16,000-ton Saratoga and its escorts were on leave in the Mediterranean Sea. 
The ships had been deployed in the Red Sea in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion 
of Kuwait on Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Several sailors rescued from the Tuvia said the craft may have been overloaded. 
One of the two Israeli crewmen said he believed too many sailors were crowded 
into the ferry's stern. 
</P>
<P>
But Maj. Gen. Micha Ram, the commander of Israel's navy, said on Israel radio 
that the Tuvia had been licensed to carry 130 passengers but took only about 
100 because the seas were running high. 
</P>
<P>
"Until the boat is retrieved and can be examined . . . we cannot point to any 
negligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ram said the craft went down in 15 or 20 seconds, adding: "I have never known a 
vessel to sink so fast." 
</P>
<P>
The 57-foot-long, double-deck ferry capsized about 200 yards from the Saratoga, 
which was anchored outside the harbor's breakwater about a mile offshore. The 
waves were reported at three to four feet and winds at 35 m.p.h. when the craft 
keeled over. 
</P>
<P>
Late Saturday the Navy released the names of 14 of those killed; the remaining 
five were withheld pending the notification of relatives. The 14 were: 
</P>
<P>

POLICE CREDIBILITY ON TRIAL AFTER SUSPECT O.C. CASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN WEIKEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dist. Atty. Investigator Robert Davis testified that on the day Aissa Wayne and 
her boyfriend were attacked, Wayne's ex-husband, Dr. Thomas Gionis, was in his 
limousine when calls from a private detective who set up the assault came in on 
the car phone. He was sure about that key piece of evidence, he said, because 
Gionis' chauffeur had told him so. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Davis fell into the maw. Defense attorney John D. Barnett confronted him 
with a tape recording of his conversation with the chauffeur. No statement 
placing Gionis in the limo was on the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Davis squirmed in his seat. Gionis winked at the defense staff. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the jury deadlocked 9 to 3 to convict and the holdout jurors said 
they thought Davis was not truthful on the stand. 
</P>
<P>
The devastating cross-examination in the Gionis case is not an isolated example 
of a law enforcement officer being impaled on his or her own words by a skilled 
defense attorney. Police have been there before. 
</P>
<P>
Blame it on overwork, honest mistakes, lapse of memory or just plain lying, the 
credibility of Orange County law enforcement officers and the quality of their 
investigations have been called into question in a number of local cases, 
including some high-profile ones. 
</P>
<P>
Although the vast majority of police are honest and professional, serious 
errors and inaccurate statements going to the heart of guilt or innocence have 
occurred in cases ranging from the simple writing of traffic tickets to major 
felony matters and civil lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
"We see it a fair amount of times," said Jack Earley, a longtime Orange County 
lawyer and spokesman for California Attorneys for Criminal Justice, a statewide 
association of defense counsel. "In the perfect system, police should gather 
evidence without necessarily assuming guilt or innocence, but our justice 
system has not evolved that way." 
</P>
<P>
"It's the one thing we really have to protect against," said Laguna Beach 
Police Chief Neil J. Purcell, president of the Orange County Chiefs' and 
Sheriff's Assn. "We must assure the public and the judicial system that our 
integrity and honesty is unquestionable. No defendant is worth an officer lying 
or stretching the truth. . . . Like Jack Webb says, 'Just the facts, ma'am.' " 
</P>
<P>
Five days a week, in scores of courtrooms across the county, the accuracy of 
police officers is routinely challenged by defense lawyers, scrutinized by 
judges and weighed by jurors. 
</P>
<P>
Their work holds up in most cases, but in some it does not, and the mistakes 
are costly considering the power that police officers have over the average 
person. Those charged with crimes based on inaccurate statements or shoddy 
investigation must fight the stigma of arrest and endure financial hardship 
until they are either acquitted or the matter is dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
In civil cases, plaintiffs alleging police misconduct have been removed from 
lawsuits because of erroneous statements by law enforcement officials. That 
happened to George Wright, a Rancho Santiago College instructor, who alleged in 
a federal civil rights suit in the mid-1980s that Orange County Sheriff Brad 
Gates improperly investigated him because he was a political opponent. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and two deputies said in sworn court affidavits that they never ordered 
or participated in the surveillance of Wright and other department critics. 
Partly based on those statements, Wright was thrown out as a plaintiff. 
</P>
<P>
When evidence to the contrary later surfaced, Gates and the deputies recanted 
their statements in sworn depositions and in court in 1988. Federal authorities 
investigated for the possibility of perjury. No charges resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bonehead mistake," said Sheriff's Lt. Randall Blair, who was linked 
to the surveillance of Wright and a newspaper reporter. Gates said he honestly 
believed there had been no investigation and blamed the error on inaccurate 
information from subordinates. 
</P>
<P>
Said Wright: "I had a considerable amount of money invested in that lawsuit 
when I was kicked out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Wright did not rejoin the lawsuit, but complained to the FBI. The other 
plaintiffs, including a former Orange County Municipal Court judge, settled the 
case for $375,000, a portion of which they gave to Wright even though he had 
been dismissed from the suit. 
</P>
<P>
Similar inaccuracies have affected other cases: 
</P>
<P>
* In a traffic matter handled by defense lawyer Ronald Brower, police said 
there was a stop sign where there wasn't and the officer's report said the 
streets formed an intersection when they actually ran parallel. 
</P>
<P>
* In two recent felony cases, police ignored fingerprints that would have 
exonerated the accused well before the cases were filed, according to the 
county public defender's office. One case was dismissed; the other ended in 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
* In another major felony prosecution, an Anaheim officer whose gunfire wounded 
a baby earlier this year said in sworn testimony that the suspect had pointed a 
gun at him twice. Three witnesses, including the child's mother and an observer 
in a police helicopter, said they did not see a gun pointed at the officer 
before he fired. A charge of assault on a police officer was dismissed as a 
result, and a judge made a finding that the officer was not believable in this 
case. 
</P>
<P>
* The Sheriff's Department faces allegations that a deputy and other county 
personnel deliberately destroyed a key section of County Jail videotape that 
purportedly would have shown deputies beating an inmate without provocation. 
The tape, which was cut and crudely spliced back together, was evidence in a 
federal civil rights suit. The county has claimed that a malfunctioning 
videocassette player accidentally damaged the recording. 
</P>
<P>
No statistics are available on how many times law enforcement officers have 
embellished testimony, misstated the facts or lied to help make a case. But 
prosecutors, judges and defense lawyers say credibility problems involving 
police are not all that uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
"It was one of the constant battles I had with police and investigators," said 
Nick Novick, a retired prosecutor who headed the district attorney's branch 
office in south Orange County. "Like in any other business, most are pros, and 
most cops are ethical and straightforward, but you have those who try it." 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, hundreds of misdemeanor prosecutions and scores of 
felony cases are dismissed every month in Orange County courts for a variety of 
reasons. A number of those, defense lawyers say, are kicked out because of poor 
investigation or credibility problems. 
</P>
<P>
Proven cases of fabrication of key evidence remain rare and in the last decade, 
there have been a handful of investigations into whether an Orange County law 
enforcement officer committed perjury. 
</P>
<P>
Local prosecutors only recall one case in which an officer was convicted of 
perjury and fabricating evidence -- a Buena Park police sergeant who falsely 
linked people to crimes by saying their fingerprints were found at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
More common are embellishment, exaggeration, stretching the facts and shoddy 
investigation. Judges, police and attorneys blame some of this on human error, 
overwork, inevitable memory lapses and pressures to make a case that can affect 
an officer's objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
"A police officer on the street reacts instantly. They may fully believe in 
their mind that a gun was pointed at them when it wasn't," said North Municipal 
Court Judge Margaret Anderson, who handles felony preliminary hearings. "You 
can sincerely and honestly believe something happens to you, but your 
perception is wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Police say some investigators and officers are incredibly busy, handling many 
cases at a time. Often, they come to court to testify months after a case has 
begun and are asked by the defense to accurately produce details about the 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
But criminal defense attorneys blame some of the inaccuracies on incompetence 
and something else -- a presumption that a person is guilty from the start, 
which can improperly influence the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Police manuals say they must accumulate all evidence and not try to point the 
finger at someone too soon," said Ron Talmo, a civil rights attorney and 
assistant dean at Western State University College of Law based in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
"But if you drive down the street and you're weaving, is the cop going to ask 
you if you had a sneezing attack? If he sees certain symptoms -- watery eyes, 
slurred speech -- is he or she going to ask if you have palsy or anything else? 
No, because none of that helps the cops." 
</P>
<P>
One of the most serious controversies involving the truthfulness of police 
occurred in 1985 after Newport Beach officers boarded and commandeered the Sea 
Dolphin, a 45-foot ketch loaded with six tons of marijuana. It was the largest 
pot seizure in the city's history. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they had enough cause to search the sailboat because there was a 
marked 20-minute mooring restriction that was violated and the boat was riding 
low in the water. One officer said a deckhand blurted out, "Search and you'll 
find 20,000 pounds of pot" when police stepped onto the boat. 
</P>
<P>
Court testimony indicated, however, that the mooring sign was faded and partly 
obliterated, making it difficult for anyone -- police or boaters -- to find out 
whether there was a mooring limit. Case records show that doubt was cast on 
whether the deckhand made such an obviously incriminating remark because it had 
not been mentioned in police reports or officials' reasons for seeking a search 
warrant. 
</P>
<P>
To make matters worse, a few hours after Harbor Municipal Court Judge Russell 
A. Bostrom ordered the faded sign to be photographed for the case, it was 
repainted by Newport Beach city employees before the order could be carried 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Bostrom subsequently ruled that the police made an illegal search and threw out 
the case. He also held one detective in contempt for making contradictory 
statements on key parts of the case and criticized other officers in the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly prima facie cases of perjury could be alleged against two and possibly 
all three of the officers as well as possible charges of conspiracy to obstruct 
justice and the willful destruction of evidence," Bostrom said in court. 
</P>
<P>
The bitterly contested dismissal was upheld on appeal and the last of the case 
was kicked out two years ago. Appellate justices concluded that the police 
search made "a mockery" of the Constitution, while police said the case was 
kicked out over a "technicality." 
</P>
<P>
Court records show that Municipal Court Judge Christopher Strople overturned 
the detective's contempt citation and referred misconduct allegations to the 
Orange County Grand Jury. No perjury charges resulted. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't have a tape or a photograph, it is hard to overcome this kind of 
thing in the system," said Brower, a former deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Although obviously inaccurate statements have been made in cases, prosecutors 
also say that perjury or lying under oath is hard to show and certain legal 
requirements must be met before charges can be filed. 
</P>
<P>
"It requires two witnesses or one witness plus sufficient corroboration. You 
get into a lot of technicalities and it is one of the more difficult crimes to 
prosecute," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Wallace J. Wade, head of the district 
attorney's special operations unit, which looks into allegations of misconduct 
by public officials. 
</P>
<P>
The district attorney's office declined to discuss Investigator Davis' 
performance on the witness stand in the Gionis case. 
</P>
<P>
But Davis' testimony "is a shock" to Newport Beach Chief Purcell. "It raises 
some real concerns with chiefs and those who might have read about it," Purcell 
said. "I would expect officers to have good recall and memory of key phone 
calls." 
</P>
<P>
Central to the prosecution's case were telephone records showing a pattern of 
calls between Gionis, a private detective and two gunmen who attacked Wayne 
during a bitter child-custody dispute. 
</P>
<P>
Davis' testimony placed Gionis in the limo when calls came in from one of the 
alleged henchmen hours before the attack. After the tape contradicted Davis, 
Davis said Gionis must have made another phone call to talk to the chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
The defense put on unrefuted evidence of Gionis' whereabouts, showing that he 
was not in the limo the morning before the assault. There was no record of a 
second phone call by Davis to the chauffeur. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Davis sat right here. You heard him. Fourteen years of law enforcement. 
Member of the organized crime unit," Barnett told jurors in his closing 
argument. "Why did (the prosecutor) ask him those questions? Because he wanted 
to impress you. Those are impressive credentials. . . . But you know that Mr. 
Davis is lying. Because we proved it. But folks, if you hadn't heard that tape, 
you would never have known." 
</P>
<P>
When serious questions about an officer's honesty arise, they can be 
investigated internally by the law enforcement agency or weeded out of cases 
before they become a problem. Sometimes it means dismissing cases or dropping 
charges to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have a legal obligation to rid their cases of potential 
inaccuracies damaging to a case and must disclose to the defense evidence that 
might relate to the believability of witnesses and the police. 
</P>
<P>
"We have people trying to resolve these things on our side of the fence before 
charges are filed," said Chief Assistant Dist. Atty. Maury Evans. "If we find 
something out after that, we try to resolve them before trial." 
</P>
<P>
Earley, the spokesman for the defense counsel association, said, for example, 
that in one death penalty case a map he thought could help corroborate the 
alibi of the murder defendant was placed in a Garden Grove detective's desk and 
apparently forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
The accused, Son Van Ngo, a bodyguard, claimed that he shot several associates 
who threatened his life for refusing to participate in a home-invasion robbery. 
He said a map to the home was made by one of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
During jury selection, Earley said, another police officer found the map, which 
was then turned over to the defense by the prosecution. Ngo was convicted of 
voluntary manslaughter and spared the death penalty.

WAR IS A PAINFUL MEMORY FOR RELEASED IRAQI SOLDIER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<DATELINE>
<P>
BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former combat tank driver seemed out of place selling bras and panties in 
an indoor bazaar. 
</P>
<P>
He was slightly more drawn than when he left for war six years ago, friends 
said, but he was still brawny enough to haul big sacks of clothing as if they 
were weightless, and his thick hands made the flimsy wares he sold look like 
dolls' clothing. 
</P>
<P>
He was content, he said, haggling over prices with his customers and patiently 
tugging at elastic bands to show off the quality. 
</P>
<P>
"After prison in Iran, this is a kind of peace," he told a visitor. "I am as 
happy as can be." 
</P>
<P>
Ali -- not his real name -- came home to Baghdad in mid-August, a freed 
prisoner of war. After Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the government of Saddam 
Hussein made a quick peace with its archenemy Iran and brought to a full close 
an eight-year war that had been suspended by a cease-fire in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
The peace -- Iraq withdrew from Iranian territory it had fought long and hard 
to hold -- made it possible for Hussein to reduce the military threat from the 
east and concentrate his forces on the defense of annexed Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
An exchange of thousands of prisoners from each side was part of the deal, and 
the homecomings have brought joy in hard times to families throughout Iraq. But 
in a perverse way, the return of haggard men from war is also a reminder of the 
pain of the long conflict and a caution about the future. 
</P>
<P>
The subject is apparently sensitive enough that no account of life in captivity 
from a returning POW has been published in Iraqi newspapers or broadcast on the 
airwaves. Iraqis appear to be tired of war. Even as many express agreement that 
Kuwait is part of Iraq, visions of more dead, more wounded and more captured 
only two years after the conclusion of the Iran-Iraq bloodshed has tempered 
enthusiasm for the new conquest. 
</P>
<P>
It is a dangerous issue to bring up, especially in a crowded market where ears 
are tuned not only to pick up the chant of bargain prices but also the murmur 
of dissenting voices. "I have seen many things," said Ali as he was pressed for 
an opinion on the wisdom of fighting for Kuwait. "Lots of things." 
</P>
<P>
Ali was captured in 1986 during the bloody struggle over Al Faw, an Iraqi port 
on a spit of land at the mouth of the Shatt al Arab, the confluence of Iraq's 
main rivers at the head of the Persian Gulf. For 42 days, Iran poured artillery 
fire onto the town, ravaged the marshy landscape, eventually crossed the river 
and took the devastated peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq would recapture it two years later. From 1980 to 1988, more than 50,000 
Iraqis and 120,000 Iranians died in the battles over Al Faw, the Iraqi 
government says. In official parlance, Al Faw is now called the City of 
Sacrifice and Gateway for Great Victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I was surrounded," Ali tersely recalled his capture under fire. "We had to 
surrender." 
</P>
<P>
His capture began a difficult odyssey. He spent two weeks on a truck crammed 
with other prisoners traversing the rough terrain of Iran before being taken to 
a prisoner of war camp called El Khark. Later he was transferred to a camp 
called El Haswatiyah, and finally to a stockade in Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
In detention, he was sometimes jammed into a room with 20 prisoners, sometimes 
only four. Bread was the mainstay of the diet, and meat was served three or 
four times a week. Letters from home came infrequently, sometimes months, even 
a year, after they were sent. 
</P>
<P>
"I prayed a lot," Ali said as he held up a pink Slim Line panty for a veiled 
customer. "Praying is one thing we were allowed to do." 
</P>
<P>
Ali is a devout Shiite Muslim, and Shiite-ruled Iran pinned part of its hopes 
of defeating Iraq on getting enemy Shiites to rebel against the secular rule of 
Hussein. In prison, Iranian wardens preached the virtues of the late Ayatollah 
Ruhollah Khomeini and handed out literature extolling his rule and desire for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he wanted peace so much," Ali remarked dryly. 
</P>
<P>
The pro-Khomeini lectures were complemented by anti-Hussein harangues. A 
prisoner who declared himself opposed to the Baghdad regime would be given more 
reading materials and favors, such as occasional excursions outside the prison 
walls. 
</P>
<P>
Intrigue blackened the atmosphere. Guards asked prisoners to inform on their 
comrades: Who was pro-Hussein, who not? Little bits of information might be 
rewarded by the sudden arrival of a letter from home or trips to a mosque or, 
for Christians, to a church. 
</P>
<P>
Visits from the Red Cross or the Red Crescent Society, the Islamic relief 
organization, were times of intense if hypocritical activity. New bed coverings 
were brought in and rations were increased. Prisoners were ordered to clean 
their cells. When the visitors left, the old, ragged blankets were returned. 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally an Iranian official would come to inspect, and the clean-up chores 
began again. "If we didn't make things spotless, the guards would beat us," Ali 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Labor -- tasks like weaving rugs or construction and repair of buildings -- was 
encouraged. The pay was minimal, enough to buy a pack of cigarettes or soap. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone aged rapidly. Ali lost seven front teeth and began to walk with a 
stoop though he was not yet 30 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Then, in early August, word came over the prison radio that Iran and Iraq had 
made peace. Iran trumpeted a great victory; Iraqi troops were pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
Ali was among the first to be bused to the border and then into Iraq, to 
Baghdad, where each night on television the freed prisoners were shown stepping 
into the sunlight, sometimes raising a clenched fist, but more often 
impassively carrying a little bag of belongings as they rushed off screen past 
a large portrait of Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
Ali, now 31, was greeted by relatives with a modest feast of lamb and rice and 
a gift of false teeth. He has fattened up quite a bit since returning home and 
now walks erect. 
</P>
<P>
A cousin set him up in the underwear business and he rented space in the 
bazaar. From the government, he gets 97 Iraqi dinars a month pension; by the 
official exchange rate, that is almost $300, but on the black market, it is 
less than $20. Rental for a small apartment is about 200 dinars. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, I work like everyone else," said Ali. The family arranged an engagement 
to a young woman of 21, a distant relative in his large clan. Perhaps in four 
months, they will be married. 
</P>
<P>
The other day, as Ali delicately arranged a display of mascara and face cream, 
new items for sale at his stall, word filtered from the street near the mosque 
that a military bus had pulled into the square. Army police wearing red berets 
were checking the papers of male passers-by to see if they were evading the 
draft. The government had just announced a quick call-up of 33-year-olds, 
extending by a year the liability for military service. 
</P>
<P>
"War is not good," Ali remarked suddenly. A woman fingering stockings nodded 
slowly and her two children looked up attentively. 
</P>
<P>
"My brother-in-law is still in prison in Iran. He was captured at Nahr Jassem. 
At least a friend of his told us. This friend was shot in the head, but he can 
still speak," he said. The woman held a pair of black panty hose in front of 
her face for close inspection. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, every night, my family looks at the television to see if my 
brother-in-law has come back," Ali continued. 
</P>
<P>
"I have seen many things. I have seen men killed in front of me. My cousin was 
killed in Al Faw." The woman lost interest in the hose, clutched her two 
children and trundled them down the arcade. 
</P>
<P>
"Lots of things. I have stepped on the bodies of dead Iranians, there were so 
many of them. I'll never forget that," Ali concluded quietly. 
</P>
<P>
Outside the arcade, a few young men were ushered on board the military bus, 
settling rigidly into seats behind smoked glass. They had a confused look; some 
carried plastic shopping bags and seemed to have been intercepted while buying 
bread. The red berets stood by the bus door, clapping their nightsticks into 
the palms of their hands and scanning the crowds for likely faces. 
</P>
<P>
Ali eyed the scene impassively as he stuffed the panty hose back into its 
plastic wrapper and noted that the bus that brought him to Baghdad from the 
Iranian border was like the one outside the arcade, only older.

NEW MOTHER CONFIRMS SHE WAS GIVEN WRONG BABY; 
</P>
<P>
MIX-UP: WOMAN BLASTS SANTA ANA HOSPITAL FOR NOT ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IT MADE A 
MISTAKE.

COSTA MESA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A distraught new mother confirmed Saturday that Western Medical Center-Santa 
Ana had sent her home with the wrong newborn baby, and blasted the hospital for 
refusing to publicly acknowledge and apologize for the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The woman and her husband, who asked not to be identified, sat in their Costa 
Mesa dining room Saturday explaining the mix-up while their newly reclaimed 
week-old son snoozed on his grandmother's shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I have my son, and I thank God I have my son, I still see that 
other baby's face," the woman said tearfully. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokesman John M. Boop said Saturday that the hospital had respected 
both couples' requests for anonymity when news of the mix-up surfaced last 
week. Boop said it would be "terribly inappropriate" to confirm or deny any 
mix-up, which is part of the patients' confidential medical records. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa mother said she was handed the wrong baby in the hospital hours 
after the birth, and had no idea the baby boy was not her son until a day after 
she took the newborn home, when she noticed that his wristband bore another 
mother's name. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very traumatic experience," she said. "I was hysterical." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital eventually located the other child, whose parents were equally 
startled, and both couples were informed that their babies had probably been 
switched, the woman said. But it took several days of testing before the 
couples were sure they had the right babies, she said. "They were just as torn 
up as we were," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said she gave birth to an 8-pound, 3-ounce boy at 3:04 a.m. Dec. 15. 
About 6 a.m., she said, she was handed a baby boy that looked remarkably like 
her own son. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't tell because I had been in labor and I was tired, and he had a 
little hat on. . . ," she said. "I had no idea it wasn't mine." 
</P>
<P>
From that point on, she said, "I had the baby in the room with me." 
</P>
<P>
The mother and baby were sent home from the hospital about noon on Dec. 16, the 
couple said. That night, "I went to put the baby in his pajamas, and the 
wristband just slipped right off, and I just set it aside," she said. "I didn't 
think about it because you never think it's the wrong baby." 
</P>
<P>
But on Monday, she found the wristband, noticed that it bore another woman's 
name, and called the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, they said that it was a typographical error," she said. Eventually, 
however, the hospital sent a representative to the home of the other set of 
parents, and found that they had been sent home with a 8-pound, 2-ounce baby 
boy who looked almost identical -- but also had the wrong name on his 
wristband. 
</P>
<P>
The Costa Mesa couple believe that the mix-up occurred because the babies, who 
are initially tagged with bands on both their wrists and ankles, were each 
tagged with one name on the wrist and another on the ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"When they released me, they checked the leg, which matched my number, but the 
wrist did not," the mother said. 
</P>
<P>
When they arrived at the hospital about 7 p.m. Monday, they were told that the 
babies had probably been switched, but that blood tests would be needed to 
confirm which baby was which, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked. I didn't believe it. I insisted that that was my baby," she 
said. "My God, I took care of it in the hospital. I stayed up all night with 
the baby, and I was convinced it was my child." 
</P>
<P>
That night, the hospital conducted routine blood tests, but the couples' blood 
types were too similar to make a conclusive match, the baby's father said. The 
women were readmitted and spent the next two nights at the hospital while more 
extensive tests were being taken, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two babies were put in a single nursery, so that both mothers 
could get acquainted with both babies, the couple said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a hard time getting to know him," the mother said, pointing to her true 
son. "I couldn't convince myself to hold him because I wasn't convinced that he 
was mine." 
</P>
<P>
By Wednesday, the couples were informed that the babies had indeed been 
switched. But then the Costa Mesa couple's baby developed jaundice, and was 
kept in the hospital until Friday, when he was well enough to come home, the 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
The couples also requested DNA analysis to confirm the blood tests and expect 
the results in about two weeks, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman urged other mothers to check their babies' wrist and ankle bands 
before leaving the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"Just don't depend on the hospital being right, because I took it for granted," 
she said. "I want to make sure mothers know that there are mistakes made. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"When you first get a baby and you begin bonding in that way, then it's very 
hard to let go," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman said her 10-year-old son, who doesn't look much like her, is now 
afraid that perhaps he, too, might have been mixed up at birth. 
</P>
<P>
"He took right to the baby and all of a sudden the baby has to leave us," the 
woman said. "And now he says, 'See, Mom, what if I was switched?' And now I'm 
very concerned." 
</P>
<P>
The couple, who had their attorney with them during the interview, said they 
had asked the hospital for anonymity. "I was devastated enough, and I didn't 
want to have to answer questions," she said. 
</P>
<P>
But she and her husband said they were distressed to read in the newspapers 
statements by hospital officials that they thought left the false impression 
that there had never been a mix-up. They said they telephoned the hospital 
Saturday to ask that administrators contact the media to set the record 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
"It made me angry, because it made me sound like I was just a hysterical 
parent. . . ," the woman said. "It made them sound like they're in the right." 
</P>
<P>
After news stories appeared, the woman said: "A lot of people called me and 
said, 'Well, why did you think that wasn't your baby? And I said, 'But it 
wasn't my baby!' " 
</P>
<P>
"If you're going to put it in the paper, tell the truth," the baby's father 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Boop, vice president of community relations for the hospital, said Saturday 
that he did not imply that there was no mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
"I did not comment on that, because that is part of the medical record. . . ," 
Boop said. "That medical record is in a sense a precious legal document and it 
has the rights of the patients and the rights of the doctor involved. . . . It 
would be terribly inappropriate for me to comment on that, and I shouldn't, and 
I won't." 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Lincer, Orange County district administrator for the state 
Department of Health Services' Facilities Licensing and Certification Division, 
said Friday that the allegation about the baby mix-up at Western Medical 
Center-Santa Ana is under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
"We will be looking to see if the facilities have very specific policies and 
procedures on how newborns are tagged and looking to see if they followed the 
policies and procedures," Lincer said.

SCHOOL'S OUT . . . FOREVER;

<P>
EDUCATION: DIPPING ENROLLMENT, RECESSION FORCE IDYLLWILD CAMPUS TO CLOSE AFTER 
60 YEARS.

IDYLLWILD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 60 years the Elliott-Pope Preparatory School has educated children of the 
famous and wealthy, turning often unmotivated teen-agers into college-bound 
graduates with its formula of rigorous academics, live-in faculty and 
wilderness study programs. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled beneath a canopy of pines and oaks outside Idyllwild, the school has 
cultivated the children of Frank Sinatra and Art Linkletter as well as the 
offspring of many American corporate captains and foreign magnates. 
</P>
<P>
Its long history and celebrated alumni, however, have not been enough to save 
Elliott-Pope from two formidable predators -- declining enrollment and the 
recession. Financially crippled, the coeducational school will close its doors 
for good Dec. 31, leaving 135 students -- most of them boarders -- stranded in 
the middle of their academic year. 
</P>
<P>
David Goodsell, who took over as headmaster at Elliott-Pope in July, calls the 
school's demise a "tragedy" caused by a confluence of unfortunate events. 
</P>
<P>
Dipping enrollment was the chief culprit. Budgeted for 140 boarding students, 
the school instead got just 105 this year. With annual tuition for live-in 
pupils at $16,800, that shortfall caused a significant jolt. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, economic jitters prompted the school's bank to recall the line of 
credit that had served for years as a financial cushion for Elliott-Pope. 
</P>
<P>
And in the end, when administrators and parents mounted a last-ditch campaign 
for $700,000 in donations to rescue the school, they found the fund-raising 
spigot shut tight. Other rescue efforts -- including an offer to sell to a 
neighboring private school -- also failed. 
</P>
<P>
"This recession that nobody wants to call a recession is to blame," Goodsell 
said. "We found that people who had given substantially in the past just 
weren't willing or able to this year. . . . There was no choice but to close." 
</P>
<P>
The news struck the tranquil Elliott-Pope community like a thunderclap. Staff 
and faculty -- several of whom had taught at the school for 30 years -- 
seesawed from disbelief to despair over having to leave the San Jacinto 
Mountains and hunt for work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Within the close-knit student population there was trauma, anxiety and many 
tears. 
</P>
<P>
"It was weird, but everybody just got real upset. People just wept," said 
Joshua Kintz, 16, a day student who had attended Elliott-Pope on a scholarship 
for five years. "You formed really close relationships there and it's hard to 
just yank away from all that at the drop of a dime." 
</P>
<P>
Kintz, like several of his classmates, said the chief attraction of 
Elliott-Pope was its philosophy of allowing students considerable flexibility 
so long as they kept up their grades. 
</P>
<P>
"They gave you freedom; it was like they respected you," said Kintz, whose 
14-year-old sister, Tara, also attended the school. "I actually looked forward 
to going to school, and that's pretty weird." 
</P>
<P>
Students also praised the 41 faculty and staff members; all were called by 
their first names, and more than half lived on campus and maintained a 
perpetual "open-door" policy. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't like teachers, but more like people we could trust," Kintz said. 
</P>
<P>
Scattered across 89 wooded acres on the edge of the San Bernardino National 
Forest, Elliott-Pope has the look of a vacation resort. Students lived in 
attractive tan-and-brown dormitories, and the dining hall was an old hunting 
lodge with a wood-beamed ceiling, wrap-around porch and two massive stone 
fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
The campus boasted an 18,000-volume library, modern gymnasium, equestrian 
center, swimming pool, rock climbing course and tennis courts. Aside from 
classroom instruction, students enjoyed "experimental learning" on frequent 
excursions throughout the West. 
</P>
<P>
Goodsell, who had no idea of the school's financial woes when he signed on as 
headmaster last summer, believes Elliott-Pope is only the first private, 
nonprofit school to be done in by declining enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
The nation is "in the bottom of a demographic trough for high-school-aged 
students right now," he said. "We may be first to go under, but I'm sure we 
won't be the last." 
</P>
<P>
Margaret Goldsborough, a spokeswoman for the National Assn. of Independent 
Schools in Washington, confirmed that "the trough is real," noting that the 
association's member schools experienced a 4.9% decline in 12th-grade 
enrollment between 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"That makes it very hard on schools that are small and focus on the upper 
grades," Goldsborough said. No other schools have closed this year, she said, 
but there have been several mergers and one friendly takeover. 
</P>
<P>
In California, however, Elliott-Pope's experience appears to be unique. Mimi 
Baer, executive director of the California Assn. of Independent Schools, said 
nearly all of the association's 124 member schools have "long waiting lists and 
are doing just fine." 
</P>
<P>
Baer said most schools have an active board of trustees that prepares a 
long-range plan and develops reserves to guard against financial calamities. 
"It's possible," she said, that such a foundation was missing at Elliott-Pope. 
</P>
<P>
Goodsell declined to comment on the management of the school before his 
arrival. But he did concede that marketing, fund raising and long-range 
planning were "not what they should have been. We had big plans to rectify that 
this year. Obviously, it was too late." 
</P>
<P>
With final exams now over, most of the students have departed. Many of the 
boarders have been accepted by other private schools, where they will finish 
out the year. But the 30 students whose families live in Idyllwild face the 
prospect of a 45-minute bus ride down the mountain to the closest public high 
school, in Hemet. 
</P>
<P>
Back at Elliott-Pope, the stable manager is struggling to sell the school's 
herd of horses and the biology teacher is seeking homes for the snakes and 
other creatures in his laboratory. The trustees, meanwhile, are looking for a 
good real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
In the main lodge, the fireplaces are cold and signs of the life that once 
flourished there are dwindling. A few backpacks and algebra books are scattered 
about, and the minutes of the Oct. 1 student council meeting remain posted on 
the bulletin board. 
</P>
<P>
From her office in a corner of the lodge, receptionist and dormitory mother 
Paula Fredericks surveys the scene and reflects on the last few months. 
</P>
<P>
"People think of boarding schools as places where rich people dump their kids, 
but this place was different. We were all like family," Fredericks says. 
"Saying goodby to those kids, it was like death, like getting divorced 140 
times."

WALESA IS SWORN IN, PLEDGES TO PRESS REFORMS

<TEXT>
<P>
Lech Walesa was sworn in Saturday as president of Poland, capping a decade-long 
struggle by the Solidarity movement, under his leadership, to drive the 
Communists from power. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, 47, immediately establishing a tone of presidential confidence, pledged 
to press on with Poland's economic reforms, promising to continue 
decentralization so that "as many decisions as possible are made at the grass 
roots." 
</P>
<P>
In a move that is certain to please Poland's international creditors and 
economic advisers, Walesa also pledged to continue a "modified version" of the 
economic reforms launched by Deputy Prime Minister Leszek Balcerowicz, widely 
credited for moving Poland far ahead of its East European neighbors, all 
struggling to overcome 45 years of Communist central planning. 
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremonies were held before a packed session of Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuously absent was the outgoing president, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, a 
former Communist Party leader whose declaration of martial law in 1981 cracked 
down on Solidarity and resulted in a yearlong detention for Walesa. Jaruzelski 
was not invited to the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa, a former shipyard electrician born of peasants and educated in a trade 
school for mechanics, wore a formal blue suit for the occasion and, as always, 
wore a pin of the Black Madonna of Czestochowa, a holy symbol, on his lapel. 
His wife, Danuta, the mother of their eight children, stood at his side. He 
reminded Poles that he is the first directly elected president in the country's 
history. 
</P>
<P>
"The evil era when the authorities of our country were appointed under pressure 
of foreigners or as the result of forced compromises is ending," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Today we are making a significant step on a long and bloody road to 
reconstruction of our independence." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa offered what could be taken as a brief sketch of his foreign policy 
horizons, noting historical connections with Poland's neighbors, pointedly 
omitting any direct reference to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"Independent Poland wants to be an element of the peaceful order in Europe. It 
wants to be a good neighbor. Centuries of mutual history link us with the 
Ukraine, Byelorussia and Lithuania. This applies also to Germany, in which we 
want to see a friendly gate to Europe. Being culturally connected with the 
West, we simultaneously want to build a spirit of sympathy and cooperation in 
our relations with Russia. But we are aware that only a reformed and 
economically strong Poland will be an equal partner for others." 
</P>
<P>
About a third of the new president's brief inaugural address dealt with 
economic issues, which were key in his campaign for the presidency against 
defeated Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, who watched the proceedings from 
the Parliament gallery. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa's campaign criticism of Mazowiecki seemed at times to cut in two 
directions at once, as Walesa argued that reforms were too harsh to ordinary 
working Poles but that the changes were also moving too slowly. 
</P>
<P>
In the days since his election, however, he has appeared committed to speeding 
up change, a theme that ran strongly through his speech Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"Poland has achieved much" during its year under Mazowiecki, he said. "Today, 
the nation expects from us even more -- it expects changes in economic policy 
and the manner of ruling. The attitude of millions of voters was unequivocal 
about that. Our reforms must unfold more quickly and more skillfully. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Universal privatization is an equally huge task. Poland should become a nation 
of owners. Everyone can and should become an owner of a part of the nation's 
property, part of our homeland. This is the simplest, time-tested road to 
responsibility. Only in this way can we multiply our prosperity and teach 
ourselves economy." 
</P>
<P>
Walesa has delayed choosing a prime minister until after the holidays and has 
run into problems finding a leader for a government that might serve only until 
parliamentary elections, scheduled for the spring. Some potential candidates 
withdrew when told that Balcerowicz would continue to hold sweeping authority 
over economic matters. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders now say that Balcerowicz himself is Walesa's leading candidate to 
become the prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Walesa is still considering whether to postpone the parliamentary elections for 
a year -- to give a new government time to establish itself -- or to go forward 
with the elections as scheduled.

COUP BID THWARTED IN PHILIPPINES;

<TEXT>
<P>
When Philippine President Corazon Aquino named a new armed forces chief of 
staff in a brass-and-bugles ceremony Friday, she boasted to the assembled 
soldiers and diplomats that the collapse of seven attempted right-wing military 
coups since 1986 "shows the strength of our democracy." 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, her newly designated military chief, Maj. Gen. Rodolfo Biazon, was 
able to boast that he had foiled yet another coup attempt, perhaps the 
strangest yet. 
</P>
<P>
Biazon said that four men drove into a major Philippine air base north of 
Manila on Friday night with a pot of barbiturate-laced goat stew and 26 bundled 
sticks of dynamite wrapped as Christmas presents. Their plan, he said, was to 
drug the troops at a party, steal their V-150 armored personnel carrier, and 
blow up the aircraft and 810,000 gallons of jet fuel stored at the base. 
</P>
<P>
Thanks to a tip, the air force had flown all six F-5A jets out of Basa Air Base 
and had special troops on the lookout. The four men, including a renegade army 
captain convicted in absentia Wednesday with 80 others for a failed 1987 coup, 
were captured. Two other carloads of mutineers, parked outside the base, 
escaped. 
</P>
<P>
"This was supposed to be a signal for another coup attempt," Biazon said at a 
news conference. But he said that no other rebel troop movements had been noted 
and that no coup was likely to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
"Considering that there was a party, with children and women, it could have led 
to a massacre of innocent civilians," he added. 
</P>
<P>
It was an auspicious start for a controversial general whose main qualification 
as military chief, according to his many critics, is his loyalty to Aquino's 
ever-threatened government. He played a key role in crushing last December's 
coup attempt, which left at least 113 people dead. 
</P>
<P>
Aquino said that Biazon, 55, would serve only until he reaches retirement age 
next April. It was a face-saving measure, designed to thank Biazon but not to 
further divide the already fragmented armed forces. His replacement in April 
will be a less controversial figure. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very Philippine solution," said one brigadier general, who, like many 
of his colleagues, considers Biazon too outspoken, too hot-tempered and too 
political. "It was a compromise we can live with." 
</P>
<P>
Filipinos are living with a lot of compromises this bleak holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are mostly economic. Facing soaring costs for oil from the Mideast 
and drastically shrinking foreign reserves, the government raised fuel prices 
by an average of one-third early this month. Within days, prices were up for 
rice, chicken, transport, fertilizer and other necessities. 
</P>
<P>
The fuel hikes revealed remarkable government disarray. Prices actually were 
adjusted up and down three times in six days, the last two times after Aquino 
appeared on national TV to publicly appeal to her own energy board. At one 
point, gasoline prices were up by 130%, but then fell again. 
</P>
<P>
"It showed incredible ineptitude," said Rodolfo Romero, a lawyer and business 
columnist. Homobono Adaza, a lawyer allied with anti-Aquino politicians, 
agreed, saying, "I have never seen such a level of nincompoopery in 
government." 
</P>
<P>
The economic news has been almost all bad. Foreign investments have plummeted, 
the trade imbalance is worsening, and capital flight is growing, according to 
the Central Bank. The National Economic Development Authority forecasts more 
unemployment and inflation next year of 16% to 20%, compared to about 12% this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Partially to appease public anger, Aquino replaced her much-maligned executive 
secretary, Catalino Macaraig, with Transport Secretary Oscar Orbos, an 
energetic young politician with a flair for publicity. She also accepted the 
resignation of her unpopular trade and industry secretary, Jose S. Concepcion 
Jr., but has found no one yet willing to take his job. A further Cabinet revamp 
is expected. 
</P>
<P>
For now, the usually glittering Christmas lights along Ayala Avenue, the 
bustling center of the Makati business district, are mostly dark. Hotels are 
strangely quiet, shopkeepers are selling fewer toys and more basic goods, and 
travel agents complain that fewer Filipinos are traveling. Companies are 
holding fewer Christmas parties and warning of layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
While calls for a national strike have fizzled, small street protests are 
staged almost daily now to demand Aquino's resignation. The protesters, led by 
supporters of the late dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos, claim to have collected 
nearly 1 million signatures for her ouster but have offered no proof. Former 
Aquino supporters also have rallied to demand price rollbacks. 
</P>
<P>
And military leaders are hardly sanguine. Outgoing armed forces chief of staff 
Gen. Renato de Villa said recently that a spate of more than 40 bombings, most 
of them inconsequential, in Manila last fall involved "an operational alliance" 
between right-wing rebels and Communist guerrillas.

DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The specter of Vietnam hangs over the Persian Gulf like a recurring nightmare. 
It has shaped the way the United States would fight a war against Iraq, how the 
press would cover it, what the troops worry about in their moments of doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Even though few men here below the grade of lieutenant colonel or sergeant 1st 
class are old enough to have fought in Vietnam, the lessons of America's great 
misadventure have been lost on no one. From the White House to the ranks of 
teen-age privates, Vietnam is a memory that won't go away, and what everyone 
asks in one way or another is: Could it happen again? 
</P>
<P>
The answer, U.S. commanders in Saudi Arabia say, is no, providing that the 
United States can achieve the quick, decisive victory it would seek. "Let me 
assure you," President Bush told the nation this month, "should military action 
be required, this will not be another Vietnam. This will not be a protracted, 
drawn-out war." 
</P>
<P>
And Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of Operation Desert Shield and a 
decorated Vietnam battalion commander, told several journalists this week that 
if there is a war, "I am going to do everything I possibly can do to viciously 
destroy them (Iraqis) as rapidly as possible." In Vietnam, where the United 
States tried to win the "hearts and minds" of the people whom it ended up 
killing, no senior officer would have dared to utter such a blunt assessment of 
his mission. 
</P>
<P>
Although comparisons are tempting, particularly as a fledging anti-war movement 
in the United States rekindles visions from the '60s, the most elementary 
difference exists: A war against Saddam Hussein -- a primitive man disparaged 
by even the Arabs -- is winnable; the one against Ho Chi Minh -- a 
revolutionary hero of global repute -- was not. 
</P>
<P>
Ho's soldiers had fought the French for eight years and won. They knew the land 
and had wide popular support, even in South Vietnam. Against the Americans, his 
North Vietnamese and Viet Cong guerrillas owned the jungle and the night, 
neutralizing the United States' superior firepower. Their supply lines were 
able to survive B-52 bombardments and were generously nourished by Chinese, 
Soviet and East European allies. Their resolve to fight appeared infinite, and 
they matched each step of the gradual American buildup, even as their cities 
were being leveled and their harbors mined, with new attacks that resulted in 
more American casualties that led to more U.S. public disenchantment. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq would enjoy none of these advantages. Its troops would have no 
sanctuaries, as did Ho Chi Minh's in Cambodia and Laos. Even in Kuwait, the 
country they now claim as an Iraqi province, they are viewed as a murderous 
occupying force. They would not find an ally in the night. Instead, they would 
face new technology that would enhance the Americans' ability to fight in 
darkness. Their supply lines across the open desert would be vulnerable to the 
1,900 warplanes that will soon be on station here. Their communications and 
movements would be compromised by U.S. intelligence-gathering satellites. They 
would, in short, be forced to do something the Viet Cong never were: fight a 
war on America's terms. 
</P>
<P>
The goals of U.S. strategy in Vietnam were never quite clear. Here, if there is 
a war, they are: the use of maximum firepower to achieve the quickest possible 
victory. It would be a war that, for the first time this century, the United 
States would fight not to save a democracy but to protect its economic 
interests. It would capitalize on the lesson learned a generation ago that it 
is dangerous to nibble at the enemy while public support erodes. 
</P>
<P>
In Vietnam, it took eight years before the United States reached its peak 
strength of 540,000 troops in 1969. President Bush, well aware that Lyndon B. 
Johnson's measured escalation cost him the presidency, will have gotten 430,000 
troops in place here -- half the nation's worldwide combat strength -- in less 
than six months. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got a pretty good chunk of Marines in country," Brig. Gen. Mike Myatt, 
commander of the 1st Marine Division, said the other day. "I think that tells 
you we're serious." 
</P>
<P>
More than half the 58,000 U.S. dead in Vietnam were volunteers, not draftees. 
But this would be the first war fought by an all-volunteer army. Although 
grouching increases proportionately in relation to a soldier's distance from 
the front -- being considerably greater in the rear echelon, strangely -- most 
troops here give the impression of being well motivated and genuinely 
patriotic. 
</P>
<P>
"How do our troops stack up against those we had in Vietnam? They're better," 
said Master Gunnery Sgt. James Carter of Oceanside, Calif., a 27-year Marine 
veteran who served two tours in Vietnam. "No. 1, they get a lot better 
training. No. 2, they're an all-volunteer force. You don't get guys here just 
by chance like you did in Vietnam. I'm not going to say they're smarter or have 
a better level of education, but they pick up on things quicker. 
</P>
<P>
"I start feeling old when I realize I was in the service when some of their 
dads were just getting out of high school. The boys whose fathers were in 
Vietnam ask about the war, but most don't show a lot of interest. They were 
pretty quick to pick up on the fact that this is an entirely different 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you don't worry about ambushes. Even without the moon you can still see 
200 or 300 feet ahead of you at night. In Vietnam, you were lucky to see 12 
feet ahead. And there's the dust, something you didn't have in Vietnam. If 
there's movement out there and you're alert, you're warned. Yeah, the enemy can 
see you too, but I still like knowing where he is." 
</P>
<P>
Although names like the Ashau Valley and Hue and Dong Ha may mean nothing to 
today's soldiers, most are keenly aware that Vietnam veterans were not given a 
heroes' welcome home. "I'm proud serving my country here," a corporal said, 
"but I don't ever want to go back to the reception the 'Nam vets got." 
</P>
<P>
The tons of mail pouring into military post offices in Saudi Arabia -- much of 
it addressed to "Any Soldier" -- seems to have reassured the men and women in 
the Persian Gulf region that they do indeed have the public's backing. 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has affected media coverage as well. Fourteen hundred journalists have 
passed through Saudi Arabia since Aug. 2 and none -- except the network TV 
anchors -- has been given the freedom correspondents enjoyed in Vietnam to 
simply go where they wanted, hitchhiking rides on helicopters and linking up 
with units of their choice.

BAGHDAD, Iraq 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Less than a week after a delegation from Moscow persuaded the Baghdad 
government to let Soviet citizens working in Iraq go home, several hundred 
Soviet technicians are resisting departure, preferring to stay on rather than 
return to their unsettled homeland, Soviet and Western officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviets, reported to include military advisers as well as oil and 
electric-power experts, had been barred from leaving in a dispute over canceled 
contracts between Moscow and Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Visiting Soviet officials cleared up the conflict, Iraqi government officials 
said, but it now appears that some of the workers believe the rewards for 
staying in Iraq outweigh the danger of any approaching war over Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The Soviets think the situation here is better for them than in the U.S.S.R. 
They even believe the food situation is better here," a Western diplomat said, 
commenting on the irony that Iraq under a worldwide trade embargo might provide 
more food for the Soviets here than they would find at home. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly how many Soviets prefer to remain is impossible to determine. The 
number of Soviet citizens in the country is estimated to total 2,300, the 
remnant of about 9,000 who labored in Iraq before the Persian Gulf crisis 
erupted in August. 
</P>
<P>
Nor is it clear whether the Soviets will have any choice in the matter. They 
came to Iraq under contracts worked out between the two governments, and 
normally, Moscow would not permit free agency. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain technicians who do not want to leave," confirmed an official 
at the Soviet Embassy here. "But this decision must be made within the 
framework of state-to-state relations." 
</P>
<P>
As United States and allied forces prepare to drive Iraq out of Kuwait, the 
presence of Soviet military personnel as well as civilian experts has become a 
delicate international issue. The military experts may help Iraq maintain and 
operate advanced radar systems to counter the threat of air attack from the 
allied air force. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq appears to harbor hopes that political turmoil in Moscow will reverse 
Soviet political support for the global anti-Iraq coalition. Iraqi officials 
here speculated that dissident ministries in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
beleaguered government might quietly permit some of the technicians to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Until Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, Baghdad counted the Soviet Union among its 
staunchest allies. Moscow had supplied the regime of President Saddam Hussein 
with key weapons and economic help. 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet position changed dramatically during the Persian Gulf crisis. In the 
latest display of disappointment, Iraqi state newspapers printed unflattering 
farewells to Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who resigned Thursday as the Soviet 
foreign minister. 
</P>
<P>
The articles singled him out as a cause of the Iraqi-Soviet rupture. "In Iraq, 
Shevardnadze is looked upon with suspicion," one article declared. 
</P>
<P>
It accused Shevardnadze of overturning Moscow's longtime advocacy of an 
international conference to settle conflicts in the Middle East, the vehicle 
that Iraq wants to use to disperse the global focus from Kuwait to other 
regional disputes. It also described Soviet support for U.N. Security Council 
resolutions that demand Iraq's unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait as a 
"sellout." 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Foreign Minister Tarik Aziz described Shevardnadze as "not fair" to Iraq, 
according to a published account of a meeting last Monday between Aziz and the 
Soviet ambassador to Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
In contrast to their treatment of Shevardnadze, newspapers praised the Red Army 
as a bulwark against Soviet liberals, who are blamed here for Moscow's 
anti-Iraq stand. 
</P>
<P>
The article on Monday's meeting appeared to indicate that Iraq places its hopes 
in Moscow on the defense Establishment. "The army is known for nurturing a 
strong national pride and for following principled policies," the report said.

RYZHKOV CRITICIZES NEW CABINET SYSTEM; 
</P>
<P>
SOVIET UNION: THE EMBATTLED PREMIER, WHO USUALLY DEFENDS GORBACHEV, SAYS THE 
LEADER'S PLAN 'WILL CHANGE NOTHING IN THE COUNTRY.'

<P>
With the shock of his foreign minister's resignation still fresh, Soviet 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev came under criticism Saturday from yet another 
member of his inner circle -- Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the embattled prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, who usually defends Gorbachev, called the new Cabinet system the 
president is proposing to increase his control over the government "too 
cumbersome" and warned that it "will change nothing in the country." 
</P>
<P>
In a rare attempt to shift some of the blame for the Soviet Union's deepening 
crisis away from himself, Ryzhkov complained to reporters at the Congress of 
People's Deputies, the national Parliament, that "there have been a lot of 
mistakes, but why is it that I can say I'm responsible, while others, who 
walked side by side with me, do not? 
</P>
<P>
"Did we undertake perestroika only to tear our shirts five years later and say 
that we're on the edge of an abyss?" he continued. "Gorbachev remains my 
comrade, but he, too, is responsible for what is happening, just as I am. It 
must be said honestly what mistakes have been made." 
</P>
<P>
Liberals have been calling for Ryzhkov's resignation for months, contending 
that he has blocked needed economic reforms and proved incompetent in coping 
with the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has given Ryzhkov lukewarm support in recent months. Now, he appears 
to be seeking a dignified way to jettison the prime minister by proposing to do 
away with the Council of Ministers that Ryzhkov heads and choosing a more 
compact Cabinet, presumably under a different prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
But the Soviet president appears to be having trouble gathering the 
parliamentary support to make the needed constitutional amendments, and Ryzhkov 
supporters now believe that the 61-year-old engineer may not be as politically 
doomed as many have assumed. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if he would be willing to go on working with Gorbachev in the wake of 
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze's dramatic resignation Thursday, 
Ryzhkov once again appeared to distance himself from the president. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm prepared to work for the country, and not for some specific person," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Ryzhkov, in a further fragmentation of the Soviet leadership, appeared anxious 
to set out his own views on the country's current political and economic 
crisis. Although dubbed "The Crying Bolshevik" for his emotional reactions to 
criticism, his comments Saturday were notably hard-edged. 
</P>
<P>
He found fault, for example, with Gorbachev's handling of people. "Of all those 
who started the struggle for perestroika in 1985," he said, "I am the only one 
who remains at his side now, after Shevardnadze's resignation." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev's political nemesis, Russian Federation President Boris N. Yeltsin, 
got in a glancing blow as well, complaining that rumors of an anti-government 
conspiracy were spread intentionally -- although he did not specify by whom -- 
to further Gorbachev's push for more power. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an invention aimed at aggravating the situation so as to make strong 
presidential power a necessity," Yeltsin told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has been struggling in recent weeks to fight the country's economic 
and political disintegration by assuming more powers and launching a campaign 
for law and order, which has included the appointment of a tough new interior 
minister and warnings of a crackdown from the chief of the KGB security police. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, he issued a presidential decree that gives authorities in Moldova, 
the tiny southwestern republic riven by ethnic strife, 10 days to disband 
nationalist militias and dissolve two self-declared mini-republics whose 
creation sparked increased violence this fall. 
</P>
<P>
If they fail to obey, the decree warned, "necessary measures will be taken in 
accordance with the powers granted to the president by the constitution of the 
Soviet Union." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev has the constitutional power to introduce presidential rule in any 
area of the Soviet Union, imposing his direct control on local governments, and 
he can also declare a state of emergency and deploy troops to enforce it. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the three Baltic republics, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, say they 
are deeply afraid of a Kremlin crackdown in the near future, largely as a 
result of their open hostility toward the Soviet military units on their 
territory. 
</P>
<P>
Tension is especially high in Lithuania, where the army garrison in the port 
city of Klaipeda announced that it will begin patrolling the streets and 
checking civilians' documents, and in Latvia, where more than five bomb blasts 
in the past two weeks have frightened the population, although no one was 
injured. An explosion early Saturday blew out 200 windows at a military school 
in the Latvian capital of Riga, the official news agency Tass reported.

About 12,000 Albanians held the first legal opposition rally in decades, 
cheering demands for the release of political prisoners and for more reform in 
the Communist nation. Also, the country's trade union declared independence 
from the Communist Party, promising to fight for higher pay and better 
conditions for workers, a union official said. Chants of "Freedom!" and 
"Democracy!" echoed from the one-hour rally in Tirana, the capital.

There were no reports of injuries. The strongest of at least six temblors -- 
with a magnitude of 5.7 -- crumbled the wall of an empty prison, loosened

In the first test of the two-year-old law, a U.S. district judge late Friday 
upheld the federal statute that allows the imposition of the death penalty for 
drug-related killings. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. district judge rejected arguments that the statute was "impermissibly 
vague" or that it vested "unfettered discretion" in the hands of the 
government.

Stanislaus National Forest has completed acquisition of Bower Cave, which

The deal involved a land exchange with Fibreboard Corp. under which the Park 
Service obtained the 855-acre Linkletter Ranch, including the historic cave. 
Miwok Indians called the Mariposa County cave Oo-tin, meaning Home of the early 
Star and in the 1870s gold miners used the cave as a dance hall. Forest Service 
officials said access to the cave will be restricted because of potential 
hazards.

OFFICIALS TRY TO GUARD INDIAN SITE FROM OFF-ROADERS; 
</P>
<P>
LOS PADRES FOREST: RANGERS CLOSE ONE PATH IN HOPES OF PROTECTING A CHUMASH 
VILLAGE FOR ARCHEOLOGISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a decade, a state off-road vehicle park in the northeast corner 
of Ventura County has coexisted uneasily with neighboring Los Padres National 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
That relationship became increasingly difficult recently when forest rangers 
made what they believe is a rare archeological discovery -- the remains of a 
Chumash Indian village. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say the discovery in early December could be one of only a dozen 
village sites identified in the 2 million-acre forest and, because it has been 
undisturbed, could provide valuable information on the way the Chumash lived. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, forestry officials closed one of the main trails from the Hungry 
Valley State Vehicular Recreation Area into the national forest. But they fear 
off-road enthusiasts will find another way onto the trail and inadvertently 
harm the site before archeologists can thoroughly examine it. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a concern because we are trying to preserve as much history as 
possible," said Patrick Tumamait, an Ojai resident who has been active in 
Chumash affairs. "For vehicles to run over these sites is really bad. They are 
desecrating a lot of history." 
</P>
<P>
Before forestry officials can permanently reroute the trail, officials at the 
State Historic Preservation Office must decide if the site is genuine. This is 
done by examining historic records and the beads and broken tools that were 
unearthed -- a process that could take until February. 
</P>
<P>
The site was discovered by forestry officials with the help of historic records 
that document the locations where Spanish explorers found Indian villages in 
the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
Steven Horne, an archeologist for the national forest, said an undisturbed 
Indian village site can provide valuable information on the food-gathering 
habits and other daily routines of the Chumash. "A village site is the center 
of activity for the Indians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials, environmentalists and Chumash representatives say the 
episode is an example of a longstanding problem with off-road enthusiasts and 
vandals in an area that was once considered sacred by the Chumash Indians who 
inhabited it. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials have discovered countless Indian artifacts in the wooded 
area around Mt. Pinos -- the highest peak in Los Padres National Forest. Many 
caves scattered along the mountain ridges are decorated with Indian 
pictographs. 
</P>
<P>
"Presumably, they did drawings on the caves because those are sacred places," 
said Sally M. Reid, a member of the Sierra Club. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill this year to designate a 
portion of the Chumash's ancestral land as a wilderness area within the 
national forest. However, the bill died in the Senate when Congress adjourned. 
</P>
<P>
"Mt. Pinos itself was a sacred mountain," said John Johnson, the curator of 
anthropology at the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. "Most of those 
peaks in those areas have legends and are considered shrines." 
</P>
<P>
But off-roaders have caused forest officials grief by tearing through sensitive 
archeological sites, said Earl Clayton, a spokesman for the Los Padres National 
Forest. Vandals with spray cans have desecrated cave pictographs, and poachers 
-- known as "pot hunters" -- have made off with Indian bowls, beads and 
arrowheads, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Because the forest is so large and so rich with Indian culture, forestry 
officials cannot guard each site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We consider it urgent that we get in there as fast as possible," he said, 
referring to the latest discovery. 
</P>
<P>
When an important Indian site is identified, Horne said, the Forestry Service's 
policy is to protect it so historic and anthropological information can be 
gathered. This is done by diverting public trails away from the area and 
building natural barriers, such as berms and rock piles, to keep people off the 
site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials do not advertise the discovery of a site, Horne said, adding 
that the destruction of sensitive areas usually occurs when hikers and off-road 
enthusiasts stray from designated trails. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Tarnay, a Los Angeles resident who recently visited the off-road vehicle 
park, said he only rides his motorcycle on designated trails. He criticized 
those who plow through sensitive forest land on their bikes. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got plenty of room," he said. "I don't know why they would go out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Stefan LaCasse, a UCLA student who regularly rides his motorcycle in Hungry 
Valley, agreed. But he said he understands the fascination with leaving the 
well-worn trails to blaze new paths in the forest. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of temptation to go across a line that you are not supposed to 
cross," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Doberneck, a supervisor at Hungry Valley, said there are many trails 
that lead from the recreation area into the forest. He said there also are 
about 5,000 acres in the federal forest that are open to off-road vehicles. The 
Hungry Valley off-road recreation area is visited annually by about 200,000 
people. 
</P>
<P>
But he said the problem of off-road vehicles damaging Indian sites and 
artifacts is not limited to the Los Padres National Forest. Chumash artifacts 
have been discovered even in the Hungry Valley recreational area, which 
occupies 19,000 acres near Frazier Park on the forest's northeast border. 
</P>
<P>
Doberneck said he, too, diverts traffic from the sites of such discoveries. 
</P>
<P>
It is a misdemeanor to remove objects of historic or archeological significance 
from private land or a public park. It is also a misdemeanor offense to 
vandalize or in any way disturb Indian cave art. Both are punishable by a 
sentence of up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
Because it is difficult to catch people in the act of stealing or vandalizing 
Indian artifacts, officials at Hungry Valley have cited only one person in the 
past five years, Doberneck said. The person was found guilty and fined, 
Doberneck said. 
</P>
<P>
Clayton said he is uncertain how many people have been cited for stealing 
artifacts in the Los Padres National Forest, but estimated that about a dozen 
people are cited annually in the state's 18 national forests. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the artifacts found in the Los Padres forest, Johnson and Horne said, 
have come from temporary hunting camps, where Chumash stayed for only short 
periods while tracking deer or collecting berries and nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Forestry officials believe the site near Hungry Valley was a permanent 
encampment because it is near a large creek, and "any time you have a water 
source, it's highly probable the area could be a village site," Clayton said.

MEASURE M'S STREETS ARE PAVED WITH GOLD; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSPORTATION: $3 BILLION FOR ROAD AND RAIL PROJECTS IS UP FOR GRABS, AND 
SCORES OF BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING FOR THE GREEN LIGHT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Since the November day voters approved a sales tax that will generate $3 
billion for transportation projects in Orange County, Stan Oftelie's telephone 
hasn't stopped ringing. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie, executive director of the Orange County Transportation Commission, has 
a stack of 200 unanswered phone messages from would-be suitors eager for a 
slice of the Measure M pie. Suppliers, construction contractors and traffic 
consultants all want a piece of the action, and they know Oftelie's agency will 
help dictate who gets it. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never seen so many $1,000 suits," Oftelie confided one recent day after 
receiving a steady stream of emissaries from firms eager for Measure M work. 
</P>
<P>
When Oftelie attended a recent business association luncheon devoted to Measure 
M, guess who was in the audience? Suppliers. Contractors. Consultants. Indeed, 
when a moderator asked how many people were from firms hoping to reap some of 
the Measure M windfall, virtually everyone in the audience raised his hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll just stand by the door and write checks," Oftelie quipped as he surveyed 
all the hoisted hands. 
</P>
<P>
So it goes these days as Orange County gears up for a virtually unparalleled 
boom in road and rail construction. The national economy may be dipping toward 
recession, but the next few years promise a bull market for transportation folk 
in these parts. 
</P>
<P>
There will be plenty of obvious winners: the private road builders, the 
engineering designers, the environmental consultants and others. Some firms 
that hardly touched Orange County in years past promptly set up shop after news 
about the passage of Measure M spread. 
</P>
<P>
Other beneficiaries of Measure M will reap less tangible rewards. Many 
development firms and businesses backed the measure in hopes it would ease the 
pangs of traffic congestion that have gripped the county like a bad toothache 
in recent years. They know full well that congestion is the biggest factor 
behind any lingering anti-growth sentiment in the region. 
</P>
<P>
The list of Measure M campaign contributors provides a ready roll-call of the 
cross-section of companies and individuals who stand to benefit. Though only 
time will tell whether contributions to Measure M amount to a quid pro quo for 
firms wishing to get new contracts, there already have been some interesting 
developments. 
</P>
<P>
An early bond underwriting contract, for example, went to Kidder Peabody, which 
donated $5,000. Initially, the company was to be awarded the contract without 
competitive bidding, but then a consultant warned Oftelie and other officials 
at the county Transportation Commission that such an action could ignite a 
public relations disaster if the media learned of it. The contract was promptly 
put out to bid, 11 firms gave it their best shot and Kidder Peabody was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that that sort of Byzantine scenario will become standard 
operating procedure as Orange County perfects the art of doling out Measure M 
money. Most of the $3.1 billion to be raised during the next 20 years with a 
half-cent sales tax hike will find its way into construction contracts awarded 
by Caltrans, and the giant state agency by law must give the work to the lowest 
responsible bidder selected through a carefully scrutinized process. 
</P>
<P>
In turn, the money will trickle down to asphalt and cement suppliers, and the 
laborers who drive the backhoes and tractors. 
</P>
<P>
"The same contractors doing much of the work in the county right now will 
probably throw their hats in the ring for the new jobs coming up," said Frank 
Weidler, a Caltrans deputy district director in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Among the road construction firms now occupied in the county are the E.L. 
Yeager Co., which is extending the Costa Mesa Freeway and working on other 
projects, the Kasler Co., Brutoco Engineering and Steve Rados Inc., which is 
helping add lanes to the Santa Ana Freeway and upgrading Coast Highway in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
But there are others standing in line, such as Anaheim-based C.W. Poss Inc., 
which recently was selected by the county to build Pelican Hill Road across the 
Irvine Co.'s new Newport Coast development. 
</P>
<P>
Poss not only contributed $7,500 to the Measure M campaign, but the firm also 
helped raise $22,500 from 10 other construction-related companies. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to the (various construction companies) who would certainly benefit 
by it to some degree," said Charles Poss, the firm's founder. "We are in the 
construction business, but we also believe vehemently that something has to be 
done about traffic or else there will be real chaos in the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the big highway firms, however, did not contribute to the Measure M 
campaign except through the Fund for Construction Industry Advancement, which 
plopped down $50,000, and the Southern California Contractors Assn. Political 
Action Committee, which donated $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, transportation officials point out that the number of companies that 
did not give anything to the campaign far outnumbers those who did, and many of 
those that failed to contribute are likely to receive Measure M dollars too. 
</P>
<P>
Oftelie said a number of the phone calls he received after Measure M's approval 
were from strangers who will be given every chance to win contracts on their 
own merit. Indeed, so many people have called that OCTC plans to hold a 
workshop early next year to familiarize companies with the agency's contract 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
While newcomers are in the running for some contracts, the odds-on favorites 
are those that have an established track record with OCTC, Oftelie conceded. 
Among those is Willdan Associates, a firm that recently did the planning for 
installation of car-pool lanes on the Orange Freeway, a project due to go to 
construction by March. 
</P>
<P>
Within days of Measure M's passage, Willdan's Charles Lake met with Oftelie to 
"find out what the commission's plans are, seeing if there's some way we can 
help the commission achieve its goals," Lake recalled. 
</P>
<P>
Willdan contributed $2,500 to the Measure M campaign. Dan Hile, the firm's 
president, said the money was anted up only after Willdan officials were 
convinced that the donation would not merely be seen by others as an attempt to 
grab more contracts. He explained that the company has grown dramatically in 
recent years -- it now employs more than 700 people in several Western states 
-- and work generated by OCTC is only a small part of its business. "I also 
became convinced that Orange County really needs this," Hile added. 
</P>
<P>
But firms occupied with roads and freeways won't be the only beneficiaries of 
Measure M. Some $775 million will be spent on transit. Millions of dollars will 
go for new locomotives and railroad cars, sparking intense competition among 
manufacturers of those vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
OCTC officials, who plan to spend $44.4 million on new rail equipment in order 
to expand commuter service along the Amtrak line between Orange and Los Angeles 
counties, hope to dodge lobbyists from vehicle manufacturers by allowing their 
Los Angeles counterparts to purchase the trains. That's being done, officials 
said, because Orange County service is expected to be part of a regional rail 
system composed of compatible equipment. 
</P>
<P>
No U.S. manufacturers are expected to receive contracts for rail cars, 
transportation officials said, either because they're not interested or they 
can't compete with foreign firms that already supply equipment to the vast 
European and Asian rail systems. Passenger locomotives are manufactured by 
General Motors, but only in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
And if Orange County officials eventually decide to build a $1-billion central 
or "urban core" light rail or monorail system through five or six cities, as is 
being studied, European and Japanese firms are once again expected to receive 
the rail equipment contracts. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Monorail name is owned not by a U.S. company, but rather by a 
subsidiary of the Montreal-based Bombardier Corp., which produced the vehicles 
now carrying visitors at Disney World in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
There are, of course, many indirect beneficiaries of the Measure M windfall. 
</P>
<P>
The Irvine Co. and Disneyland, for example, loaned or contributed about 
$250,000 each to the $1.1-million Measure M campaign account, and they -- along 
with other developers and businesses -- could reap millions of dollars in 
profits from new projects made more feasible by Measure M's freeway, road and 
transit improvements. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not so much a help to sell new homes," explained Hugh Fitzpatrick, the 
Irvine Co.'s chief transportation planner. "It's that now it's more appropriate 
to grant approvals to build additional residential and commercial projects 
because transportation capacity is being provided. Before, the argument was 
that there's too much existing congestion. Now we can say it's being taken care 
of. . . . Transportation is sort of a critical element in people believing that 
development can be sustained." 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Fitzpatrick added, the Irvine Co. had always supported tax increases 
for transportation improvements since the early 1980s in the belief that the 
need was genuine. 
</P>
<P>
Money from Measure M to widen Interstate 5 south to San Clemente and for the 
reconstruction of the Santa Ana-San Diego freeway confluence, known as the El 
Toro Y, will ensure "superb regional access" to the Spectrum, the Irvine Co.'s 
master-planned office and industrial complex that straddles the interchange, 
Fitzpatrick acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
Disney officials also concede that Measure M will finance road and rail 
projects that should help ease the travel burden for employees and tourists 
trying to reach Disneyland and a second theme park that has been proposed for 
Anaheim. After all, much of the Measure M money will go to improve the Santa 
Ana Freeway, which runs past Disneyland's front doorstep, and other funds will 
surely be tapped to upgrade the traffic-choked thoroughfares surrounding the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly can't deny that it's going to be a help for us and make it a 
better experience for guests visiting Disneyland," said Ron Dominguez, a Disney 
executive vice president. "Nobody enjoys the traffic troubles we all experience 
in Orange County right now." 
</P>
<P>
But he also noted that Disney officials saw Measure M as an investment in 
Orange County as a whole, not just as a way to improve only the roads that lead 
to their theme park. 
</P>
<P>
"Our position was that we've been citizens of Orange County now for 35 years," 
Dominguez said. "We felt that Orange County has been good to Disney, and we 
needed to put something back into the community. It's not only a good 
investment in our future, but the county's future as well." 
</P>
<P>
Real estate experts, meanwhile, say the road and rail improvements ushered in 
by Measure M could prove a boon for some property owners. But a wider freeway 
past an office building or an upgraded intersection near a commercial complex 
can be a subtle thing, the sort of improvement that hardly causes the sales 
price for a piece of property to rocket through the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't see this thing as a boon to anyone in particular except all of us who 
drive cars in Orange County," said John Simon, a Newport Beach-based real 
estate lawyer. "I guess I've just never viewed the transportation problems as 
really affecting property values very much." 
</P>
<P>
The light rail or monorail being eyed for central Orange County could have the 
greatest impact, hiking the price of parcels all along the path it takes, 
suggested Scott Perley, an Irvine-based vice president at Cushman &amp; 
Wakefield, a nationwide commercial real estate firm. 
</P>
<P>
Perley noted, however, that Orange County has typically lacked the political 
will to accept the kinds of high-density office buildings that would cause land 
values to skyrocket along a central county light rail line. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, parcels around stations along the existing Amtrak route, which is 
being eyed for a fleet of Los Angeles-bound commuter trains, will hardly become 
a land speculator's dream, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of our rail stations have proven to be a great real estate 
location," Perley said.

FRIGID TEMPERATURES DAMAGE COUNTY CROPS; 
</P>
<P>
WEATHER: GROWERS IN THE OJAI VALLEY, WHERE THE OVERNIGHT LOW DROPPED TO 16 
DEGREES, ARE HIT THE HARDEST. THE COLD ALSO BURST WATER PIPES AND SENT THE 
HOMELESS IN SEARCH OF SHELTER.

<P>
Some Ventura County citrus and avocado crops sustained extensive damage despite 
all-night efforts to fight off the frost, as temperatures dipped into the teens 
early Saturday, growers said. 
</P>
<P>
The Ojai Valley was hardest hit, with temperatures dropping to 16 degrees, the 
coldest it has been in the area in more than 20 years, said Terry Schaeffer, 
agricultural meteorologist for the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Wilson, whose family owns 150 acres of avocado, lemon and orange groves 
on Coultas Ranch east of Ojai, feared her whole crop was lost. 
</P>
<P>
The family had taken precautions by spraying water on the trees to insulate 
them against the cold, but Wilson said it might not have been enough. 
</P>
<P>
"It helps to whatever extent it can," she said. "But it got so cold here last 
night . . . and oranges freeze at 28. And the avocados and lemons are much 
worse off at this point." 
</P>
<P>
The Coultas crops along a stretch of Grand Avenue sparkled with icicles all day 
Saturday after the spraying Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Taylor of Limoneira Associates in Santa Paula, the largest lemon company 
in the county, estimated that 30% of the crop was lost, despite use of 
sprinklers, wind machines, frost preventive sprays and helicopters to try to 
keep the temperatures up. 
</P>
<P>
When the temperature sinks to 30 degrees, wind machines and helicopters 
circulate the air to raise the temperature above the plants. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a little too soon to tell, but based on the temperatures and the duration 
of the temperatures, 30% is a conservative estimate," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The minimum temperature was in the low 20s for approximately five hours, which 
for lemons and avocados is pretty significant. Two hours below 28 and you start 
to lose the smaller fruit." 
</P>
<P>
Growers weren't the only ones affected by the dropping temperatures. The 
homeless flocked to shelters to escape the frigid temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
By 7 p.m. Saturday, the Ventura County Rescue Mission housed 77 people, and the 
staff was giving sleeping bags and blankets to those they turned away, Dave 
Shaw, operations manager, said. The Zoe Christian Center took in 162 people, 
and another 57 had taken refuge in the National Guard Armory by 8:30 p.m. The 
maximum capacity at the armory is 70. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California Gas Co. officials reported all-time record fuel consumption 
between Friday morning and Saturday morning as customers in the Southland 
cranked up the heat. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Fire Department reported at least 20 cases of broken water 
pipes that had frozen during the night. The pipes at the Ojai Valley School 
burst Saturday afternoon, causing flooding in the horse stables. 
</P>
<P>
Some relief from the cold could come today, said Steve Burback, a meteorologist 
for WeatherData Inc., which provides forecasts for The Times. Stronger winds 
and a high pressure system coming in from the Pacific Ocean should begin to 
raise temperatures today, he said. He expected lows to be mostly in the 30s and 
lower 40s tonight and in the 60s tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
Growers tonight will continue to try to keep temperatures as high as possible 
to avoid further damage. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Buettner, deputy agricultural commissioner for Ventura County, said it is 
too early to determine the extent of the destruction to the county's crops. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have our inspectors out looking next week to try to determine losses and 
evaluate the damage," he said. "It takes a while because you have to see how 
the crop develops." 
</P>
<P>
But Tom Pecht, an avocado and lemon grower in Somis, said he can already see 
the effects of the cold. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to tell immediately what the damage is, but with the avocados, when 
you see buds and leaves already brown or wilted, you know there's damage," he 
said. "As for the lemons, we won't know for a week or two, and then you can 
tell if the fruit has been frozen on the inside. But I can already see that 
some of the fruit is going to be damaged." 
</P>
<P>
One grower who considers himself pretty lucky is Phil Culbert, owner of Culbert 
Ranch in the Ojai Valley. While his neighbors were battling temperatures in the 
teens, his orchards had temperatures in the mid- to upper 20s. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some kind of air current here," he said. "The avocados have some 
damage, but the citrus seems to be OK. We are on an 8% slope and this causes 
cold air to move downhill a little bit. We have no frost protection equipment 
at all. We just rely on the slope of the orchard."

<P>
Hello, Darling: Sorry my letter and last couple phone calls have sounded so 
negative. Just my frame of mind. You know how moody I get . . . Jean, you are 
my life, and the corps is my life. It sounds contradictory, I know, but it 
isn't. I'm a Marine and your husband. When you married me, you married the 
corps. I know you realized that. 
</P>
<P>
Love, Walt 
</P>
<P>
The words Jeannie Baldwin's husband wrote almost three months ago while 
steaming toward the Persian Gulf aboard the amphibious assault ship Okinawa 
have never meant more than during this holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"I cried all the way home," Jeannie Baldwin said, recalling the dark drive last 
week from her Anaheim office when she finally realized that her new husband, 
Sgt. Walt Baldwin, wouldn't be coming home for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"For the last couple of years, I've always had him and his friends at my 
house," she said. "Last year, I had five or six Marines decorating my Christmas 
tree. Monday, it finally hit me that Walt wasn't going to be here this year, 
and his friends weren't going to be here either." 
</P>
<P>
This year, Jeannie Baldwin didn't bother to set up the tree, and it angers her 
when she sees the colorful lights decorating San Clemente and hears Christmas 
music in the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"For us, there aren't a lot of lights," she said. "There's a whole lot of us 
who don't feel that way about Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Dearest Jean, 
</P>
<P>
 Hello again. The date? Well, that's probably because I don't really know which 
day it is. . . . It's Saturday. I'll check later. Not that it really matters. 
The only important day is the day I come home. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I love you, Jean. Your letters are the only things that keep me sane. Keep 
them coming, love. Sometimes at night, when I can't sleep, I wonder what you're 
doing. Are you at work? At home? How you look while you're sleeping. The way 
you felt in my arms. . . . I miss you terribly, my love. I keep hoping for mail 
call so that I can hear from you." 
</P>
<P>
Walt and Jeannie Baldwin, both 28, grew up together in Lafayette, Calif. "We 
were like brother and sister during those years," she said. When Walt Baldwin 
moved to Southern California four years ago to continue his Marine Corps 
career, Jeannie Baldwin followed. 
</P>
<P>
Only married since March, their separation began in June when Walt Baldwin left 
his duty station at Camp Pendleton for what was to be a six-month overseas tour 
and a pre-Christmas return. 
</P>
<P>
That was the plan until Saddam Hussein's troops ran through Kuwait in early 
August and Walt Baldwin's unit was tapped while on duty in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, letters have been pouring into Jeannie Baldwin's San Clemente home 
and her office from her husband, his shipmates and other servicemen who long 
for any communication from home. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwins won't be exchanging Christmas gifts this year. Instead, they will 
be continuing to flood the mails with letters. In the nearly six months they 
have been separated, time has been chronicled in dozens of dispatches Jeannie 
Baldwin keeps neatly bound in two heavy notebooks. 
</P>
<P>
Jeannie, 
</P>
<P>
 I haven't really been getting much mail of late, so after I finished work 
tonight, me and a friend stopped at the post office tent and grabbed a couple 
of service-member letters. 
</P>
<P>
 My name is Kyle Webster. I am . . . in the Air Force. Unlike some of my 
contemporaries, I am at a base that billets us in tents. . . . We have been 
here at our classified location since August 10. Nobody knows when we're going 
home. I tell people six months, meaning early February, but we all hope for 
X-mas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though we aren't on the front lines, we still don't have too many 
facilities. Like I said, we live in tents, shower in tents, eat in tents. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As for my job, I am a weapons load crew chief, and I am originally from Napa, 
Ca. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, thanks for the letter. It's great to know that people we don't know are 
supporting us. 
</P>
<P>
Sincerely, Kyle Webster 
</P>
<P>
Other letters come from Walt Baldwin's friends who have shared the Gatorade, 
fruit cups, beef jerky, cookies and potato chips Jeannie Baldwin has assembled 
in occasional shipments of care packages. 
</P>
<P>
One of the men, Marine Sgt. M.D. (Phil) Phillips, has become a steady pen pal, 
and their friendship grows with each letter she receives. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the men are single guys," Jeannie Baldwin said. "The married guys get 
a whole lot of attention. He (Walt) tells me when their birthdays are or when 
there is a promotion. Some of the guys I write I've known for years. Some I 
don't know at all." 
</P>
<P>
Hi, Jeannie, 
</P>
<P>
 How goes it? It goes well with me. It's 6:30 a.m., and I'm standing in line 
for breakfast. Got your card 2 days ago, great. This is my second letter since 
then. I'm sorry, sometimes I lose track. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wally told me about how you sometimes go to Mass. If you ever get a prayer out 
for ol' Phil it's appreciated. I'm not the most religious guy you'll meet, but 
I do know that the man upstairs is controlling things. Well, I have to quit. 
It's my turn to eat. I'll continue later. 
</P>
<P>
Your friend, Phil 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Hi Jeannie, 
</P>
<P>
 How goes it? It goes well with me. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Been at sea more than 40 days. Once we get back from the field, we get TWO 
WHOLE BEERS for all our suffering. I don't really care. I can take 'em or leave 
'em. But there (are) guys on board hurting so bad, they would pay $10 to $20 
for these beers. But I'm going to take my two and make at least one toast to a 
very special friend, Jeannie Baldwin. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Walt still seems in good cheer, but I can tell he misses you bunches. So keep 
your hand on the pen and the pen on the paper, and let him know how ya doing. 
</P>
<P>
Your friend, Phil 
</P>
<P>
With her husband away, Jeannie Baldwin, an office manager for an Anaheim 
construction company, fills her free hours visiting or talking on the telephone 
with other separated military spouses. She is a member of two support groups, 
one at Camp Pendleton and an Anaheim-based group that meets the first Sunday of 
every month. 
</P>
<P>
"There are days when that is the only way I get through," she said of her 
support group associations. "At least you know you're not the only one." 
</P>
<P>
There are also days when the most routine of chores opens a floodgate of 
emotion. 
</P>
<P>
"When I go to the gas station, I feel like if anybody says anything to me about 
the price of gas I'll go off on them. I'll tell them about the price of my 
husband." 
</P>
<P>
Good Morning, Love, 
</P>
<P>
 How's the light of my life, today? Things are the same here, day-in and 
day-out. . . . We were at condition 3 steaming for a while (guns manned). Now, 
we're at 3A, which is guns up but not manned. So don't worry your pretty little 
head off. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't even know when I'm going to see you or for how long. The worst part is 
the waiting. . . . In some ways, I feel we are giving the Iraqis the military 
edge. Right now, they are fortifying their positions and that will make my job 
harder each day. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 If this draws on out, I wouldn't be surprised if we end up with bases in Saudi 
Arabia, as we have in Korea. In the long run, it will be cheaper. How's that 
for a duty station of choice. Spend time on the wonderful scenic sands of Saudi 
Arabia! I can see the travel brochures now. 
</P>

Love, Walt

Last week, Jeannie Baldwin felt she had to vent the loneliness and anger she 
has been feeling this holiday season. She called a Los Angeles radio talk show 
and debated the use of a traditional greeting card wish: Peace on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
"I have never called a radio talk show, but peace on Earth is hard for us to 
understand. It's hard to see all the celebration this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
Walt Baldwin was supposed to be home last Thursday. They were expecting to 
celebrate their first Christmas as man and wife. Instead, she received another 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
Jean, 
</P>
<P>
 Are you tired of this? I am. We are looking at another three to six months. 
But this is my job, it's what I do. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I happen to believe we're right to do what we're doing. It's not about oil. 
It's about one man (country) thinking he can impose his will forceably on 
another country. That's not right. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The news says our president is losing support for this in both the Congress 
and with the American public. I hope not. I would hate to think that all these 
guys here doing our jobs are just going to be chastised like our people were 
after Vietnam. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I don't care what anyone (liberal or otherwise) says. A person who uses force, 
only understands force and thinks talk is a weakness or a delay. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess what I'm saying, Jean, this is my life. If it doesn't agree with you 
and you don't want to wait around wondering whether I'll come back or when I'll 
come back, I'll understand. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, Jean. I love you so much and would like nothing better than to be in your 
arms. Just keep a candle burning to light my way home so I can find you after 
this long night is over. 
</P>
<P>
Love you, Walt

ECONOMIC LAG OVERSHADOWS VENTURA BLVD. GROWTH PLAN; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: CONSTRUCTION ALONG THE 17-MILE CORRIDOR IS DORMANT BECAUSE OF THE 
FISCAL CLIMATE. BUILDERS MAY EVENTUALLY GRAVITATE TO LESS-CONTROLLED 
THOROUGHFARES.

<P>
The stringent growth controls in the soon-to-be-adopted Ventura Boulevard 
Specific Plan are likely to have little immediate effect because of the slowing 
economy, experts say -- an ironic finish to a years-long effort to curb 
development. 
</P>
<P>
Even when the real estate market picks up, land-use authorities said, it is 
likely that builders will locate new projects along cheaper, less-regulated 
corridors such as Sepulveda and Van Nuys boulevards. That will be a triumph for 
residents near Ventura Boulevard, perhaps, but a bane to homeowners elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan has significance, but it is currently overshadowed by the economy," 
said Bruce Kusada, a senior sales consultant with the Charles Dunn Co. of 
Encino. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest restriction on new development is really the much tighter 
underwriting requirements for construction and permanent loans. And without 
financing for real estate -- with or without the Specific Plan -- you wouldn't 
see a lot of construction occurring." 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited Specific Plan, a sweeping set of building controls for all 17 
miles of Ventura Boulevard, received tentative City Council approval Tuesday 
and is expected to be adopted Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Also slated for approval Jan. 4 is a modified building moratorium that would 
strictly limit, but not freeze, Ventura Boulevard building permits. The interim 
control ordinance, which could be in effect as long as six months, was proposed 
by Councilman Michael Woo to give city officials time to digest and implement 
the new Specific Plan. 
</P>
<P>
A testament to the slow-growth movement, the complicated Specific Plan will 
control development on the boulevard from Studio City in the east to Woodland 
Hills in the west. It will dictate the size, height and use of buildings, and 
will generally try to encourage pedestrian-friendly projects such as 
ground-floor shops and sidewalk cafes instead of the high-rise office buildings 
and shopping centers built during the late 1970s and 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the plan charges developers a fee for every additional 
vehicle trip their project is expected to generate during the evening rush 
hour. Those funds are to be used for new traffic signals, wider streets and 
other congestion remedies. 
</P>
<P>
A citizens advisory committee began work on the plan in 1986, a time when 
developers flush with construction loans were putting up glitzy office 
buildings and shopping centers with high-priced stores. Residents of the mostly 
affluent communities along the boulevard watched angrily while the markets and 
bookstores they had patronized for years were steadily replaced -- -- and while 
traffic taxed their neighborhood streets. 
</P>
<P>
Today, however, the Valley's commercial real estate industry is dormant because 
of a dearth of financing for new construction and, according to a recent survey 
by Grubb &amp; Ellis Commercial Real Estate Services, an average 14% vacancy 
rate in existing space. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Center, the Valley's latest prestige office address, has a 20% vacancy 
rate, although that figure reflects a large office tower that opened only a 
year ago. Ventura Boulevard's 5-year-old Encino Terrace Center, commonly known 
as the Fujita building, has a vacancy rate of slightly less than 10%, its 
broker said. 
</P>
<P>
Land-use lobbyist Larry J. Kosmont said the timing of the Specific Plan's 
approval is ironic but not surprising, given the length of time controversial 
measures take to be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for control usually is generated at a time when economic 
productivity is at its highest," said Kosmont, whose Burbank-based firm helps 
private developers and cities obtain building rights. But, he continued, "the 
impact of the controls is typically felt when the economy is at its lowest." 
</P>
<P>
Once the market picks up, the Specific Plan will be in place to control new 
development, city officials and slow-growth activists said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have faith that the economy will rebound and at that time, developers will 
want to build," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners 
Assn. "In two years, we may be back in a boom, so this is the time to do the 
planning." 
</P>
<P>
But both Close and Kosmont agreed that builders will also turn to other areas 
of the Valley when financing is easier to get. Sepulveda Boulevard is already 
the site of a nascent financial center and Kosmont predicted that Van Nuys 
Boulevard will be attractive because of its large, relatively inexpensive lots. 
North Hollywood and Burbank may also become the sites of intense development. 
</P>
<P>
"The development will just move. It will find a path of least resistance," 
Kosmont said. 
</P>
<P>
Others said that Ventura Boulevard's vocal homeowner groups and existing 
interim control ordinance, in effect while the Specific Plan was being 
prepared, have already done their part to block high-rise development. The 
ordinance has generally limited buildings to three stories -- considered too 
tall by many neighborhood activists but modest compared with the 20-story 
towers of Warner Center or Encino's financial district. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it just validates, if you will, what's been occurring on Ventura 
Boulevard for some time," Howe Foster, district manager for Grubb &amp; Ellis 
in Sherman Oaks, said of the Specific Plan. "It doesn't change very much." 
</P>
<P>
Another investment specialist, Encino accountant Arnold Dubin, predicted that, 
perversely, the Specific Plan will prompt a flurry of applications for building 
permits by landowners who want to put projects in the pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
The plan sets ceilings on the number of additional car trips for each of the 
boulevard's five communities -- Studio City, Sherman Oaks, Encino, Tarzana and 
Woodland Hills -- and Dubin said that landowners will flock to reserve their 
building rights before the trip quotas are filled. 
</P>
<P>
"It will encourage people to develop their property, rather than be faced with 
the economic risk of having their land frozen," Dubin said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, others said that while remodeling and redevelopment will always take 
place, the building frenzy Ventura Boulevard saw during the last decade is 
unlikely to be repeated. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say that development as we know it on the boulevard is pretty much 
over," said investment specialist Jim Nolan of Grubb &amp; Ellis.

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK JERRY HICKS: IGNORING THE 'BUMS' USED TO BE SO EASY . . .

<P>
Most journalists in my office have always had genuine, heartfelt concern for 
the homeless. Not me. 
</P>
<P>
Frankly, I've been too busy. I have a kid to raise, a wife who wants me home 
nights, bosses to please and bills to pay. My compassion is for the plight of 
the Los Angeles Rams and the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
I've found my own way of dealing with the homeless that's gotten me by just 
fine -- I don't think about them. 
</P>
<P>
Which is why it's so unsettling that I've had Earl on my mind lately. 
</P>
<P>
Earl is this guy who lives on the concrete at the Plaza of the Flags in the 
heart of the Civic Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
I first came across Earl stretched out underneath the stars and his Catholic 
Charities blanket close to a year ago, as I walked through the plaza from my 
courthouse office to my car. His first words to me were: "Sir, you have a good 
evening." My first words to him were a grunt. And why not? It's a beautiful 
plaza, and this unsightly, unshaven, unkempt, unwelcome sprawling figure was 
trashing up the place with his blankets and shopping cart teeming with life's 
leftovers. 
</P>
<P>
By day, Earl was out scavenging. I'd see him only at night. "Sir, you have a 
good evening." Earl was a broken record. Same message every night. 
</P>
<P>
He had no idea he was intruding at a bad time, that twilight of the day when 
your brain is oozing out of its work mode and trying desperately to climb into 
the proper frame of mind for facing the wife and kid. It's not a time for small 
talk with the city's vagabonds. But after a few months, I decided he meant no 
harm. 
</P>
<P>
He wasn't Earl to me then, of course. He was just this nameless lie-about. A 
few months more, it came to me that Earl seemed to smile more than I did and 
seemed to care much more about my evening than I did about his. 
</P>
<P>
And then this funny little thing happened. Earl started to make me feel good. 
This bent-over piece of humanity with hollows at his shoulder blades seemed 
determined to make me smile back at him. My Scrooge-like grunts finally warmed 
up to at least "hellos" and "you doing OK?" I found myself leaving the 
courthouse wondering if Earl would be in the plaza. Earl's greeting helped ease 
the day's grind. Finally, I sheepishly realized that it was long overdue that 
we meet each other. 
</P>
<P>
Earl is a 53-year-old, skinny, raggedy, mostly toothless man who has been "on 
the road," as he calls it, the past five years. He won't tell me his last name. 
But he has a daughter somewhere back East that he still thinks about, and he 
really would work, but he explains the problem in a way that makes sense: 
"Nobody wants to hire someone like me, at my age. Only jobs I can get are the 
ones worth $20 an hour but they want you to do it for minimum wage." 
</P>
<P>
Says Earl: 
</P>
<P>
"I pick this spot because it's quiet. I love the peace and quiet. I love being 
alone. I've got a couple of row dogs (fellow homeless) who join me here most 
times, and we talk when we want. Don't you worry about me none, sir. I'm doin' 
just fine." 
</P>
<P>
That's the problem. I am worried about Earl. Because it's getting cold out. 
Winter is here and getting worse, and Earl's blankets are thinner than what I'm 
using at night inside a heated house. I try not to think about how many other 
Earls are out there facing those same cold nights with biting wind and icy 
concrete beds. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to ignore the homeless, to leave such problems to folks like Catholic 
Charities, and hope their budgets can be stretched far enough to cover the 
basics. 
</P>
<P>
But it's hard to forget about Earl, once you've met him.

STUDENT PLANE CRASH-LANDS AT WAYNE AIRPORT

A flight instructor and student, who thought their wheels were down, 
crash-landed Saturday at John Wayne Airport on their third practice landing of 
the day, county firefighters reported. No one was injured. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Dan Young, a Fire Department spokesman, said the single-engine Cherokee 
Arrow slid across the 19 Left Runway about noon after making two successful 
touch-and-go maneuvers. Its propeller was bent and the underside of the 
fuselage was damaged. 
</P>
<P>
On the third pass, Young said, the plane came in without its landing gear 
extended, despite seven warnings from the control tower. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was just grand until the last two feet," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
Aboard were instructor Leslie Glatt, 45, of Redondo Beach, and his student, 
Charles Kelly, 42, of Costa Mesa. They are members of the JG 52 Flying Club. 
</P>
<P>
Once out of the plane, both said a green light in the cockpit had indicated the 
wheels were down, and they wondered why the control tower had not notified them 
about the problem. But Capt. Brian Stevens, the crash crew supervisor at John 
Wayne, said the landing gear lever was in the "up" position when he arrived. 
</P>
<P>
About 16 firefighters and a fire engine based at the airport responded to the 
crash. Young said some private planes had to circle the airfield for a few 
minutes until the situation was under control. No commercial flights were 
delayed. The Federal Aviation Administration is investigating the accident.

IMMIGRANTS FEEL JOY OF CHRISTMAS, A PEACE OF MIND

SANTA ANA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last year the Istudors, a Romanian family of four, spent a Christmas fraught 
with uncertainty and fear. 
</P>
<P>
Valeriu Istudor, a 36-year-old mechanic and truck driver, was alone in Austria, 
having escaped in June from his native country to Yugoslavia -- where he 
languished in a Belgrade prison for 45 days -- before arriving near Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Livia, 33, and their two children were still back in their home near 
Timosoara, where the revolution that eventually toppled dictator Nicolae 
Ceausescu had begun earlier in the month. On Christmas Day last year, the three 
sat huddled in front of the television set, fearing for their safety and 
listening to reports of Ceausescu's execution. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the Istudors are spending the holidays together again, after 
reuniting in Austria and coming to Orange County last month. On Saturday, they 
and hundreds of other newly arrived immigrants and refugees gathered to 
celebrate Christmas at an annual party sponsored by the Catholic Charities of 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"For all of them, it's their first Christmas in America," said volunteer 
coordinator Celine Prevost of the Catholic Charities' resettlement services 
program, which helps its clients with purchases of food and household items. 
</P>
<P>
Although the new arrivals usually have relatives already here, she said, 
Saturday's party gave them a chance to experience an American Christmas -- 
complete with stacks of gifts and Santa Claus, who ho-ho-hoed his way past 
scores of delighted children in the assembly hall packed with more than 400 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"It is something special for the children," Valeriu Istudor agreed, as he and 
his family prepared to return to his brother's Fullerton home after the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
His sister-in-law, Kathleen Istudor, said that meeting Santa Claus was an extra 
treat for the children, who had heard stories about him and his flying reindeer 
only the night before. The two youngsters had grown up with the Romanian legend 
of "Mos Craciun" -- "The Old Man of Christmas," a rather frightening figure in 
furs who appears to children on Christmas Day to demand a strict accounting of 
their deeds before distributing gifts. 
</P>
<P>
The sight of the jolly man in the red suit also excited 4-year-old Martin 
Siwek, who trooped up excitedly to collect his gift. 
</P>
<P>
Martin and his parents, Andy and Elizabeth Siwek, arrived in Orange County in 
January after a two-year wait for a visa from what was formerly West Germany. 
They had settled there after leaving eastern Poland for, ostensibly, a short 
camping trip in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was only a trick," said Elizabeth Siwek. "We had to pay for a very 
expensive camping place and get visas for Italy, Switzerland and West Germany." 
</P>
<P>
Although several other families from Eastern European countries attended the 
fete Saturday, most of the party-goers were from Vietnam. As a Vietnamese choir 
sang Christmas carols in its native tongue, Bishop Mike Driscoll wished them 
"Merry Christmas" in exuberant, if not correctly accented, Vietnamese that 
prompted them to smile, happy to be among congenial company. 
</P>
<P>
Among them was Lan Nguyen, a 32-year-old widow who lives with her two young 
sons in Santa Ana. Her boys stood by, one of them jealously guarding a gift 
nearly half his size, as she expressed how happy she was to spend her first 
Christmas in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"In Vietnam they don't have presents and people gathering like this," she said 
through an interpreter. Then, directing her gaze to the white-bearded man who 
sat on the stage laughing and passing out gifts, she added: "Thank you, Santa 
Claus."

2 YOUTHS BADLY INJURED WHEN STRUCK BY CARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two Ventura County children were seriously injured Saturday when they were hit 
by cars in separate accidents. 
</P>
<P>
An 8-year-old Oxnard boy was hit Saturday afternoon as he ran into the street 
at Del Sol Park, Oxnard police said. 
</P>
<P>
At 12:26 p.m., Hugo Alcala ran into traffic near the intersection of Rose 
Avenue and San Gorgonio Street and hit the side of a moving vehicle driven by 
Margaret Trevino, 29, also of Oxnard, police said. Hugo was taken to Ventura 
County Medical Center and admitted to intensive care, where he was reported in 
guarded condition Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Trevino was cited by officers for driving without a license, police said. An 
investigation is continuing. 
</P>
<P>
At about 2 p.m. in the 300 block of North Ojai Road, 17-year-old Cecilia 
Rodriquez was struck by a car driven by her father, Eduviges Rodriquez, and 
knocked through a block fence, Santa Paula police said. Cecilia was taken to 
Santa Paula Memorial Hospital and then was transferred to Ventura County 
Medical Center, where she underwent surgery. 
</P>
<P>
No arrests were made, and the investigation is continuing, police said.

TV SHOW ACCIDENTALLY LEADS TO MAN'S ARREST

<P>
A Los Angeles man sought on charges of abducting his 13-year-old daughter was 
arrested a month after a TV program featured a similar case, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
Guillermo E. Bonilla was arrested at his home in Point Roberts, Wash., Friday 
for investigation of two counts of using a false Social Security number, an FBI 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla lived five years in Point Roberts as Robert William Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
An "Unsolved Mysteries" episode shown Nov. 21 covered a 1983 Montana kidnaping. 
School officials in Tsawwassen, Canada, north of Point Roberts, thought they 
recognized the victim as Bonilla's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla's daughter was not the one involved in the Montana case but had been 
reported missing in the Los Angeles area in 1983, the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
She was found in Bonilla's house last week and placed with Child Protective 
Services pending a reunion with her mother in California. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla was scheduled for arraignment Wednesday on federal Social Security 
charges in Seattle. He faces extradition on child detention charges.

SOCKERS START FAST, TOP BLAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE KERZEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
BALTIMORE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The scenario seemed all too familiar: The Sockers charge out to a big, early 
lead then watch helplessly as a Baltimore Blast rally falls short in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It's the script that the teams have written time and again. It usually happens 
in the postseason, where the Sockers three times have vanquished the Blast in 
the MSL Championship Series. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday night, in front of 8,184 at the Baltimore Arena, the Sockers added a 
regular-season wrinkle to the old routine. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Dougherty scored a pair of goals, and goalkeeper Victor Nogueira made 20 
saves to help the Sockers beat the Blast, 5-4. The victory improved the 
Sockers' record to 10-10 -- and 15-21 in regular-season games against 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers scored the first four goals as Baltimore (10-9) played right into 
Coach Ron Newman's hands with a physical game that never threw them off kilter. 
Nogueira held Baltimore scoreless during the first half, then withstood a late 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the way they play -- fast and furious," said Dougherty, who played last 
season in Baltimore. "What we tried to do was to calm the pace down, weather 
the storm and pick our spots." 
</P>
<P>
When the Blast tried getting rough, the Sockers didn't flinch. Instead, they 
ran up and down the field as the Blast desperately tried to regroup. It showed 
most in the first half, when the Sockers stormed to a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"In this league, you can't expect to win if you spot a team a 3-0 lead," said 
Blast goalkeeper Scott Manning, who made 20 saves and kept the Blast in the 
game with 12 stops in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
"When we get revved up . . . and start going forward and putting pressure on 
the other team, that's when we're vulnerable. San Diego is a great 
counterattack team, and what we did tonight played right into their hand." 
</P>
<P>
Newman said his team was much more focused than in its 11-6 loss Friday at 
Cleveland, a setback that snapped a four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what we had to do, and that was to stay focused the whole game, 
especially after what happened against Cleveland," Newman said. "Baltimore 
caught us in that position. It was bad luck for Baltimore, but good luck for 
us."' 
</P>
<P>
The Sockers got a lift from Branko Segota, who scored a goal for the third 
consecutive game after missing 13 games with a cracked right fibula. 
</P>
<P>
"Branko played his best game of the year so far for us," Newman said. "He's not 
been quite ready when I used him in bits and pieces, but when he gets in there 
all along he does well. This is the best I've seen Branko play in two seasons." 
</P>
<P>
A holding penalty against Baltimore defender Mike Stankovic set up Dougherty's 
19th goal of the season, which gave the Sockers a 1-0 lead 4:59 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
Dougherty took a shot from the upper right corner of the penalty area, and the 
ball glanced off the crossbar and straight up. Manning fell down, the ball 
bounced to the ground and its backspin carried it into the goal. 
</P>
<P>
Segota then scored from the left wing, taking a cross-field pass from Alex 
Golovnia and beating Manning with a shot to the far post. 
</P>
<P>
Wes Wade scored his 12th goal of the season to complete a Sockers counterattack 
late in the first half, and, after Dougherty scored his second goal of the 
game, it was 4-0. On that play, Dougherty took a heel pass from Segota, blew by 
defender Angelo Panzetta in the center of the penalty area and slipped a 
right-footed shot between Manning and the right post. 
</P>
<P>
Just 1:25 later, Baltimore finally got on the scoreboard, courtesy of David 
Vaudreuil's third goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"Once they got that first goal," Newman said, "it became difficult to contain 
them. That's what started it up for them. That's all it took to get them 
going." 
</P>
<P>
After Blast forward Domenic Mobilio scored to make it 4-2, the Sockers' Paul 
Wright caught Baltimore's Richard Chinapoo in a line change and scored to give 
the Sockers a 5-2 cushion. Wright took an outlet pass from Nogueira, sped down 
the right side and beat Manning from 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Chinapoo atoned for his error 2:31 into the fourth period. Chinapoo fluttered a 
shot in from the top of the penalty area, catching Nogueira out of position to 
score his ninth goal of the year. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the fourth quarter, Baltimore shaved the lead to 5-4 on a goal 
by Mark Mettrick. Mettrick chested in a feed out of the right corner from Mike 
Reynolds at 8:41. 
</P>
<P>
Blast coach Kenny Cooper pulled Manning for sixth attacker Billy Ronson with 
2:17 left in the game, but Baltimore failed to get the equalizer. Ronson, 
meanwhile, was forced to make a pair of saves in his short stint, including a 
diving stop on a header by Segota.

Hank Egan is stuck on 99. 
</P>
<P>
With a 73-69 loss to Eastern Washington Saturday night on Reese Court, the 
University of San Diego men's basketball team once again failed to earn Egan 
his 100th career victory. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Toreros' (5-4) fourth consecutive loss -- all on the road -- after 
they opened the season 4-0, while Eastern Washington (4-5) broke a four-game 
losing streak of its own. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a good effort," said Egan, "the road is just starting to beat us down." 
</P>
<P>
Although down 42-33 at the half, USD made a run in the end, cutting Eastern 
Washington's lead to two twice. 
</P>
<P>
Down 65-56 with 6:41 to go, USD ran off seven consecutive points to cut the 
Eagles lead to 65-63 with 3:33 left. In that run, Wayman Strickland had a free 
throw, Dondi Bell scored from the inside, Michael Brown made two free throws 
and Kelvin Woods had a rebound layup. 
</P>
<P>
USD committed 20 turnovers to Eastern Washington's nine, and shot 40% (22 of 
55) from the field.

NORTH HOLLYWOOD TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TITLE A CAKEWALK FOR GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A few moments after his team had handily won the North Hollywood tournament 
Saturday night, Granada Hills High Coach Bob Johnson was handed a microphone 
and asked to offer a few words about each player. 
</P>
<P>
He hemmed. 
</P>
<P>
He hawed. 
</P>
<P>
He almost blushed. 
</P>
<P>
His team had no such trouble getting started -- and was nowhere near as humble. 
The Highlanders are ready for prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills scored 35 points in the second quarter and easily routed El 
Camino Real, 106-73, in the championship game. It marked the Highlanders' third 
North Hollywood tournament title in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills, the lone City Section 4-A Division team in the event and the 
top-ranked team in the region by The Times, squeezed 19 first-half turnovers 
out of the young Conquistadores, who started two sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
The game might have been over in the first five minutes, by which time Granada 
Hills (10-1) had rolled up a 15-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
How lopsided was it? El Camino Real's starting center, Chris Teich, left for 
the locker room with a gash on his elbow in the first quarter, leaving behind a 
trail of blood on the hardwood. 
</P>
<P>
"We started in a man-to-man, full-court press," Johnson said. "That seemed to 
rattle them a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
It was shake, rattle and roll, right to the title. 
</P>
<P>
"We just came out and went right for the championship," Granada Hills forward 
Jerry Allen said. "We put the pressure on." 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills led, 56-25, at halftime, and three Highlander players had already 
reached double figures. Allen blew open the game by scoring 12 of his game-high 
26 points in the third quarter as Granada Hills took a 78-52 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Allen, selected the tournament's most valuable player, emerged from a scoring 
rut of sorts. The 6-foot-4 senior had scored 23 points in each of the past four 
games. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Allen has been playing so well that Johnson seems to be getting 
spoiled. Maybe he has his reasons -- Allen was averaging 22.5 points, 12.9 
rebounds and six assists entering the game. Allen also had 17 rebounds and five 
assists against the Conquistadores. 
</P>
<P>
"He scored 26 points?" Johnson said. "That was a sneaky 26." 
</P>
<P>
The rest of the attack was as direct as a head-on collision. Six Highlanders 
scored in double figures as Johnson cleared the bench. Leading the the 
double-digit honor roll were George Vicuna and Adrian Sellers with 12 points 
each. Sagy Koren, Randy Eason and Shelton Simmons added 11. 
</P>
<P>
Markee Brown, a sophomore, led El Camino Real with 24 points. Clyde Price added 
14 and Sam Sarpong, another sophomore starter, scored 13. 
</P>
<P>
Allen put the game away for good -- not that it was really in doubt -- by 
scoring three consecutive Highlander baskets in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After El Camino Real (6-2) crawled within 63-40, Allen scored inside on a 
follow shot, slammed home a breakaway dunk and then tipped in an alley-oop lob 
to give Granada Hills a 69-42 lead with 3 minutes 35 seconds left in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
In other games: 
</P>
<P>
Grant 52, North Hollywood 42 -- North Hollywood (6-4) crept within 43-39 with 
3:21 remaining, but Grant's Jason Astor nailed a 15-foot jump shot to give the 
Lancers a six-point lead in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Brown (six points, seven assists) added a three-point shot to give Grant a 
48-39 lead with 2:10 left. 
</P>
<P>
Brunell Mori scored a team-high 13 points and added 16 rebounds to lead Grant 
(7-2), which has beaten North Hollywood twice this season. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda 76, Bell-Jeff 62 -- Junior swingman Marquis Burns scored 13 of his 
game-high 23 points in the second half to hold off a Bell-Jeff rally and lead 
the Regents (4-4) to the consolation title. 
</P>
<P>
A trio of Reseda players took turns carrying the team offensively. With the 
Regents leading, 45-36, at halftime, Burns scored seven of his team's 11 points 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
James Pigford added 19 points for Reseda, including 10 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Bennie Scott, who finished with 10 points, scored eight in the first quarter as 
the Regents took a 26-17 lead. 
</P>
<P>
James Chen had 12 points for Reseda. Brian Lee scored a team-high 19 for 
Bell-Jeff (4-5) and teammates Ignacio Castro (18) and Bob Machuca (12) also 
scored in double figures.

WILSON, MOORPARK EDGE VALLEY, 89-83 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was a classic Catch-22, but Valley College could define it as a problem 
catching 20. 
</P>
<P>
If the Valley defenders attempted to shut off Damian Wilson, No. 20 for 
Moorpark, he drove past them, and if Valley sagged, he hit from outside. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley players are on Christmas break, but Wilson took them back to school 
Saturday night with 18 points in the second half and 27 overall in an 89-83 
Moorpark victory at Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
The game between Western State Conference foes was not counted as a conference 
contest because the teams play in different divisions. 
</P>
<P>
"As soon as we started hitting from the outside and then going inside, they 
couldn't stop us neither way," said Wilson, who has been ill and did not start. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark trailed, 45-40, at halftime but ended the Monarchs' reign with an 
outside umbrella of Nate Hantgin, Sam Crawford and Wilson, who set up just 
beyond the three-point line. The outsiders took turns carrying the Moorpark 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
Crawford, who finished with 21 points and 11 assists, scored Moorpark's first 
seven points of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
A three-point shot by Crawford gave Moorpark its first lead, 54-53, at the 
14:55 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Hantgin soon followed with three consecutive three-point baskets within the 
space of a minute to push Moorpark's lead to 65-57. Hantgin scored a 
career-high 18 points and made five of eight three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson took control in the final 10 minutes, scoring 16 of Moorpark's final 22 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (14-2) needed the second-half surge to overcome a strong Valley 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
Playing without Rick Garrick, who had injured his ankle the night before, 
Valley (9-7) remained in the game until the final seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"Without our leader and everything, I thought we did a good job," Valley Coach 
Jim Stephens said. "We played a pretty good ball team and ran out of gas." 
</P>
<P>
Valley's Tory Stephens led all scorers with 29 points and grabbed eight 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Hall, Stephens' running mate at guard, made nine of 13 field goal 
attempts and scored 20. Russell Baldwin added 20 points and 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Stephens had a great game," Moorpark Coach Al Nordquist said. "They played 
extremely well in the first half." 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark had difficulty getting out of the blocks and away from Valley center 
Art Kirksey's blocks -- four in the first half alone. 
</P>
<P>
Although the gym temperature was up to normal by game time, the maintenance 
crew had turned off the heat earlier in the week when Moorpark adjourned for 
Christmas break. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark was a stone-cold 13 of 35 from the field and nine of 20 from the 
free-throw line before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
Valley, meanwhile, made 19 of 35 field-goal attempts and three of three free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark's Sean Doyle, starting at center in place of Aaron Smith who is home 
in Connecticut for Christmas, scored 12 points and grabbed 12 rebounds.

CAMPBELL HALL TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
MCKELLER LEADS HOST VIKINGS TO WIN IN FINAL 
</P>

<P>
When Alex Lopez announced he was going to enroll his 6-foot-10 freshman frame 
at Campbell Hall High last spring, it instantly raised eyebrows. 
</P>
<P>
Almost lost in that considerable shadow, however, was the transfer of Austin 
McKeller from St. Monica, a Division 5-AA semifinalist last season. 
</P>
<P>
McKeller, a junior guard, might have been overlooked then, but he grabbed his 
share of attention Saturday night, scoring 23 points to lead the Vikings to a 
79-58 win over South Bay Lutheran of Inglewood in the championship game of the 
Campbell Hall tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, he's the straw that stirs the drink," said Campbell Hall Coach Joe 
Jackson, whose team is off to its best start in school history at 9-0. 
</P>
<P>
South Bay Lutheran Coach Greg Rathke would have had a hard time arguing 
Jackson's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"He pretty much single-handedly dominated the game," Rathke said of McKeller. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez didn't exactly hurt the situation. He spent much of the game in foul 
trouble but still scored 15 points and blocked six shots. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings built a 36-21 halftime lead, but South Bay Lutheran (7-3) closed 
the margin to 41-33 midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
A reverse layup and two steals by McKeller and two nice feeds to Lopez put the 
game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
"He was directly responsible," Rathke said. "He's a real good player and they 
have some very good role players to go along with him." 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Williams fit into that category, coming off the bench for Campbell Hall 
to score 17 points. Forward Scott Glass spent much of the game accepting 
McKeller's passes and converting them into 12 points worth of layups. 
</P>
<P>
Marlon Henderson paced South Bay Lutheran with 17 points. Teammates Willie 
Williams and Phillip Morgan each scored 12. 
</P>
<P>
In the boys' consolation final: 
</P>
<P>
Whitney 63, Highland Hall 58 -- Edward Anastas scored 23 points, but Highland 
Hall (5-4) could not recover from a 40-20 halftime deficit. John Klejnot, who 
entered the game averaging 30 points and 13 rebounds a game for Highland Hall, 
was held to 11 points and 10 rebounds. He did block nine shots, however. 
</P>
<P>
Whitney (4-1) was led by Shaleen Desail with 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
In girls' games: 
</P>
<P>
Pasadena Poly 67, Campbell Hall 23 -- Things didn't work out quite as well for 
the Campbell Hall girls' team in its championship game. It was the 10th time 
this season that Pasadena Poly (11-0) has defeated an opponent by more than 20 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Kamilah Wells scored 22 points and tournament most valuable player Laurel 
Reichmann contributed 14. 
</P>
<P>
Joanna Paul of Campbell Hall (5-4) had seven points. 
</P>
<P>
Oakland Head Royce 72, Montclair Prep 23 -- Ten players scored for the Jayhawks 
(6-2) in the third-place game. 
</P>
<P>
Immaculate Heart 34, Oakwood 20 -- Erin Farrell scored 12 points for Oakwood 
but Immaculate Heart took the consolation championship.

A water-sports paradise in the summer and a retreat for snowbirds in the 
winter, the town of Parker, Ariz., has become an annual tournament stop for the 
Providence High boys' basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
For the past four Decembers, including an appearance last weekend, the Burbank 
school has been playing in the eight-team Parker tournament, and although they 
have yet to win more than one game in any tournament, the Pioneers have gained 
enriching experiences in the tiny hamlet alongside the Colorado River.

First, the team stays in a mobile home owned by the family of Coach Paul 
Sutton, affording the players a chance to interact in a social setting. 
</P>
<P>
Second, they always bring along Christmas gifts and donate them to the local 
Catholic church, which distributes them to needy Native American and Latino 
families. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not something that we make a big deal about," said Sutton, also the 
athletic director who is in his sixth season at Providence, a former parochial 
school for girls that competes in the Delphic League. 
</P>
<P>
"But it is a way for the kids to do something that's socially conscious. . . . 
We always show the kids the homes on the Indian reservations when we're down 
there, and they can't believe that people live under those conditions. It's an 
eye-opener for them." 
</P>
<P>
Note from the doctor: Officials recently ordered the Paraclete boys' basketball 
team to remove spandex leg shorts worn beneath their uniforms because of a 
National Federation of State High Schools Athletic Assn. rule. 
</P>
<P>
But according to Andy Gavel, Paraclete's coach, the regulation can be waived 
for medical reasons. 
</P>
<P>
Gavel has obtained a doctor's recommendation for the team to wear the shorts -- 
to keep their leg muscles warm, thus preventing injuries -- and plans to file 
it with the state CIF office. 
</P>
<P>
"That rule is completely idiotic," Gavel said. "It's a wacko reason to have a 
technical called and lose two points. They allow players to wear shirts 
underneath their uniforms. There is a medical reason to wear the shorts -- to 
prevent hamstring injuries. 
</P>
<P>
"They certainly don't wear them for appearance sakes."

Campbell watch: Jonathan Campbell was the workhorse in Poly High's improbable 
drive to the City Section 3-A Division football title. 
</P>
<P>
The senior running back gained a school-record 2,091 yards this season, an 
average of 149.4 yards a game. His numbers were even more impressive, however, 
during the Parrots' season-ending five-game winning streak, which culminated in 
a 28-8 victory over Lincoln in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell gained 865 yards (a 173-yard-per-game average) in 139 carries and 
scored eight touchdowns during the Parrots' winning streak. His lowest total 
during that stretch was 161 yards and his highest was 183. 
</P>
<P>
Add Campbell: The 5-foot-10 1/2, 180-pound Campbell, who gained 3,846 yards 
during his three-year career, ran for more than 100 yards in 10 of Poly's 11 
wins this season. His highest total in that category was 222 and his lowest was 
155. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, Poly's three losses occurred in games in which Campbell was 
held to fewer than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Add Poly: Three starters from the football team joined the basketball program 
last week, hoping to infuse the Parrots (2-19 last season) with their winning 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
So far, however, their addition has not made a difference. At least not in 
terms of wins and losses. 
</P>
<P>
The Parrots were 2-4 without the services of wide receivers Michael Vreeland 
(6-2) and Marlon McKinney (6-2). With them, they lost games to Granada Hills 
(95-55) and Reseda (66-47) in the North Hollywood tournament, and fell to 2-6. 
</P>
<P>
This season, Poly basketball Coach Jay Werner recruited juniors Vreeland and 
offensive lineman Francisco Flores (6-4), who will play at the junior-varsity 
level, and senior McKinney, who started at point guard on the junior varsity 
last season, is playing small forward for the varsity. 
</P>
<P>
Home-court advantage?: The fact that Reseda upset host Kennedy, 72-64, in a 
Northwest Valley Conference opener last week is surprising enough. But for 
Kennedy, the loss had to be upsetting for another reason. 
</P>
<P>
Sure, some call the free-throw line the charity stripe, but for Kennedy, there 
was no charity at all from the guys wearing stripes. 
</P>
<P>
In the second half, with the game still very much on the line, Reseda shot 14 
free throws to just one for the Golden Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
Reseda point guard James Chen made the most of his chances, making 12 of 13 
free throws, including 10 of 11 in the second half.

<P>
Cole and Santa Clara guard Art Barron were named to the all-tournament team. 
</P>
<P>
Matt Stebbers scored 14 points for Bishop Gorman (7-1) and was named the

<P>
The Moorpark College women's basketball team defeated Orange Coast, 99-73, in a 
nonconference game at Moorpark on Saturday night, the Raiders' school-record 
14th consecutive win. The previous mark was set during the 1986-87 season. 
</P>
<P>
Moorpark (14-1) is undefeated since losing its first game to defending state 
champion Golden West. 
</P>

"It was a really good win," Moorpark Coach Gary Abraham said. "The girls had 
the record on their mind and wanted to break it." 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore Kerrie Marshall scored a game-high 28 points, including 16 in the 
first half, to help Moorpark, ranked fourth in the state, to a 17-point 
halftime advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Four other Moorpark players scored in double figures: Amy Chandler (21), Lisa 
Huffaker (14), Jeny Shotliff (10) and Donna Houck (12). 
</P>

THE NHL; 
</P>
<P>
EXPANSION STIRS DEBATE OVER REALIGNMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The speeches were made, the vote was taken, results were tabulated and the 
decision was announced. 
</P>
<P>
But the campaign has just begun. 
</P>
<P>
When the NHL selected Ottawa and Tampa several weeks ago for the next round of 
expansion, it ended, at least for now, the hopes of cities from Hamilton, 
Canada, to Miami, and from Houston to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL will add the San Jose Sharks next season and the Tampa Lightning and 
Ottawa Senators in 1992-93 at a cost of $50 million to each expansion owner. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, the league has declared its desire to add four more teams by the 
turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
End of subject? 
</P>
<P>
Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
Because although the owners have decided which cities will have teams, they 
have just started the debate about which divisions they will play in. 
</P>
<P>
Does San Jose naturally go into the western-oriented Smythe Division? And Tampa 
into the eastern-based Patrick? 
</P>
<P>
Where does that leave Ottawa? 
</P>
<P>
Some club officials think that rather than merely shuffling the deck, this is a 
good excuse to break out a whole new pack of cards. 
</P>
<P>
King owner Bruce McNall and Chicago Blackhawk Vice President Bob Pulford are 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
Both would like to see a total realignment of the league, along American and 
Canadian lines. 
</P>
<P>
Under McNall's plan, the Kings and the Sharks would move to the Norris 
Division, giving them natural rivalries with Detroit, St. Louis and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto would move to the Smythe, where the Maple Leafs would face Canadian 
opponents Edmonton and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, there are the problems of going through customs all the time for 
all our teams," McNall said. "And there are no direct flights between a lot of 
these cities." 
</P>
<P>
That, of course, is not a problem for the Kings now that they have their own 
plane. But going from San Jose to Winnipeg on a winter's day can be the 
real-life equivalent of "Planes, Trains and Automobiles." 
</P>
<P>
When McNall introduced his plan at the NHL meetings in Florida, however, the 
chilly reaction could be felt all the way to Canada. 
</P>
<P>
Detroit doesn't want to play so many games in Los Angeles, where the three-hour 
time difference could hurt its telecasts. Toronto doesn't like losing its 
longtime rivalry with Detroit. Vancouver doesn't like losing the Kings and the 
Sharks, two clubs in its own time zone. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Pulford Plan, the league would go a step further and put the Patrick 
Division in the Campbell Conference with a Norris Division that would contain 
the Kings, creating an all-American conference. 
</P>
<P>
The Smythe Division under the Pulford Plan would add Montreal, Quebec and 
Ottawa, leaving only Toronto among the Canadian clubs to play in an American 
division. 
</P>
<P>
"To put Los Angeles in a division that has all Canadian clubs, the way it is 
now, is unfair," Pulford told the Chicago Tribune. "Los Angeles fans can't 
relate to rivalries against Canadian cities. They are used to U.S. city 
rivalries in other sports -- basketball, football, baseball. They want to see 
more of Boston, Chicago, Detroit and so on. 
</P>
<P>
"What happens to Los Angeles when (Wayne) Gretzky is finished playing? They 
must establish some rivalries with U.S. teams by playing them more." 
</P>
<P>
That's the same argument McNall uses when people wag their fingers at his plan 
and say the only reason he wants out of the Smythe is to get away from such 
tough rivals as Edmonton and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
"This proposal has nothing to do with the quality of play," McNall insisted. 
"That's short-sighted. Chicago and St. Louis might be better than Calgary and 
Edmonton in the future. 
</P>
<P>
"But we'd also have better rivalries. Over the long term, you'd build up 
rivalries with cities people are familiar with. 
</P>
<P>
"If you took the average (Los Angeles) hockey fan, and told him to go to a map 
and point out where Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver are, he might have some 
idea where Vancouver is. Other than that, he would have no idea." 
</P>
<P>
One problem with McNall's plan for realignment is that it seems premature. 
Putting together new divisions while the NHL is in the midst of a decade-long 
expansion plan is like betting on a roulette wheel. How can you be sure where 
it's going to stop? Why form a new division that may be as geographically 
ridiculous as those that now exist when still more new teams come in? Waiting 
until expansion is complete might be more sensible. 
</P>
<P>
"We might have a western division if we pick up a San Diego, or a Seattle, or a 
Texas," McNall acknowledged. "We might want to review it again then. 
</P>
<P>
"But, I think it's wrong to wait for what may never be. Or maybe the new teams 
will all end up on the East Coast. Or maybe this is the end of expansion for a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
League officials already promised Winnipeg it could switch to the Norris 
Division, a great move geographically for the Jets, when expansion became a 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
But with all these proposals being fired back and forth at the meetings this 
month, the only definite decision was to put the Sharks in the Smythe Division 
for next season. A committee was formed to study where to go from there. 
</P>
<P>
"We discussed every formula possible," McNall said. "The committee (which will 
include McNall) will consider any and all possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"The choices are anything from remaining the same and just adding the new teams 
to the present divisions to a variation on what I suggested to a complete 
realignment. We could go to conference play. Or we could set up three 
conferences with eight teams each. Whatever we decide, not everybody is going 
to be happy. 
</P>
<P>
"But, anything is possible. Make up anything you want, any formula you can 
imagine. Throw it up in the air and see whatever comes down. It's a whole new 
ballgame."

LOVE REPAIRS ADOPTIVE BABIES' RUINED LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Linda Darden smiled at the infant making gurgling sounds in the baby carrier 
balanced on the lap of her husband, Jim. 
</P>
<P>
"Hi, Danny," she cooed, patting the baby's long, dark hair. "What are you 
doing? Can you see me?" 
</P>
<P>
The 8-month-old infant, who suffered brain damage at birth and is thought to be 
a drug baby, appeared to look at Linda. 
</P>
<P>
"They don't even know if he's aware of his surroundings," she says. "I think 
he's aware, but I've had two doctors tell me that I'm wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Seated in the admissions office at Miller's Children's Hospital in Long Beach, 
the Anaheim couple had brought the baby in for tests to determine why he was 
choking on the special formula that must be fed to him through a gastrostomy 
tube in his stomach. 
</P>
<P>
As foster parents for "medically fragile" babies and babies whose mothers took 
drugs, the Dardens have made scores of trips to hospitals over the past eight 
years, usually in the middle of the night. 
</P>
<P>
The drug-addicted babies who share their home often require special medication 
to prevent seizures. Many have feeding, respiratory and sleep problems. And 
because they're going through withdrawal, they're often irritable and agitated. 
</P>
<P>
The medically fragile children arrive with special equipment such as oxygen 
tanks and apnea monitors that sound an alarm if they stop breathing. They also 
require special medication and constant supervision. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the difficulty in finding adoptive homes for these babies, they 
often spend years in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
While it's not unusual for a foster family to adopt one of these babies, the 
Dardens have adopted two drug babies within the past three years, and they 
recently obtained legal guardianship of a third drug-affected little girl whom 
they ultimately plan to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
All three girls have had serious medical problems. And because their biological 
mothers took drugs while they were pregnant, 5-year-old Priscilla, 3-year-old 
Jessie Sue and 2-year-old Becky have learning disabilities and face unknown 
future medical problems. 
</P>
<P>
But after providing at least two years of love and care for each child, the 
couple couldn't bear the thought of giving them up. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real hard to let go," Linda says. "The pain was too difficult." 
</P>
<P>
So at a time of their lives when their daughter is married and their son is in 
his senior year of high school, 43-year-old Linda and 45-year-old Jim Darden 
are raising three young girls, each with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to caring for the two infants: Danny and Joshua, a 
3-week-old drug baby. 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate everyone, the Dardens took out a second mortgage in order to add 
a second story to their Anaheim tract house, giving them four more bedrooms and 
a nursery off the new master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
For Linda Darden, who can't remember the last time she slept more than three 
hours at a stretch and never knows when the next medical crisis will occur, 
being mom to a houseful of children with special needs is not an imposition. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so fortunate that our two children were normal and that we never had a 
lot of trauma in our life," says Linda, who became a foster parent in 1972 
after an 18-month-old girl began showing up at her front door at 6 a.m. clad 
only in underpants. The girl's mother was never even aware she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there were other kids like her out there," she says. "I saw a great 
need and I wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
Linda began taking in medically fragile babies, many of whom were 
drug-addicted, in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"These are children who really need our help and we feel we can do that," she 
says. "I don't care if they're 18-hour screamers. I love to do what I do, and 
it's real easy for me to love them." 
</P>
<P>
Linda gazed down at Danny in the carrier on her husband's lap. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine anything worse than not being wanted and loved and needed in 
the beginning," she says. "And so when I take these babies, I feel I have 
something to offer them. If nothing else, I can give them a good start." 
</P>
<P>
The drug-addicted babies that Linda now cares for come through the Orange 
County Social Services Agency's Emergency Shelter Home Program, which provides 
short-term emergency shelter for abused, neglected or abandoned children until 
the courts decide what will happen to them. 
</P>
<P>
Since July, 1987, 536 newborn to 1-year-olds have gone through the Emergency 
Shelter Home Program; 85% to 90% were drug babies, with cocaine being the most 
frequently detected drug. 
</P>
<P>
The Darden family, one of nearly 50 in the program, has cared for seven 
drug-addicted babies over the past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
"Every one of those babies has a different need," says Linda, whose three girls 
illustrate some of the medical problems many drug-addicted babies experience as 
they grow up. (To assure confidentiality, the real names of Danny, Joshua and 
Becky have been changed.) 
</P>
<P>
It is not known what type of drugs Priscilla's biological mother took during 
pregnancy, but Priscilla had severe respiratory problems and required blood 
transfusions at birth. Eleven days after placement, Linda had to perform CPR on 
Priscilla after she stopped breathing. She has since had seizures, surgery to 
correct a serious stomach problem and has had to be fed through a G-tube. At 5, 
she has perceptual deficits and learning disabilities. "I have to remember that 
I have to repeat things to her several times," Linda says. 
</P>
<P>
Jessie Sue, whose biological mother was on cocaine, heroin and other drugs, 
came to the Dardens when she was 3 days old. "She had hepatitis, syphilis and 
severe (stomach) problems and had to be forced to eat," recalls Linda. Jessie 
Sue also has immune-system damage and has undergone two major surgeries and has 
had 23 gastrostomy tubes. Despite being the most medically damaged of the three 
girls, Linda says, Jessie Sue has the fewest neurological problems. 
</P>
<P>
Two-year-old Becky is a heroin baby who only recently was taken off an apnea 
monitor. While extremely bright, Becky has the expressive speech of a 
13-month-old. "So she's very frustrated and self-destructive," Linda says. "She 
does a lot of crazy things. She bangs her head and face on the wall. She 
doesn't listen at all, and she's real hyper." 
</P>
<P>
The three girls attend the Speech and Language Development Center in Buena Park 
full time and have made progress. 
</P>
<P>
But, "I think that it's going to be a long haul with all three of them," says 
Linda, who plans to take sign language classes to better communicate with 
Becky. 
</P>
<P>
Linda's "typical day" begins at 6 a.m. when she gives Danny his medication. 
While waiting the 20 minutes before she can begin feeding Danny via the G-tube, 
she feeds Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of the drug-affected babies have feeding and sucking problems because 
their little system is just so disorganized," she says, adding, however, that 
she spends more time with the medically fragile babies: "You're trying to 
stabilize them all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Linda, who is often up as late as 1 a.m. with one of the babies, wakes up 
several times a night for feedings. And she never knows when she'll have to 
respond to an apnea-monitor alarm. A year ago, she was getting up three or four 
times a night with Becky, who usually responded to light rubbing. 
</P>
<P>
Constantly dealing with such demanding infants undoubtedly takes a toll on even 
the most dedicated mother. 
</P>
<P>
"How it affects me is I thrive on it," Linda says. "I do really well in crisis 
situations and hospital situations." 
</P>
<P>
To give her a break, a licensed vocational nurse funded by the county comes in 
once a week to take care of Danny for four hours. And then there's Jim, who 
works for a welding-supply company. 
</P>
<P>
"Jim is wonderful with kids," Linda says. "He can G-tube as good as I can. He 
can bathe and change and wipe those little runny noses and do all the things 
that daddies can do." 
</P>
<P>
But Linda has other "helping hands": her parents, who moved in two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"If I need to be doing something and I've got one baby that needs to be 
attached to me, I can hand that baby to my mom and she takes over," says Linda, 
adding that she and her mother raise children alike -- except, she laughs, "she 
says I'm too easy." 
</P>
<P>
Linda's mother, Wilma Fink, said she never knew the extent of her daughter's 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
"She loves helping the babies," says Wilma. With a laugh, she added, "The only 
thing is she just can't adopt them all." 
</P>
<P>
The decision to adopt their first drug-affected baby, Priscilla, three years 
ago was not an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
"We never thought that we would adopt, and never in our wildest imaginations 
did we expect to have three more kids," Linda says. "It's just that when the 
adoption unit said it's time to find her an adoptive family, we had had her for 
three years and I said, 'No way. She has a family." 
</P>
<P>
Linda says she and Jim "laid awake a lot of nights trying to make that 
decision. We felt our kids were completely grown and very self-sufficient and 
were we ready to do this again? It was real fun to play house and be their mom, 
but to take them forever was real scary." 
</P>
<P>
But after that first time, she says, "it's a piece of cake. And if another baby 
would come into our life that would really desperately need a home, I don't 
know that we would not do it." 
</P>
<P>
Linda says it is difficult to find adoptive families for medically fragile 
children and drug-affected babies with medical problems. "If they have a lot of 
medical needs, the (potential adoptive) families aren't prepared for that and 
can't deal with that or just don't want to deal with that," she says. 
</P>
<P>
(Linda said they obtained legal guardianship of Becky rather than adopting her 
at this time because they need the continued financial assistance for the 
girl's extensive medical problems and special educational needs. As adoptive 
parents of medically fragile children, however, they receive financial help for 
Priscilla and Jessie Sue from the Adoptive Assistance Program, the amount of 
which is based on the child's needs and the family income.) 
</P>
<P>
She says she hasn't had much contact with the mothers of the babies. "For 
whatever reason, I happen to have the babies whose parents don't want the 
visits," she says. 
</P>
<P>
But as she sees it, such visits "are inappropriate. I mean, you know they're 
using (drugs). It's difficult to deal with them. It makes you angry. It makes 
you feel like, 'How dare you do this to this baby?' 
</P>
<P>
"But the other side of it is you know they have problems, too. They're trying 
to get their lives together and don't know how to do it. And here they have 
this beautiful baby and even having that baby couldn't help them to not use 
drugs. So it's a sad situation. It's almost a hopeless situation." 
</P>
<P>
Linda said her two older children were thrilled when she and Jim decided to 
adopt the girls. If there's one thing her children learned when she started 
taking in the medically fragile babies eight years ago, she said, it is 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
And now Priscilla, Jessie Sue and Becky are learning that same lesson. 
</P>
<P>
Linda said the three little girls often gather around Danny's crib "and they 
talk to him and they love him and they rock him and they pet him. He enjoys 
that." 
</P>
<P>
That, she said, is the difference between these babies spending their first 
months of life in a hospital or an institution where "they don't get a whole 
lot of nurturing and loving and care and the things they do at home. These 
babies do so much better in the home. Any of the drug babies do." 
</P>
<P>
Linda says she will always have at least one drug-addicted baby and one 
medically fragile baby in her home. And because of her parents' "helping 
hands," she said, she could take on even more. 
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have four little cradles," she said, giggling. "That's what 
I'm pushing for. Four little cradles. That would be wonderful."

IT'S NIP AND TUCK TO GET MENAGERIE IN SHAPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By CHARLES HILLINGER

<DATELINE>
<P>
PORTSMOUTH, R.I. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The elephant lost its trunk. The 16-foot-tall giraffe lost its head. 
</P>
<P>
Both injuries were the result of a 1954 hurricane that roared through this 
Rhode Island town. But don't worry: The elephant and giraffe recovered and are 
doing just fine. Unlike most other creatures, these animals can grow back any 
missing parts. 
</P>
<P>
They are members of the menagerie here at Green Animals, the oldest topiary 
garden in America. 
</P>
<P>
Topiary is the art of shaping shrubs and trees into geometric forms, ornamental 
designs, animals, birds, even humans. 
</P>
<P>
Green Animals, a seven-acre estate overlooking Narragansett Bay in Portsmouth, 
has 80 pieces of topiary scattered among the snapdragons, dusty millers, 
verbenas, marigolds, nasturtiums, zinnias, and other flowers and ornamental 
grasses. 
</P>
<P>
Here at Green Animals, gardeners have clipped, trimmed and pruned shrubs and 
trees into such shapes as tea cups, spirals, gumdrops, flower baskets, a 
policeman, a man on a horse, a bird bath, a trophy cup, a sail boat, a 
pineapple, an obelisk and an oversized, overstuffed chair. 
</P>
<P>
From the animal world, gardeners have created dogs, peacocks, reindeer, a boar, 
a donkey, a camel, a hen, a lion, an ostrich, a rooster, a swan, a unicorn, an 
alligator, a pig, the elephant, the giraffe and a big, round teddy bear. 
</P>
<P>
Green Animals was started in 1872 by the industrialist Thomas Brayton. His 
chief gardener from 1905 to 1945 was Joseph Carreiro, who was succeeded by his 
son-in-law, George Mendonca, who ran the gardens until 1985, when Ernie Wasson 
took over. 
</P>
<P>
Wasson, 40, is a transplanted Californian who received his degree in 
horticulture from Cal State Humboldt. 
</P>
<P>
"The biggest and best topiary gardens in America are here; Longwood Gardens, 
Pa.; Ladew Gardens, Md.; Disneyland, and Disney World," said Wasson, a former 
Longwood Gardens horticulturist. 
</P>
<P>
When Thomas Brayton died in 1939, his daughter, Alice Brayton, also a 
horticulturist, inherited the gardens. She owned and operated Green Animals 
until her death at age 94 in 1972. She left the gardens to the Preservation 
Society of Newport County, R.I., the organization that owns many of the famous 
old mansions of Newport. 
</P>
<P>
"Topiary gardens can be traced . . . to ancient Rome. Topiarius in Latin means 
garden. Pliny the Younger, who lived from 62 to 110 AD, had a famous topiary 
garden," Wasson said. 
</P>
<P>
"France has many topiary gardens. So does Italy, Japan, New Zealand and 
Australia. There's a cemetery in the Andes mountains of Ecuador that has 
topiary figures that are mind-boggling. A topiary garden in Thailand has a herd 
of elephants." 
</P>
<P>
But England remains the mecca of topiary gardens. "Almost every garden in 
England has topiary," said Wasson, who recently returned from a visit to 40 
topiary gardens in England and Scotland, including one that is 300 years old. 
In Great Britain, topiary gardeners are known as tree barbers. 
</P>
<P>
Walking through Green Animals with his trimmer in hand, Wasson stopped to prune 
Spot the dog and again to snip away at the ostrich. A self-described 
perfectionist, Wasson often visits zoos to study animals in order to achieve 
realistic shapes for his garden creations. 
</P>
<P>
All the figures here at Green Animals are crafted from growing California 
privet, yew and boxwood. 
</P>
<P>
"Slow-growing shrubbery is, of course, preferred," said Wasson with a grin.

FACE TO FACE WITH DRUG BABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS McLELLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not every newborn is tested for drugs and some do not initially show signs of 
drug exposure, so it is impossible to say how many drug babies are born each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"Hospitals are not legally mandated to report a positive toxicology screen, so 
we've always felt there was just a percentage that came to our attention," says 
Mary Harris, program analyst for the Orange County Social Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Cheryl Milford, assistant clinical professor of pediatrics at UC Irvine Medical 
Center, says most babies exposed to opiates, such as heroine and methadone, go 
through physiological withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
Babies exposed to stimulants such as cocaine and amphetamines may have tremors, 
feeding problems or sleeping problems, but do not go through a life-threatening 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
She says the majority of drug-exposed babies "probably are not going to show 
any significant difficulties like retardation. We don't know in terms of the 
more subtle things, like behavior problems or mild learning disabilities. 
Nobody's been able to follow them that far yet, but those studies are in 
progress right now, of which we are one." 
</P>
<P>
Social Services' Harris says some hospitals either have no protocol or they 
have varying policies for testing drug babies. "Or, they might test a baby and 
determine that things otherwise look OK," she says. "The hospital and the 
(mother's) doctor make the decision whether or not to test and what to do once 
they have tested." 
</P>
<P>
As required by law, an emphasis is placed on trying to keep the mother and baby 
together to maintain the parent-child relationship, she says. 
</P>
<P>
Harris says the services of a social worker are offered if the parents are 
cooperative and if it is determined that intervention will reduce the risk of 
abuse or neglect to the baby. 
</P>
<P>
The condition of the baby is also part of the decision-making process, Harris 
says. "It's difficult when we don't see all the symptoms right away, because 
then everyone is left not sure of what special needs the child will have." 
</P>
<P>
If it is determined that the baby would be at risk even with all available 
services to the parents, the social worker would ask for a legal order to 
prevent the hospital from releasing the baby. Harris says that any time Social 
Services places a hold on a baby, a detention hearing will be scheduled within 
48 hours. "If we wish to continue protective custody, we must file a petition 
(with juvenile court to give Social Services legal authority in the 
situation)." 
</P>
<P>
Harris says three things can then happen: "The court can dismiss our petition, 
they can return the baby to the parents and order us to supervise, or they can 
order the baby to be placed in foster care." 
</P>
<P>
Harris believes that the Perinatal Substance Abuse Act, legislation recently 
passed by the state, may have a negative impact on the number of drug babies 
reported to the Child Abuse Registry. 
</P>
<P>
The legislation says that a positive toxicology screen at the time of a baby's 
delivery is not in itself a sufficient basis for reporting child abuse or 
neglect. 
</P>
<P>
"So it places the responsibility of doing a more in-depth assesment -- of the 
mother's situation, of the child's special-care needs and the risk of neglect 
or abuse of the child -- on the hospital personnel," Harris says. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that if hospitals had been already spending the time to consider all 
the circumstances, that it (the legislation) should not make any difference. 
</P>
<P>
"But I'm concerned that other hospitals will not have the time or the interest 
to work with families on this and, as a result, they simply will not receive 
any services."

EXERCISE: SHAPING NEW MEN FROM THE OLD ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERRI KOBREN, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The assumption at the heart of the fitness revolution has always been that 
activity and proper diet are good for us when we are young and will help stave 
off disease and disabilities as we age. 
</P>
<P>
Now, proof that exercise is beneficial for older men is emerging from a 
federally funded research project -- known as "Fitness Over 50" -- that 
measures the physiological status of active seniors. 
</P>
<P>
"We clearly have people in the program over 70 with no evidence of heart 
disease," says Dr. Andrew Goldberg, professor of medicine at the University of 
Maryland and primary researcher in the project. "They have cardiac and 
metabolic profiles such that if I lined them up with 25-year-olds, I couldn't 
tell the difference." 
</P>
<P>
With volunteers who enter the program at various levels of fitness -- from 
top-level "masters athletes" down to couch potatoes -- the exercise emphasis 
has been on aerobic activities such as walking, biking and jogging. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only men have been studied, though the program will begin evaluating 
women in the next few months. Even on the men, all the data aren't in yet. But 
after about five years of study, many improvements have been documented. 
</P>
<P>
As the men become more active, their ability to use oxygen -- known as "VO-2 
max" -- increases. 
</P>
<P>
"This is probably the best test of overall well-being," Goldberg says. "You 
can't get a good result unless the muscles, heart and pulmonary system are in 
good shape, and glucose and fat are being utilized efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
"Our people go further on the treadmill; their exercise capacity is greater. 
One study shows an increase in cardiac blood flow. High-density lipoproteins go 
up. Triglycerides go down. Glucose metabolism increases: If you put a diabetic 
on a treadmill for half an hour, you can get the same decrease in glucose as 
with a shot of insulin." 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, psychological and neurological tests have shown that older men who 
exercise and lose weight are happier and more competent in daily activities 
than sedentary men who lose weight by dieting alone. 
</P>
<P>
At the University of Maryland, College Park, a companion study is trying to 
clarify the benefits of weightlifting in older men. 
</P>
<P>
Last April, Ben Hurley, director of the exercise physiology lab at College 
Park, recruited 14 men aged 50 to 69 who had not weight-trained for at least a 
year. Using weight machines, he trained them to move increasingly heavy loads: 
</P>
<P>
"So far, the average person has increased more than 100 pounds on the legs; the 
average increase in upper body power is 30 to 50%," Hurley says. "And from 
questioning them, we find there's no soreness." 
</P>
<P>
Muscle mass has also increased in the seven subjects analyzed so far, while the 
fat around the muscle and under the skin has decreased. 
</P>
<P>
In previous studies, Hurley found that strength-training leads to more 
efficient use of blood sugar, which reduces the risk of diabetes; since 
diabetes is a risk factor for heart disease, better glucose metabolism reduces 
the risk of heart disease as well. 
</P>
<P>
The current study expands and helps explain the former: Bigger muscles not only 
make you stronger and better looking, they may also make you healthier. 
</P>
<P>
While most formal studies of exercise and the elderly have concentrated on men, 
it is assumed that active women reap similar benefits in terms of heart health, 
diabetes prevention and control, and avoidance of weight gain. 
</P>
<P>
Heinz Lenz, 65, an assistant professor of physical education at the U.S. Naval 
Academy whose responsibilities include whipping plebes into shape, defines 
physical fitness in practical terms: 
</P>
<P>
"You are fit if you can carry out any physical task assigned to you or chosen 
by you," he says, ranging from taking out the trash, to jumping out of the way 
of a careening car, to enjoying your leisure. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to throw a football with the grandchildren. You should be 
able to take a relaxed bike ride with the grandchildren. You should be able to 
hit a tennis ball with the grandchildren -- though maybe you can't play 
competitively against them."

VOLUNTEERS PROVIDE FOOD BASKETS TO FEED THE NEEDY A HOLIDAY MEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nine years ago, college instructor Susan Silbert and some of her students held 
a raffle and raised enough money to provide about 70 Christmas dinners for 
needy families. 
</P>
<P>
Today, Silbert operates on a different scale. This morning, she and hundreds of 
volunteers plan to distribute 2,500 food baskets, which they hope will feed 
more than 12,000 needy people. 
</P>
<P>
On three evenings last week, she and her legion of helpers -- children, 
teen-agers, adults and senior citizens -- gathered in a hangar at Santa Monica 
Municipal Airport to sort and package food for the baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"This has grown not so much because the need has grown so significantly, but 
because more people want to give. And this provides an avenue for them to 
participate in something meaningful," Silbert said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, what began as a modest undertaking by a small group of classmates has 
blossomed into an incorporated nonprofit organization called One Voice with a 
network of hundreds of volunteers and year-round programs to help the 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew that the need did not just exist on Dec. 25," said Silbert, who is 
director of the group. "What happens is that when you do something, it grows." 
</P>
<P>
Silbert, who grew up in Brentwood and now lives in West Los Angeles, said her 
group has provided an avenue for participation, particularly for affluent 
people. 
</P>
<P>
"Being rich doesn't mean you don't care," she said. "It's just that people 
don't know how to help. I think people find meaning in their lives by helping 
others." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the volunteers participate in the group's collection and distribution 
of Christmas food baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The group pays for some of the food and supplies, but the majority of it is 
donated. 
</P>
<P>
Jack Berlin, whose company, Potato Sales, provides One Voice with produce, has 
been involved with the group since the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
"I never saw so much enthusiasm as I saw in Susan," Berlin said. 
</P>
<P>
The scene Wednesday night inside the chilly, cavernous hangar -- the use of 
which was donated by its owner, Judy Barker -- was reminiscent of Santa's elves 
preparing for Christmas: Volunteers, bundled up in coats and scarves, busily 
worked in groups of five to eight around portable tables. The sounds of 
Christmas songs blared in the background as some sang along. 
</P>
<P>
Each food basket distributed today contains a turkey, canned food, fresh 
vegetables, fruits and pies. 
</P>
<P>
Silbert said that as the number of people being served has grown, she and her 
helpers have made a special effort to keep the quantity of food generous and 
the quality high. 
</P>
<P>
"We treat these people like our own families," she said. "You don't put family 
at the end of the table and give them crummy food. We provide top-quality 
food." 
</P>
<P>
As he sorted and packed the food Wednesday night, Ray Michaud, headmaster of 
the private John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air, said he has been a volunteer for 
five years and got his school involved four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something for a hands-on, concrete experience for our kids," 
he said as he placed yams in a bag with the assistance of his son and other 
students from the school. "This provides that, and I think they love it. This 
is an experience in unconditional love." 
</P>
<P>
At another table, Mary Sidell and her daughter, Devin, 10, were packaging 
oranges. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteering, Sidell said, gives children a chance to see first-hand that there 
are others less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not in the realm of their everyday experiences," she said. "That's why 
it's important that they know there is a need out there." 
</P>
<P>
"I want to help the homeless," Devin said. 
</P>
<P>
Tanya Lopez, a talent agent who was one of Silbert's original students and who 
is now on the board of directors of One Voice, said her participation provides 
balance in her life. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a real touchstone for me," she said. "This reminds me of what is 
really important in the world. People are searching for something to do to make 
the world a better place to live. You just have to give them a little 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
Silbert, a former sociology teacher who had taught at several area colleges, 
began her fund-raising and food collection efforts out of her West Los Angeles 
home as a year-round emergency aid program, responding to requests from area 
social workers. 
</P>
<P>
She started with a few Head Start programs serving the inner-city area and 
began providing Christmas dinners to families of Head Start students, all of 
whom fall below the federal poverty level (which now is an annual household 
income of $12,700 for a family of four). 
</P>
<P>
She incorporated her program in 1982, and opened an office in Santa Monica. She 
now has an annual budget of $100,000 -- all through private donations -- and a 
paid staff of five. 
</P>
<P>
Silbert said she has funds only to last through June, and for the first time 
will have to concentrate on fund-raising. But for now, she is focused on 
distributing the Christmas food baskets. 
</P>
<P>
"This is more than just giving them food, we give them hugs," she said. "If the 
families we are giving food to have not been hugged four or five times by the 
volunteers, then we feel we failed."

AMID RUINS OF FIRE, RESIDENTS REBUILD LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
DISASTER: A YEAR AFTER THE WORST BUILDING BLAZE IN THE 104-YEAR HISTORY OF THE 
LOS ANGELES FIRE DEPARTMENT, RESIDENTS OF WILSHIRE HIGH-RISES ARE STILL TRYING 
TO COPE WITH THEIR LOSSES.

<P>
Shocked awake by the boom of an explosion, the whoosh of giant flames and the 
rattle of airborne embers on her window, Dana Maltz realized that it was too 
light for half-past three in the morning at the dark end of December. 
</P>
<P>
Peeking down through the blackout curtains, she saw that the wooden frame of 
the uncompleted Devonhill condos next door was consumed in flame, roaring up at 
her like the world's biggest bonfire. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't see flames like I thought flames would look like," Maltz said. "It 
was just a solid yellow-orange." 
</P>
<P>
What she saw one year ago today from her bedroom window halfway up the Wilshire 
Terrace, a high-rise co-op on the eastern edge of Westwood, was the start of 
the worst building fire in the 104-year history of the Los Angeles Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
A watchman at the five-story construction site called in an alarm at 3:37, but 
a warm, 8- to 10-m.p.h. wind from the northeast was already fanning the 
original arson blaze and blowing it against the eastern wall of the Wilshire 
Terrace, a 14-story luxury building with 106 residents home at the time of the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
Caught underneath the large terraces that cover the side of the structure, the 
flames flashed into the core of the building through air-conditioning ducts and 
were belching from the windows of apartments on 12 of the 14 floors when 
firefighters arrived five minutes after the first alarm. 
</P>
<P>
The wind hurled burning timbers to the roof of the Devonshire, an 18-unit 
apartment house on the east side of Devon Avenue, to a construction site on the 
south side of Wilshire Boulevard and to apartment houses on the next block. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember saying that there had to be an airplane crash, because of the 
amount of fire all around," said Fire Capt. Louis Chatin, commander of one of 
the first companies to arrive on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
With the fickleness of airborne currents, the wind flung firebrands to the 
wood-shingle roofs of houses in a block-wide swath that stretched for a mile 
and a half. 
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately, we were not at home. Had we been, the man across the street said 
we'd have never gotten out of there," said Luana Lagerson, whose house on 
Holmby Drive was a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
The neighbor, who was wetting down his own roof with a garden hose, watched a 
ball of fire come down from the sky and come to rest in a rain gutter on 
Lagerson's house. 
</P>
<P>
"The roof was so dry that the whole thing started on fire in 10 seconds, and 
then the gas line exploded," Lagerson said. 
</P>
<P>
The Lagersons, who had lived in the house for 40 years, managed to salvage a 
scorched family Bible but little else, said their son, Doug. 
</P>
<P>
In all, there were 33 separate fires -- 28 buildings and five trees; so many 
that dispatchers found it hard to keep track of them all, said Deputy Fire 
Chief Donald F. Anthony, who was the commander at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, the department ended up assigning two-thirds of its resources 
to the high-rise, frustrating homeowners who reported their roofs on fire only 
to be told that there was no one available. 
</P>
<P>
But the decision to concentrate on the high-rise still seems correct, Anthony 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, the potential for the highest life loss and greatest damage was the 
Wilshire Terrace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Four hundred and six firefighters and 58 command and supporting officers were 
sent to the scene from stations as far away as San Pedro, along with 69 fire 
engines, six rescue ambulances and five helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
The heat from the flames at the Devonshire was so intense that a firetruck had 
to be pulled back when its side panels started burning. 
</P>
<P>
Inside the Wilshire Terrace, where security guards called apartments and 
knocked on doors to roust the largely elderly residents, "it was real dark, 
real hot, real smoky and real difficult to get to the fire," Chatin said. 
</P>
<P>
There were 87 units in the building, many of them enlarged by tearing down 
walls to combine two original apartments, and customized with extra-heavy doors 
that the firefighters found hard to chop through. 
</P>
<P>
The air was so hot that their leather helmet shields melted, and "aluminum 
(which melts at 1,150 degrees) was pouring everywhere," Chatin said. 
</P>
<P>
Even the water from the fire hoses posed a danger, heated to near-boiling 
temperatures and flooding the corridors of the high-rise because the concrete 
floors and ceilings gave it nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
Already loaded down with 32-pound breathing apparatuses, the firefighters 
lugged 600 five-pound air cylinders up the stairs, each good for 20 to 30 
minutes inside the inferno. 
</P>
<P>
Snaking their hoses up the stairwells, they made dogged progress, but dawn 
breezes kicked up the blaze again. The fire was finally declared out at 7:43 
a.m. A third of the luxury units had been destroyed, another third suffered 
serious damage, and the rest had smoke damage. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a bronze statue that was completely melted," said Chuck Maltz, Dana's 
husband and president of the building's board of directors. He said his Army 
dog tags survived, however. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider that no one was injured on the night of fire, that, in 
itself, was a miracle, and it gives a recommendation to the great training the 
(building) staff had in getting people out," Maltz said. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep a list of people at the switchboard, and we know who's in town and 
not," he said. "Our security people were able to wake up people who didn't hear 
their smoke alarms. They were truly heroes that night. And the Fire Department 
did things I didn't believe human beings could do." 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, the Fire Department made a preliminary estimate that damage to all 
the buildings and homes in the area totaled $17 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Bob Corbin, managing executive general adjuster for CNA Insurance Co., one 
of more than 15 carriers stuck with the bills, says that total claims were 
recently estimated at $400 million, much of it in furs, jewelry and fine art. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the Wilshire Terrace's more famous residents included actress Greer 
Garson, who was out of town at the time of the fire, and film director Billy 
Wilder, who had sold much of his famous collection of paintings and sculpture 
only weeks before. Others were not as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
Except for a case or two of smoke inhalation, no one was physically hurt. But 
the psychic wounds, and in some cases the financial burden on those who did not 
have enough fire insurance, have been overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
"The average loss was probably $1.5 million in coverage," said Arnie Abramson, 
a public insurance adjuster whose firm represented 15 Wilshire Terrace 
residents. Some of them suffered losses in excess of $3 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife was very depressed for quite a while," said Dr. Ralph Bookman, a 
Wilshire Terrace resident who fled in bathrobe, shorts and slippers. The couple 
lost a rare book collection worth several hundred thousand dollars, fur coats 
and virtually everything else in their apartment. "It really gets to you. When 
you lose your home, you don't realize what it's like until you lose it," said 
Bookman, an allergist whose patients include former President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
By now, most people are over the shock, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the fire, many Wilshire Terrace residents have been living in nearby 
apartments, with rent of as much as $10,000 a month covered by insurance. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a year now. If you can't come out of it by now you should quit," Bookman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"We all feel stronger for having each other," Dana Maltz said. "I think if we 
were living in a house that burned, we'd feel more alone. But having so many 
people in the same boat, we kind of get encouragement from each other." 
</P>
<P>
One year later, residents and fire officials are still dealing with the causes 
and consequences of the conflagration that the Fire Department simply calls the 
Wilshire-Devon fire, Incident No. 150: 
</P>
<P>
* After a year of cleanup, reconstruction and installation of an elaborate 
alarm and sprinkler system, 15 residents of the Wilshire Terrace have moved 
furniture into apartments on the western end of the building, which suffered 
only smoke damage. On Thursday, they received permission from the city to move 
back in. Apartments on the east end will not be ready until at least mid-1991. 
</P>
<P>
* Fire Department investigators have determined that the original fire at the 
Devonhill was arson. "We've chased down every lead and haven't been able to 
name a suspect," Los Angeles Fire Marshal Davis R. Parsons said. 
</P>
<P>
* The developers of Devonhill, having first planned to start over with their 
original design, have decided to use steel studs instead of wood beams this 
time. Still awaiting city permits to go ahead, they have missed the height of 
the real estate boom and are still paying interest on their financing. "We are 
really a big victim of the fire," said J.P. Chavy, president of the Devonhill 
Associates development firm. 
</P>
<P>
* The ruins of the Devonshire have been fenced off, but its open walls and 
gaping roof stand in mute testimony to the ferocity of the blaze. Elenore 
Heller, the owner, did not respond to a request to comment on her plans for the 
site, which suffered damages estimated at $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
* The Lagersons of Holmby Drive are rebuilding, this time with a fire-resistant 
roof. "Be sure your insurance covers replacement cost," Luana Lagerson advises 
other homeowners. Hers did. 
</P>
<P>
The Fire Department, although proud of its work, has also learned a few lessons 
from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a next time, says Deputy Fire Chief Anthony, companies from nearby 
cities like Beverly Hills, Culver City and West Hollywood will be thrown 
immediately into the fray, not sent off to fill in at far-away Los Angeles 
stations. 
</P>
<P>
And new procedures have been set up to try to keep better track of far-flung 
flames, he said.

spread the blaze more than a mile downwind. In all, there were 33 separate 
fires -- 28 buildings and five trees -- so many that dispatchers had trouble 
keeping track of them all. On the anniversary of the blaze, some of the people 
who escaped or fought the fire look back on a morning they'll never forget. J1

DINER REFUSES TO SELL OUT; 
</P>
<P>
DEVELOPMENT: AMID MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS IN THE SOUTH WESTWOOD 
AREA, THE APPLE PAN HOLDS ON TO ITS TRADITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
A landmark Pico Boulevard diner, dwarfed by giant development projects around 
it, has proven it's no flash in The Apple Pan. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1947, the purveyor of hickory burgers and homemade apple pie has been 
serving up grub to devotees who make pilgrimages from far and wide to hop up on 
one of the 26 red stools for a bite to eat. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Martha Gamble says The Apple Pan is going to continue to embrace history, 
not fool with it. It stands as a monument to no-growth amid a profusion of 
stucco and steel, attesting that some things can stay the same. 
</P>
<P>
When developers came to call several years ago, Gamble shooed them away, 
despite the "wild numbers" being bandied about. 
</P>
<P>
"We weren't even slightly interested because we like our little place," Gamble 
said. "We don't know what we'd do without it." 
</P>
<P>
The unassuming little white-frame restaurant looks like the plain, but proud, 
country cousin to its looming neighbor across the street -- the jazzy Westside 
Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
And soon it will be the only piece of property in its entire block that is not 
part of a two-story retail enclave under construction at Westwood and Pico 
boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the 105,000-square-foot Pavilion expansion down the street will 
soon add its presence to the rapidly developing South Westwood area. 
</P>
<P>
Although the restaurant is a paean to the common person, it gets its share of 
celebrities. Chrysler chief Lee Iacocca stopped in recently, and Laker Magic 
Johnson is a regular, Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
It's by design, not accident, that The Apple Pan is almost exactly like it was 
when Gamble's parents, Alan and Ellen Baker, opened its doors in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
There are no fancy computer checks -- actually, no computers at all -- in the 
tiny back office stacked with supplies. The adding machine with a big 
hand-crank is a relic of days gone by. 
</P>
<P>
Employee pay records are kept on loose ledger sheets, and the bulky black safe 
looks as if it came right out of a '20s gangster movie. Gamble warms herself by 
the same ancient space heater her father, now retired, used when she was a 
girl. 
</P>
<P>
"It's never been a fancy operation," Gamble said. "We concentrate a lot on what 
we do, but no frills. . . . I can't think of a thing that's changed since 
1947." 
</P>
<P>
Well, there is one thing. The Apple Pan was one of the few places that refused 
to give up tiny, individual glass bottles for the thick whipping cream it 
serves with coffee. Then a few years ago, the restaurant couldn't buy them 
anymore, despite contacting manufacturers all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
Now The Apple Pan has gone plastic, and Gamble says her father still laments 
that he didn't stockpile a lifetime supply of the thick glass beakers in his 
garage. He retired several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The metal holders for paper water cups are the next endangered tradition, 
Gamble said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble remembers how before the restaurant opened both her grandmothers spent 
time in the kitchen working out the pie recipes that are still followed to the 
letter for the 100 pies baked daily. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble and her parents used to stay in Los Angeles in the winter, then return 
for the summer to Chicago, where her father was a golf pro. 
</P>
<P>
When the family moved West permanently in 1961, they took over full-time 
management of the restaurant. Gamble's daughter has followed her mother into 
the family business. 
</P>
<P>
One of the more unusual things about The Apple Pan is the loyalty of its 
employees. Cook-manager Charles Collins has worked there since 1956. Waiter 
Gordon Teske has been on board since 1964. And they aren't the only ones, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
The customers are equally attached to the place. "It's almost a cult," Gamble 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Gamble said she is on good terms with the firm that is developing the shopping 
center next door. 
</P>
<P>
Spokeswoman Wendy Sommerstein said developers Eliot &amp; Michael Lewis knew 
they were dealing with a landmark and, despite having high-end tenants in the 
new development, found it a plus to be a neighbor of the historic little diner. 
The center is set for completion in June. 
</P>
<P>
"We go there all the time for the coffee," Sommerstein said.

TRAFFIC PORTION OF CRA'S HOLLYWOOD RENEWAL PLAN DRAWS FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: SOME RESIDENTS SAY THE PLAN IS TOO VAGUE. WEST HOLLYWOOD 
MERCHANTS SAY IT WILL MERELY SHOVE PROBLEMS INTO THEIR CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency's newly released plans to deal 
with the revitalization of Hollywood Boulevard and the movie capital's chronic 
traffic problems are encountering criticism from near and far. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, several Hollywood residents told the agency's Board of Commissioners 
that its proposals to deal with the transportation and urban design components 
of the CRA's $922-million redevelopment effort are too vague and do not give 
enough attention to some of their specific concerns. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, West Hollywood merchants and city officials have expressed concern 
that the CRA is trying to fix Hollywood's traffic problems by dumping them into 
their city's lap. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Hollywood residents -- most of whom are activists already 
critical of the CRA -- were made Thursday at the second of two public hearings 
on the proposals, officially known as the Hollywood Boulevard District Urban 
Design Plan and Hollywood Transportation Plan. 
</P>
<P>
Once adopted, the urban design and transportation plans will become key 
elements in the redevelopment effort, CRA officials say. The public suggestions 
offered during the two hearings and in letters will be sent along with the 
proposals to the CRA board, and then to the City Planning Commission within 
about 60 days, said CRA spokesman Marc Littman. 
</P>
<P>
After the city planners make suggestions, the plans will go back to the CRA 
board for approval, and ultimately the formal drafts will go back to the Los 
Angeles City Council for its final approval. Following the entire review and 
revision process, the plans are expected to be ready for adoption next year. 
</P>
<P>
At Thursday's hearing and in interviews afterward, several members of the 
now-defunct Hollywood Project Area Committee complained that the proposals fail 
to take into account many issues that they have been raising for years. 
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed mostly of elected citizens, was the official advisory 
group for the CRA's 30-year redevelopment effort until Los Angeles City 
Councilman Michael Woo replaced it last year, saying the group had become a 
"forum for wacky behavior." 
</P>
<P>
The Project Area Committee still meets, and has submitted several detailed 
criticisms of the two plans, saying they are too vague and do "not come 
anywhere near the required document . . . promised to the community." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, redevelopment "will continue to be attempted in a vague, shifting 
and confusing environment," the group said in an open letter. 
</P>
<P>
Doreet Hakman, a committee member who represents the new Hollywood Boulevard 
Community Council, told the board Thursday that the plans make unspecific 
promises about housing and parking, but leave out important details such as 
whether much-needed family housing would be included and exactly what kinds of 
parking could be provided. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like the fact it has no teeth to it," Hakman said. "The language is so 
vague." 
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Hakman complained that by limiting public speakers to three 
minutes apiece, the CRA was sending the message that it cares little about 
input from local citizens and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel that one more time, we the community have been left out," said Hakman, 
who runs Snow White's Coffee Shop on Hollywood Boulevard. "This plan has no 
specific language, no assurances that the community will get all the things we 
asked for during all those meetings we went to over the past few years." 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Epstein, a Hollywood businessman who belongs to the Project Area 
Committee and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, described his feelings about 
the proposals as mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein told the board that he continues to oppose the CRA policy of invoking 
eminent domain to displace tenants when rebuilding Hollywood. He also said 
Hollywood needs an underpass at the intersection of Franklin and Highland 
avenues to mitigate the already severe traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be terribly expensive," he said, "but sometime it'll have to be done. 
It should be incorporated into the (transportation) plan today." 
</P>
<P>
Some residents also have criticized the CRA's plans to make Cahuenga Boulevard 
and Wilcox Avenue one-way streets to help mitigate the expected crush of 
traffic going through Hollywood once the renewal effort gets under way. 
</P>
<P>
In behalf of merchants, the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has expressed concern 
as well, saying the one-way streets could hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
Others said the CRA needs to take a regional approach to transportation 
problems and cooperate with other city, county and state transportation and 
planning agencies. 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the CRA, Hollywood resident William Flatley said: "Sick transit 
systems won't be made healthy by Metro Rail; sicker highway problems won't be 
cured by adding another lane to Franklin Avenue. Local transportation plans are 
certainly important; regional solutions are imperative." 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood officials, residents and merchants also have criticized the CRA 
for failing to take a more regional outlook. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood's transportation manager, Lucy Dyka, said in a letter to CRA 
Chairman Jim Wood that there are inconsistencies between the CRA's 
transportation plan and other regional plans such as the Air Quality Management 
Plan, Regional Mobility Plan and Congestion Management Plan being formulated by 
state and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
Dyka also said the CRA "should consider whether its proposals will be 
consistent" with recommendations from the Tri-Cities Transportation Improvement 
Project, a joint undertaking by the cities of Beverly Hills, Los Angeles and 
West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of several West Hollywood restaurants on and near Santa Monica Boulevard 
also have complained to Wood that the CRA's idea of mitigating transportation 
is to send it all west, across the border into West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"The plan to improve the situation in Hollywood requires dumping the problems 
into West Hollywood," restaurateur Mary Sweeney said in a letter to the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
West Hollywood officials are primarily concerned with the CRA's plans to widen 
Santa Monica Boulevard and turn it into a "super street" in which large volumes 
of traffic would be allowed to flow east and west by limiting turns off the 
road and synchronizing traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
Some of those efforts already have been downgraded due to concerns expressed by 
West Hollywood leaders, said Donald Spivack, the CRA's operations director 
overseeing the Hollywood project. 
</P>
<P>
"But they are still concerned," Spivack said, "so we'll have to sit down with 
the (Los Angeles) city traffic department, the state and West Hollywood 
officials and investigate what options might be possible to meet the traffic 
requirements of both communities." 
</P>
<P>
Major components of the draft transportation plan include upgrading roads, 
improving traffic flow while mitigating its effects on neighborhoods, expanding 
and improving public transit and reducing the adverse effects of proposed Metro 
Rail subway construction.

SURVEY FINDS SUPPORT FOR TRASH TRAINS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: RESEARCHERS FIND A WILLINGNESS AMONG SAN GABRIEL VALLEY 
RESPONDENTS TO FUND AGGRESSIVE REFUSE DISPOSAL AND POLLUTION CONTROL MEASURES. 
</P>

<P>
San Gabriel Valley residents favor aggressive measures to solve the region's 
trash and pollution problems, even if they have to pay for them, a new survey 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
A study released last week by Claremont McKenna College's Rose Institute for 
State and Local Government shows that 40% of residents surveyed favored a 
proposal for trains to haul garbage to the desert. 
</P>
<P>
The random phone survey of 800 households in 32 cities, from Alhambra to 
Pomona, showed that concern for the environment is much stronger than 
researchers had expected, according to public opinion pollster Mark Baldassare, 
who helped with the study and announced the results along with Rose Institute 
officials during a Baldwin Park news conference. 
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that San Gabriel Valley residents of all socioeconomic, 
educational and ethnic backgrounds are "willing to make efforts that I can't 
imagine that people in the 1960s or 1970s would have made," Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, 55% said they were willing to set up their own compost system to 
deal with yard clippings. Also, nine out of 10 said they would recycle paper, 
glass and metal from their residences, and four out of five favored penalties 
for those who refuse to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
More than half said air pollution is the most pressing problem faced by the San 
Gabriel Valley. Twelve percent said waste disposal is most important; 10% 
responded "other"; 7% said they were unsure; 6% said pollution in general, and 
5% indicated water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
In a separate question on ground water contamination, 31% strongly agreed that 
it is a major threat in the San Gabriel Valley, another 43% somewhat agreed, 
17% didn't know or didn't answer, 8% disagreed, 1% strongly disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Institute senior researcher Alan Heslop interpreted these results by 
saying: "Seventy-plus percent think there is a major threat in the form of 
ground water pollution. You have an issue here that is going to have a lot of 
life to it and perhaps a lot of fury for some time to come." 
</P>
<P>
He linked concern over the region's widespread ground water pollution to the 
fact that only 20% of those surveyed said they favor disposing of their trash 
in local landfills, which some environmentalists and politicians say represents 
a threat to drinking water supplies. About 28% favored trash incineration. 
</P>
<P>
Politicians and pollsters alike said they were amazed at the high percentage 
favoring the rail plan over the use of local landfills or trash incineration. 
Tom Harvey, the La Verne mayor pro tem who heads the solid waste committee of 
the San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Cities, said "the study is an excellent 
endorsement of what we are doing." 
</P>
<P>
Local, regional and county officials have been working with two major trash 
disposal companies on separate proposals that call for hauling Los Angeles 
County trash to remote desert sites in Riverside and San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
The results also pleased Gary E. Kovall, senior vice president of the Eagle 
Mountain Project of the Mine Reclamation Corp., which is planning the Riverside 
County waste-by-rail venture. "I believe this shows people will pay a premium 
for environmental protection," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Of those who favored the rail plan, 54% said they would pay an extra $20 
monthly to meet additional disposal costs for the trash trains. Thirty-two 
percent said they favored paying only an additional $5 to $10 beyond their 
monthly cost, which now averages $8 to $12 throughout the region. 
</P>
<P>
Harvey estimated the rail project would cost about $6 a month extra per 
household. 
</P>
<P>
Another surprise to researchers and area politicians was that respondents in 
the survey seemed unafraid of having trash transfer stations located in their 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
Some 85% indicated they would be willing to have such a facility in or near 
their city. Harvey said, "This supports the notion that it's not as volatile a 
political issue as we thought." 
</P>
<P>
The study was funded by Claremont McKenna through an endowment to the Rose 
Institute, and officials pointed out that no money for the research was 
provided by the waste hauling industry. The statistical margin for error for 
the survey was plus or minus three percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Institute officials also plan to survey residents of San Bernardino and 
Riverside counties about their attitudes toward accepting trash from the San 
Gabriel Valley and the rest of Los Angeles County.

JURY ACQUITS DEFENDANT IN FATAL SHOOTING; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: LAST SUMMER'S DRIVE-BY SHOOTING IN NORTHWEST PASADENA KILLED ONE 
22-YEAR-OLD MAN AND SENT ANOTHER TO COUNTY JAIL FOR FIVE MONTHS. THE ONE-WEEK 
TRIAL REVOLVED AROUND THE CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY OF WITNESSES. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It may have seemed like just another drive-by shooting on a hot summer night in 
Northwest Pasadena, but the mothers of both victim and suspect were left 
wondering what their sons did to deserve such a fate. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, a Pasadena Superior Court jury ended the anguish for one of the 
women. The other was left with the knowledge that her son's killer -- whoever 
he may be -- is walking free. 
</P>
<P>
Jurors deliberated less than an hour before acquitting Michael Peterson, 22, of 
Monrovia. Police said he had gang connections, but his mother denied it. 
</P>
<P>
He was freed Thursday after spending five months in County Jail, where he had 
been held in lieu of $100,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
"I seen my life as being gone," said Peterson, adding that he plans to move out 
of the area, study computer programming and spend time with his 6-month-old 
son. "Now I've been given a life back." 
</P>
<P>
Peterson was accused of killing Jimmy Wilburn, 22, on July 22, as Wilburn sat 
with some friends in front of a suspected gang hangout on Del Monte Street. 
Police said Wilburn, too, had gang affiliations, but his mother also denied any 
ties. 
</P>
<P>
The murder was one of nearly 500 homicides in Los Angeles County attributed to 
gang members since the beginning of the year. But its toll on the mothers of 
Peterson and Wilburn was anything but routine. 
</P>
<P>
"We were in prison, too," said Sherry Peterson, 48, who had insisted from the 
beginning that her son was innocent. "It's terribly frustrating when you know 
something is wrong, but you have no control over it." 
</P>
<P>
Wilburn's mother, Alice Rhodes, said she was not surprised by the verdict, but 
remains convinced of Peterson's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
"He had a very, very good lawyer," said Rhodes, 45. "But I still know he killed 
my son. . . . I guess I can't prove it. It's just my instinct." 
</P>
<P>
The one-week trial revolved around the contradictory testimony of several 
witnesses, who police said identified Peterson as the shooter. However, in 
court, they denied having done so. 
</P>
<P>
Officers attributed the discrepancy to the witnesses' fear of being labeled a 
snitch, which is often considered a death sentence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a constant problem," Lt. Van Anthony said. "(Peterson) is going free 
because . . . basically, the witnesses were afraid to testify." 
</P>
<P>
But Peterson's attorney successfully poked holes in the police investigation. 
He argued that the witnesses who implicated Peterson did so under coercion from 
investigators and could not possibly have seen his face on the dimly lighted 
street. 
</P>
<P>
"In July, on a late night on a dark street, someone yelled out the words: 'That 
looks like Michael Peterson's car,' " his attorney, Guy O'Brien, told the jury. 
"That got twisted and transformed to: 'That is his car, that is Michael 
Peterson.' 
</P>
<P>
"The police did not investigate the facts," O'Brien said. "They exploited that 
rumor into a formal murder charge." 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Stephen Lee contended that Peterson had acted like a guilty 
man when he lied to detectives by telling them he had been with a female friend 
in Los Angeles on the night of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
"When Michael Peterson lied, he was hiding something," Lee said. "He was hiding 
the fact that he was there (on Del Monte Street)." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien conceded that Peterson should not have lied, but said that the 
defendant had been fearful of the investigators and could not recall where he 
had been. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Peterson said he remembered that he had been home that night. His mother 
and sister backed his alibi. 
</P>
<P>
"The only way for the police to get off their butts and catch the killer is for 
Michael Peterson to be acquitted in this case," O'Brien said.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? POMONA HOPES A LITTLE LESS CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE WARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of Pomona's most notorious street gangs may be in for an identity crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Some city officials want to rename 12th Street -- birthplace of the 300-member 
12th Street gang -- Cabrillo Street, after 16th-Century explorer Juan Rodriguez 
Cabrillo. 
</P>
<P>
They say the change, which the City Council will consider at a public hearing 
Feb. 4, would remove the gang stigma for law-abiding 12th Street residents, and 
might also reduce violence on the street, where two youths were killed by gangs 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
Councilwoman Nell Soto said last week that she is proposing the change at the 
request of 12th Street constituents concerned about gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
Pomona Police Detective Dexter Cole said two 16-year-old boys who were not gang 
members were murdered in separate drive-by shootings this year on 12th Street. 
In January, Cole said, a gunman mistakenly presumed that the first victim 
belonged to the gang because he was walking on 12th Street. In April, the 
second boy was hit on the street by a stray bullet intended for a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, another 16-year-old boy who belonged to the 12th Street gang was 
killed in July when he was spotted on 12th Street, then chased and shot on a 
side street. 
</P>
<P>
Cole said the 12th Street gang, whose members range from youngsters to 
grandfathers, is one of the city's oldest, along with its historic rival, 
Cherryville. 
</P>
<P>
The current proposal to rename 12th Street is not the first time Pomona has 
played the name game with gangs. In the 1970s, the city tried to encourage 
members of the two gangs to become involved in constructive activities by 
naming parks for them. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Bridges, city parks and recreation director, said the effort produced 
good results at first at both Cherryville Park and Sharkie Park, named for the 
12th Street gang's symbol, a shark. But after a while, he said, both parks 
deteriorated into heavily vandalized gang hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, the city changed Cherryville to Hamilton Park and Sharkie to Madison. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Cole said renaming the street will "help in a small way." At least, 
he said, it will relieve 12th Street residents of the burden of living on a 
street identified with a gang. Although some gang members live on 12th Street, 
most live elsewhere, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Donna Smith said the name change's value is "psychological -- a clear 
message to the community that the council is serious about gangs." 
</P>
<P>
But skeptics, including Police Chief Lloyd Wood, doubt that changing the name 
of a street will reduce gang violence. So far this year, at least 20 of the 
city's 35 murders have been identified by police as gang-related. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Banales, a former Pomona gang member who is working to draw youngsters 
out of gang life, said name changes are irrelevant. The 12th Street gang won't 
pay any attention if the City Council renames the street, he said. "These 
people don't care about legislation and laws."

VOTER REGISTRATION DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A door-to-door voter registration drive is slated for Northwest Pasadena in 
advance of the Board of Directors election March 5. 
</P>
<P>
The $40,000 drive is funded by the Hahn Co., which operates the Plaza Pasadena 
shopping center. The money is part of the recent settlement of a lawsuit 
against Hahn by Pasadena Citizens for Representative Government. The group sued 
five years ago after its members were denied permission to gather signatures in 
the mall for a voter initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The citizens group will conduct the voter registration drive along with the 
Pasadena Foothill Chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, the Foothill 
Democratic Club, the Pasadena Area Peace Coordinating Council and ACT.

A private architect will be hired to make the final decision on a proposed 
three-story, 1,750-square-foot addition to the Oaklawn District estate of Lee 
Prentiss, a former mayor of South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
The council agreed Wednesday that it lacked the expertise to judge whether 
Prentiss' building plans violate state guidelines on the alteration of 
historical buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In a 5-0 vote, the council ordered that an architect with historical expertise 
be hired at Prentiss' expense to oversee the design plans and give any final 
approval. The council set a 30-day limit on the process.

SCHOOL DISTRICT'S 'CHOICE FOR GREED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our future depends upon the education and nurturing of our children. The 
Alhambra Board of Education chooses to put administrators' and teachers' 
economic interests before the creative, developmental and educational needs of 
our youth. 
</P>
<P>
In so doing, they are making a choice for greed rather than for nurturing and 
uplifting our society. 
</P>
<P>
Nov. 20, approximately 500 parents, teachers, and community members, along with 
a hired consultant, presented the board with proposals and appeals (Times, Nov. 
22). Parker Williams, the board president, stated that the board would work 
together to find a mutual solution with a task force composed of parents, 
teachers, administrators, and board members. The board has since denied that 
they agreed to do this. They say that they need to discuss the matter. During 
the Dec. 4 board meeting, the board stated that they have not made a decision 
in this regard. Why do you suppose that this is the case? Could it be that they 
are afraid to talk to concerned individuals, or are they embarrassed because 
they have no intention of even considering seeking an alternative solution? It 
would appear that the board is unresponsive to the community voice and to the 
needs of our children.

<P>
We applaud the efforts of Dora Padilla, board member, who has proposed that 
music and art be electives in the seventh- and eighth-grade curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
We implore teachers to defer pay raises until this budget crunch has passed. 
When funds are available, teachers will receive their raises, but the music and 
art programs will be gone, not only in the elementary level, but high school as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
Let's give kids a chance; greed has seen its day.
