YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC APPARENTLY VOTES TO SECEDE

LJUBLJANA, Yugoslavia 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Slovenes overwhelmingly voted Sunday in favor of their republic's secession 
from Yugoslavia, according to unofficial results. 
</P>
<P>
They voted despite federal threats of armed intervention. 
</P>
<P>
The turnout was reported to be 85% of 1.5 million eligible voters. 
</P>
<P>
Initial unofficial results of the plebiscite said that, with 55% of the ballots 
counted, 94% of the vote was for Slovenia to secede from Yugoslavia and 5% was 
against. One percent of the ballots were invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands danced and cheered and some uncorked champagne on the streets of the 
Slovenian capital of Ljubljana upon hearing the early results. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a historic night. We have waited for it for 1,000 years," Slovenian 
Prime Minister Lojze Peterle said. 
</P>
<P>
Demands for Slovenian independence have been growing since last April, when the 
republic voted to end Communist rule, in force for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Yugoslav republics have also ousted the Communists, leaving only 
two republics under Communist rule and helping to push Yugoslavia toward a 
political crisis that diplomats say could end in its disintegration. 
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav authorities in Belgrade said Slovenia's plebiscite was tantamount to 
unilateral secession, and they threatened reprisals against the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Although Slovenian leaders have described secession as a final option, the huge 
vote for independence could encourage them to push for a complete break with 
Yugoslavia.

<P>
Political philosopher Michael Oakeshott, whose stress on personal 
responsibility and freedom was said by some to have laid the foundations for 
Margaret Thatcher's social policies, has died at 89. 
</P>
<P>
Oakeshott died Tuesday at his home at Acton in southwest England, his family 
announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
No cause of death was given. 
</P>
<P>
In 1951, when he became University Professor of Political Science at London 
University's London School of Economics, his conservative ideas were a sharp 
contrast with socialist Harold Laski, whom he replaced. 
</P>
<P>
Oakeshott was credited with turning conservative opinion away from social 
planning and back to personal responsibility and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
The Times of London noted Saturday: "More than anybody else Michael Oakeshott 
articulated the real philosophical foundations of Mrs. Thatcher's policies. Yet 
he had no direct influence on her and she was disposed to consider him 
irrelevant for her purposes because unlike Hayek, he made no practical 
recommendations." 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Thatcher claimed that her philosophy of individual self-reliance was 
influenced by the Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek and his 1944 book "The 
Road to Serfdom," a critical study of socialistic trends in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
Oakeshott once said in an interview: "I am a member of no political party. I 
vote, if I have to vote, for the party which is likely to do the least harm. To 
that extent, I am a Tory." 
</P>
<P>
Oakeshott's books included "Experience and Its Modes," published in 1933, and 
"The Voice of Liberal Learning," which came out last year.

H. SANSBERRY; ACTRESS IN TV, MOVIES, STAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hope Sansberry, a character actress, whose career dated to the early days of 
film and stage but who will probably best be remembered for her portrayal of 
the colonel's wife on the long-running TV series "The Phil Silvers Show," has 
died in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Rose Mary Hinrichsen, a longtime friend, reported Sunday that Miss Sansberry 
was 94 when she died Dec. 14 in Leisure World. 
</P>
<P>
Generally assuming the parts of stately or professional women, Miss Sansberry 
-- who also acted under the name Virginia Staunton -- was seen in either 
Broadway or national touring companies of such stage classics as "I Remember 
Mama," "Bittersweet" and "Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Her pictures included "The Thrill of It All," "Son of Flubber," "The Great 
Waltz" and "A Crooked Ship." 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1955, she began her most enduring role, that of Nell Hall, wife 
of Col. John Hall (portrayed by Paul Ford) on Phil Silvers' outrageous satire 
of military life. The program ran on CBS through September, 1959, and is still 
seen in syndication.

NO PANACEA BUT MAY SAVE LIVES; 
</P>
<P>
FREEWAY FENCE COULD KEEP IMMIGRANTS FROM DANGER, BUT PROBLEMS REMAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Trying to imagine how successful a fence will be in discouraging immigrants 
from running across a freeway is itself a dash into the dark. What's clear is 
that more must be done to stop the slaughter on Interstate 5 in the vicinity of 
the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint in the Camp Pendleton area. Since 1987, 38 
people, mostly undocumented immigrants from Mexico and Central America, have 
been killed, and many more injured, trying to traverse the freeway to avoid the 
checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans last week announced that the $3-million fence would extend along an 
8-mile stretch of the interstate. The fence may not be a satisfactory permanent 
solution, but it could be a short-term one. That can buy time for a 
comprehensive look at problems associated with the checkpoint, even as a costly 
redesign and relocation of the facility get under way. 
</P>
<P>
Caltrans talks about the fence as if it will be around awhile, but the design 
doeslend itself to experimentation. The top will be similar to chain-link 
fencing, and can be recycled to some other purpose if the barrier doesn't work. 
The bottom three feet -- metal rails attached to wooden posts -- will function 
as a center divider to prevent cars from crossing into oncoming traffic, which 
the agency says is needed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
Critics understandably worry that immigrants simply will be trapped on the 
median strip when unable to clear the fence, and thus be subjected to the same 
or increased danger. Caltrans acknowledges it doesn't yet have answers for how 
the California Highway Patrol might get to those trapped along the fence, or 
for how emergency vehicles now responding out of San Clemente will get across 
the interstate. It says there probably will be places for such vehicles to 
traverse, but can't say how it will prevent these openings from themselves 
becoming immigrant crossing places. 
</P>
<P>
Also, everyone agrees that resourceful immigrants will take different routes. 
Caltrans is prepared to declare victory if that happens, on the theory that 
nothing can be worse than the current freeway crossings. Caltrans is probably 
right on the bottom line: If the fence saves lives and dissuades those who are 
not able-bodied from even trying to cross, it will be worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, the overall merits of the checkpoint concept, as well as attendant 
safety issues related to crossings and high-speed chases, should be 
reevaluated.

CALIFORNIA'S WATER PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While water prices may not accurately reflect the true value of this resourceto 
certain agricultural centers in the state, this is not so in urbanized Southern 
California. Metropolitan Water District has made major changes in water-pricing 
policies in the lastdecade. 
</P>
<P>
Incentive programs introduced in the 1980s to better manage existing supplies 
through waterconservation, reuse, water banking and seasonal pricing are all 
part of the reason why after four consecutive dry years this region is still 
relatively unharmed by the drought. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, because the drought has now moved into a fifth year, MWD has 
imposed a phased mandatory conservation program on its 27-member public 
agencies. A crucial element of this program is a 200% surcharge for water 
ordered beyond that allocated. Conversely, those agencies that successfully 
reduce water use beyond the target amount will be rewarded with a 50% rebate.

JUSTICE DENIED: A SYSTEM UNDER INCREASING STRESS; 
</P>
<P>
TIMES SERIES REVEALS THE PROBLEMS -- AND LIMITS -- OF LAW ENFORCEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most people in Los Angeles either knew, or could guess, that their lives and 
property were shielded behind a thin blue line. 
</P>
<P>
Even the ones lucky enough to exist at a comfortable remove from murder or 
burglary could sense that more and more, living in and around Los Angeles means 
living dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
But a prodigious amount of digging and analysis by Times writer David Freed now 
shows just how thin that line is, and how thin the system is that backs up 
uniformed officers in the work of separating the good guys from the bad guys. 
More chilling is the inescapable conclusion of the seven-part series: that the 
system can only postpone disorder, not prevent it. Ultimately, Los Angeles can 
stop living dangerously only if, as a society, it takes the wise advice of Los 
Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block. 
</P>
<P>
Block, increasingly something of a sage with gold- braid rank, says law 
enforcement does a good job of locking people up, but society needs better than 
that. The real answer, Block thinks, must come from what he sees as a massive 
Head Start program that will teach youngsters, rich and poor, "social skills" 
as part of the process of "establishing a value system." 
</P>
<P>
Block correctly points out that institutions other than the police must do the 
work needed "to break this cycle." And it will be expensive. But it may well be 
less expensive than a police force big enough to keep all the bad actors under 
control and smart enough to know who they are. That would be a kind of 
occupation force that democracy probably could not survive. Reform also would 
require more citizens to pay far closer attention to what used to be called 
civic duty. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles ranks behind only New York City and Miami in violent crime. Driven 
largely by drugs -- which account for more cases than all other felonies put 
together -- serious crimes have gone up by half in the last decade. But the 
ranks of the criminal justice system, from judges to uniformed patrols to 
prosecutors and police lab technicians, have grown nowhere near that fast. Los 
Angeles couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
In only five years, the number of gang members has doubled to 90,000. Of 182 
defendants in narcotics cases that turned up in a random computerized Times 
search, only 3% got the highest sentence prescribed by law. 
</P>
<P>
In another random batch of cases, 98% were settled without trial because the 
defendant pleaded guilty, often to a reduced charge. That is 6% higher than the 
national average of cases settled by plea bargaining, or "case management," as 
it is called by prosecutors fighting a riptide of fresh arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Plea bargaining helps hold the system together, but it is often attacked as a 
road to lenient sentences. One severe critic is Donald Burkes of Bakersfield, 
whose son, Rick, died in a one-car accident. The driver, charged with vehicular 
manslaughter, drunk driving and hit-and-run, escaped with a two-year prison 
sentence in exchange for pleading guilty. "Two years for a life," Burkes says. 
"All they care about is the numbers, processing the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
Under siege, the working parts of the system -- courts, prosecutors, police, 
probation officers, jailers and others -- seem to cling together for dear life 
in a complex web in which no one is really at fault. The frustration mounts. 
</P>
<P>
The strain on the system begins to show when Freed asks such questions as why 
only 17% of all felons are caught and less than 1% of all felony crimes result 
in the felon serving a maximum prison sentence. Then police say the judges are 
too soft. Prosecutors point to police failures to produce hard enough evidence 
to get convictions. Prosecutors are criticized for plea bargains that let too 
many suspects spend too little time in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Criminologist Charles E. Silberman wrote in 1978 that expecting police alone to 
stop criminal violence is "quixotic." So may be Sheriff Block's notion of 
getting back to the basics of civil society. But Los Angeles must make the 
effort.

The Metropolitan Water District water rationing plan will take effect in 
February (Part A, Dec. 12). I hope that, before imposing local rationing and 
penalties for overuse, Mayor Bradley, the City Council and the county Board of 
Supervisors will remember to rescind (or cancel if still pending) the permits 
for Playa Vista, Porter Ranch, the Farmer's Market development, the Marina 
Triangle, the UCLA expansion and all the hundreds of other huge extravagant 
projects now on the books and approved or pending. 
</P>
<P>
All of them would use millions of gallons of water, require hundreds of 
thousands of new sewer hookups to an already overburdened system and produce 
insane additions to traffic congestion. Even now we have no extra water, no 
more room on streets and freeways, and certainly not enough clean air to go 
around.

Unfortunately, Rostenkowski has it all wrong. These members of Congress voted 
for business-as-usual. They did not make tough decisions to solve the budget 
problems; they merely voted to push off the problems for another time by voting 
for a patch work budget.

A GENIUS FOR POLITICS, BUT WHAT ELSE?; 
</P>
<P>
MARIO CUOMO: HE HAS AN EXQUISITE SENSE OF TIMING AND WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
UNLESS HE'S SURE TO WIN. THAT DOESN'T MEAN HE CAN GOVERN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MURRAY KEMPTON, Murray Kempton writes a syndicated column in New York. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Will Mario Cuomo run for President in 1992? The answer is simple and will 
persuade anyone who overlooks its slight defect of not being an answer at all. 
</P>
<P>
Mario Cuomo will run for President if he senses he will win. He won't if he 
senses he will lose. He will have judged correctly in either case. Those 
assessments of the political future that are un-useful speculations for the 
rest of us are dead certainties for him. He always knows. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo's peculiar gift is a genius for politics, which is not, to be sure, the 
same thing as a genius for governing. When his wind is up as an orator, he can 
more than occasionally bemuse his auditors, not to say himself, into thinking 
him a lonely antagonist of destiny. But what he really is, instead, is 
destiny's favored messenger. 
</P>
<P>
On Labor Day, 1989, New York's Democratic mayoral primary was approaching its 
climax with most observers unconvinced that Edward Koch's official franchise 
for giving offense might not extend to another four years. Then Cuomo greeted 
the Labor Day marchers with the wickedly wistful expression of the hope that 
New York would find leaders of the sort who heal rather than wound. He cited 
David Dinkins and two other officeholders. He did not mention the incumbent 
mayor; it could be felt with resistless conviction that all was up for Koch. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the governor roused the New York Daily News strikers with 
incandescences of solidarity. He closed the question while men of good will and 
bad alike were still struggling to keep it open. No sensible politician could 
conceivably thus flame for the oppressed if he could remotely imagine that the 
oppressor might have a chance to pay him back. 
</P>
<P>
I have one or two friends who have crossed the News picket line and many more 
who have refused to; and the abandonment of all hope of a happy ending for any 
of them is a bitter thought. But Cuomo can be trusted never to throw caution to 
the winds if he feels the faintest breath of a breeze in the air. There is no 
appealing his cool and sober judgment; he had but to strike the opening chord 
of destiny's overture to persuade the ear that the curtain will fall upon the 
death of the Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
There are complaints that Cuomo's views on the Persian Gulf crisis are 
inscrutable. They are likely to stay that way so long as the event itself 
remains so inscrutable that even destiny cannot think of the lines to prompt 
him. Our official policy seems to have arrived at a condition of incoherence 
that suggests management of the sort that puzzles itself as much as it does its 
antagonist. 
</P>
<P>
Uncertainties of this sort do not fit Cuomo's style, which depends upon 
exquisite subtleties of timing inapplicable to messy and unresolved situations. 
Economy of effort marks the genius for politics; its highest art is waiting 
until the candidate for disposal wanders to the edge of the abyss and then 
giving the unobtrusively slight shove that carries him all the way down to the 
coroner's verdict of suicide. 
</P>
<P>
That was the fashion of Cuomo's dealings with Koch and it apparently obtains 
for his dealings with the Daily News. It was also the fashion of Joe McCarthy's 
riddance by Dwight Eisenhower, who may have been our last President to combine 
an acute genius for politics with a considerable talent for governing when he 
had to -- and who at the same time contrived to keep both secret from observers 
thought wiser than he. 
</P>
<P>
A genius for politics never permits itself a calculated stroke without its 
proper disguise as the spontaneous expression of a heart that can be silent no 
longer. If Cuomo runs for President, he will win. If he doesn't, he would have 
lost. How do I know? I don't have to; Cuomo will. A genius for politics is that 
rarest of presences, the one that frees us from guessing for ourselves because 
it somehow knows for sure.

PRAISE FOR SHEVARDNADZE IS MOSTLY FROM THE WEST BECAUSE HE WAS ITS PATSY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The undistinguished career of Eduard A. Shevardnadze as Soviet foreign minister 
glowed in the farewell tributes of his Western fans as if he had been 
Talleyrand. From Secretary of State James A. Baker III, from the German foreign 
minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, from the Western world, came testaments to 
the deep personal friendship borne for the white-haired Georgian, mingled with 
strophes about his vision and reforming zeal. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever Shevardnadze's achievements earlier in his career -- battling 
organized crime in his native Georgia -- and whatever opportunities the future 
might still hold (for by no means should he be counted entirely out of the 
game), his term as foreign minister was a classic example of how to play a weak 
hand badly. 
</P>
<P>
Entirely ignorant of international affairs when he was first drafted by Mikhail 
Gorbachev, he never seemed to pick up much beyond the propensity -- delightful 
from NATO's point of view -- to surrender with scarcely a pretense of struggle 
to the propositions of his opposite numbers at the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
He was hailed as "Mr. Yes" to distinguish him from "Mr. No," Andrei A. Gromyko, 
who was the senior Soviet professional in the conduct of foreign affairs for 
four decades. But Gromyko was a knowledgeable person imbued with a certain 
world view -- he would have called it "revolutionary" -- that emerged in often 
surprisingly humane and comical ways in his memoirs, as when he recalled how 
sad he and his colleagues were at the death of Elvis Presley, whom he 
considered a gifted talent distorted by capitalism and a rapacious manager. 
</P>
<P>
It's unlikely that Shevardnadze's autobiography, should he come to write one, 
will contain such pleasing moments. The most striking image he leaves behind as 
foreign minister is of him smirking from behind Baker like a compliant equerry. 
</P>
<P>
It would be unfair to tax Shevardnadze with decisions doubtless made by 
Gorbachev, or the Gorbachev faction overall, but it was not necessarily a favor 
to his country or to a more supple foreign policy for him to come across as a 
yes-man for a NATO take on what the structure of the post-Cold-War world should 
be. 
</P>
<P>
In the Western press, everything happening in the Soviet Union is reconstructed 
in cartoon terms as a battle between "radicals" and "conservatives," but it is 
worth getting a taste of the debate in the Congress of Peoples' Deputies in the 
hours after Shevardnadze had thunderstruck the audience by his sudden and 
somewhat hysterically phrased resignation. 
</P>
<P>
"You, Shevardnadze," shouted the Byelorussian writer Alexander Adamovitch, 
"together with (Alexander) Yakovlev and Gorbachev, you started perestroika. You 
had no idea that these hordes of bastards would throw themselves at you?" 
</P>
<P>
Hardly had Adamovitch sat down before Col. Viktor I. Alksnis, a particular 
target of Shevardnadze's wrath, was on his feet: "In front of you there is a 
reactionary; in front of you there is a bastard. I understand the accusation. 
Yes, I am a reactionary when I'm concerned about the baby thrown out of a 
burning building . . . Yes, I am for the resignation of Eduard Shevardnadze. I 
am not against foreign policy. No. We should leave Eastern Europe. But I'm 
against the way it is conducted." 
</P>
<P>
Alksnis went on to criticize Shevardnadze's handling of the gulf crisis, which 
did indeed leave much to be desired. Baker was able to stampede, cajole and 
bribe the U.N. Security Council into a resolution universally construed as 
sanctioning the use of force only because Shevardnadze signaled his support at 
the critical moment. A responsible position, though one that would have 
involved him in the apparently abhorrent exercise of saying "no" to a U.S. 
secretary of state, would have been for Shevardnadze to insist that economic 
sanctions were not being given adequate time to take effect. 
</P>
<P>
The trouble with Shevardnadze's public style in the execution of foreign policy 
was that it devalued the idiom of detente. If every negotiation begins with 
only token resistance and ends in abject surrender, then very soon the 
negotiating partner or adversary will take such a posture for granted and be 
outraged at the slightest display of resistance or backbone. 
</P>
<P>
So the minute Shevardnadze's successor displays somewhat greater reserve to an 
American initiative there will be cries in Washington (by no means necessarily 
of distress) that the nyet is back and the Cold War once more raging. 
Shevardnadze should have reflected more on the advice of Talleyrand to his 
subordinates: Pas de zele -- Don't be too enthusiastic. Romping around the 
post-Cold-War world with Baker, Shevardnadze just looked and behaved like a 
pushover, the last thing a foreign minister should ever resemble.

RAMS' STRING SHORTENS TO ONE GAME; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: PLAYING UNINSPIRED TOWARD SEASON'S END, THEY FALL, 20-13, TO THE 
FALCONS.

ATLANTA 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Looking every bit a demoralized football team struggling to push emotional 
buttons that no longer are in working order, the Rams took one more sluggish 
step toward their only lasting, attainable goal this season: finishing it. 
</P>
<P>
Only one more game to go, and the Rams can be free of their week-to-week 
plunge, Sunday's version being a 20-13 loss to the Atlanta Falcons, owners of a 
seven-game losing streak until this week. 
</P>
<P>
Before an occasionally attentive Fulton County Stadium crowd of 30,021, the 
Rams (5-10) assured themselves of finishing with their worst record in Coach 
John Robinson's eight-year tenure and cannot have strengthened team 
management's desire to keep him around. 
</P>
<P>
"Seems like it's all going downhill," cornerback Jerry Gray said. "It's just 
not getting any better." 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Rams were mathematically eliminated from the playoff race by the 
San Francisco 49ers. This week, they didn't roll over and play dead against the 
4-11 Falcons, but they didn't exactly bristle with sustained fury, either. 
</P>
<P>
Behind 10-0 almost before you could say "wait 'til next season," the Rams 
stayed in the contest until it was time to go home. Then they obediently packed 
their bags and did just that. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams in 1990: The sag continues. 
</P>
<P>
"The emotion wasn't there," defensive end Doug Reed said. "We didn't play the 
game with any intensity or consistency. Seemed like we just went out hoping. We 
got to a point where we just didn't work hard, like they wanted it more than we 
did from the beginning to the end." 
</P>
<P>
For all their coach's talk of personal pride and duty to the idea of team, are 
the Rams just coasting out the season now, waiting for the inevitable changes 
to come? 
</P>
<P>
"That's there," Reed said. "Everybody's looking for the season to end, just get 
it over with. But we have one more game left (at New Orleans), and I think 
you've got to look at this game and go into it with a little bit more than we 
showed today. Or I think it turns to embarrassment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I'm embarrassed. I'm embarrassed to go out there and not even seem like 
we wanted the game." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson seemed to be less upset with the Rams' level of intensity Sunday. 
Perhaps numb by now, Robinson said he didn't notice his team playing 
particularly uninspired. 
</P>
<P>
"We got off to a slow start," Robinson said. "They kind of stunned us. After 
that, I felt it was an even game, and we just didn't do the things you have to 
do to win." 
</P>
<P>
Three times, the Rams drove inside the Atlanta 10-yard line, and only once were 
they able to push it in for a touchdown. On the last time, Robinson eschewed a 
potential game-tying touchdown try on fourth and goal from the one, but Mike 
Lansford's short field goal was blocked. 
</P>
<P>
"Their will was just stronger than ours down there today," Ram quarterback Jim 
Everett said of the Falcon goal-line stands. 
</P>
<P>
Atlanta's will to rush Everett was pretty strong Sunday, too. The Falcons 
knocked him around almost every time he threw the ball and pressured him into 
his worst day of a not-exactly-banner season. Everett completed only 13 of 40 
passes for 171 yards, was intercepted twice -- once for a touchdown -- and was 
clearly shaken more by the Falcon rush than their two sacks would seem to 
indicate. 
</P>
<P>
Everett has two interceptions in each of his past three games and has 17 for 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Everett and the Ram offense scored 44 easy points on the 
overmatched and confused Falcon defense. Before Sunday, Atlanta had given up a 
league-worst 261 net passing yards a game. Sunday, the Falcons held the Rams to 
155. 
</P>
<P>
This time, the Falcons overwhelmed the Ram pass protection, ruining those 
pretty timing routes while avoiding the big bombs a blitzing defense can 
surrender to the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
"They did a good job of trying to knock me out of there," Everett said. "They 
brought more people than they have in the past, and they were successful doing 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Robinson: "The key to the game was the offense's inability to score when 
we got down there. We were in goal-line territory twice and came away with 
three points. We just weren't able to come back from those things. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been frustrating for us for a period of time now that our offense just 
doesn't seem to have the necessary ability to get the ball into the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
On offense the Falcons were down to their third-string quarterback, former Ram 
backup Hugh Millen, who followed the lead of Anthony Dilweg, Bubby Brister and 
Jim Harbaugh and other sub-superstar quarterbacks who have been driving the Ram 
defense crazy all season. Millen, in only his second NFL start, completed 13 of 
21 passes for 178 yards and looked quite capable of throwing for more. 
</P>
<P>
The reason he didn't was that the Falcons decided to sit on the ball for almost 
the entire fourth quarter, which allowed tailback Mike Rozier to have the third 
consecutive 100-yard rushing performance against the Rams, but also gave the 
Rams a couple of extra shots to try and drag the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
The eventual game-deciding series came early in the fourth quarter with the 
Falcons leading, 20-13. The Rams were given excellent field position on a short 
punt and zipped straight up to the Atlanta four-yard line. They were denied a 
touchdown when officials picked up a flag for pass interference on third down, 
ruling that the pass to Cleveland Gary was uncatchable. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams decided not to try to punch it in from the one on fourth down, but 
Lansford's field goal attempt was blocked by Falcon defensive lineman Mike 
Gann. 
</P>
<P>
Why go for the field goal there? 
</P>
<P>
"(I) thought there was plenty of time (about 12 minutes)," Robinson said. "We 
weren't doing anything. We didn't have anything that we just felt was going to 
get us in the thing." 
</P>
<P>
Then, on their last real shot at tying the score, the Rams got as far as the 
Falcon 38 before Atlanta cornerback Deion Sanders tipped away an Everett pass 
to Henry Ellard on fourth and four. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave away 10 points at the start of the game, and we could never get them 
back," Robinson said. "The game pretty much settled into, I guess, a pretty 
even battle from then on, but we just were never able to overcome it." 
</P>
<P>
A mere three plays into the game, Everett wobbled one over the middle in the 
general direction of Ellard but specifically into the hands of Falcon safety 
Scott Case. Case ran 36 yards for a touchdown, finishing with a flying leap 
over Everett's last-gasp tackle try at the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
And after a failed Ram series, Millen hit receiver George Jones, who flew past 
the Ram secondary for a 53-yard gain. Four plays later, the Falcons were up, 
10-0, on Greg Davis' short field goal, and the Rams were in a hole they could 
not escape. 
</P>
<P>
They came as close as 10-7 on Gary's 15th touchdown of the season, a tough 
seven-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
"They covered us well and they played hard," Robinson said of the Falcons. 
</P>
<P>
While the Rams are just playing out the string. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Kevin Greene suffered a shoulder sprain in the third quarter and did 
not return. . . . The rest of the Rams' injury report: Guard Tom Newberry 
(re-aggravated right ankle), tight end Pat Carter (right knee bruise), 
linebacker Mike Wilcher (dislocated finger). . . . To find a worse Ram record 
than this year (the best they can do is 6-10), you have to go back to 1982's 
2-7 strike-shortened season, which was Ray Malavasi's last. John Robinson took 
over the next season.

MAGIC TAKES HIS ANGER OUT, 118-94 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Lakers, who have been having trouble on the court, suddenly found 
themselves with trouble off of it Sunday night before solving both problems at 
the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
First, there was the blowout, courtesy of the Minnesota Timberwolves, a howling 
disaster on the road. The Timberwolves, losers of seven in a row on the road, 
once again unleashed 7-foot-3 center Randy Breuer on Magic Johnson and suffered 
the consequences of a 118-94 defeat. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson played only 27 minutes, but that was long enough for 13 assists, 15 
points, six rebounds and a mini-blowup with General Manager Jerry West. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson reacted strongly to statements by West reported in the Plain Dealer of 
Cleveland last week in which West critiqued Johnson's play. West was quoted as 
saying, "Magic has been playing OK. At times, he's looked like the Magic of 
last year." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson told reporters before the game that because of West's comments, he 
wasn't sure he wanted to play for the Lakers. But after a brief postgame 
meeting with West, Johnson seemed placated. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel a lot better now," Johnson said. "He just told me that I guess he was 
taken out of context. Basically, that was it. 
</P>
<P>
"What I'm saying, just come to me," Johnson said what he wished West had done 
with his printed comments. "I've been here 12 years. I think I deserve that. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked at first, then I was upset," he said. "Now, it's over. I want to 
be here. We gave each other a high five, laughed, and now let's go back to 
work." 
</P>
<P>
The job Sunday night was to extend the Timberwolves' losing streak to six, 
which they did. James Worthy had 24 points and A.C. Green 20 in only 29 
minutes, primarily inside. 
</P>
<P>
While the Laker running game reappeared in an unlikely matchup against the 
down-tempo Timberwolves, Coach Mike Dunleavy experienced the luxury of playing 
his non-starters for significant minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Worthy, who played 35 minutes, and Sam Perkins (31 minutes) were the only 
Lakers to play more than 29 minutes. Johnson pointed out that the Laker break 
was a rolling gang on five, not just two or three players, but claimed he had 
nothing to prove to West or anyone else during the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I got a job to do, regardless," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnson said he never considered West's comments trivial. 
</P>
<P>
"It's serious to me, shoot," Johnson said. "It's like your boss saying 
something behind your back and he hasn't told you and everybody else knows." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, West is busy trying to find some backcourt help. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty obvious our backcourt has not played as well as we would have 
liked," he said. "There are some pretty decent names floating around. 
</P>
<P>
"You always look to do something," West said. "The danger is I don't think 
anyone knows what this team is. At times, we play very encouraging. Other 
times, we come up with a stinker." 
</P>
<P>
This was one of the encouraging times. Johnson, who had eight assists in the 
first quarter, directed the Laker fast break to a 61-48 lead at the half. It 
might have been more if not for Gerald Glass. 
</P>
<P>
At different times, the Lakers tried Larry Drew, Terry Teagle, Byron Scott and 
James Worthy on Glass, a streak-shooting small forward who leaned into the 
defense for 15 points in only nine minutes of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Green scored back-to-back inside baskets to end the first quarter with a 
10-point Laker lead that was still nine points when Johnson and Scott returned 
after a relief stint by Drew and Teagle. 
</P>
<P>
Glass finished with 32 points in 24 minutes and 7-0 Felton Spencer had a 
career-high 19 rebounds. The Laker revival signs included Drew, who passed out 
12 assists in 21 minutes, and Vlade Divac, who had eight of the Lakers' 50 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
"Things are not going as well as we like, but things are looking up," Johnson 
said. "And now, they are looking really up." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Bel-Air isn't that far from Inglewood, but from Kareem Abdul-Jabbar's house, 
the Lakers look a long way off. "I've watched from a distance," said 
Abdul-Jabbar, who cautioned against expecting too much from the Lakers. 
"They're going through a period of adjustment and it's tough on them," he said. 
"They have to find different ways to win than they did when I was there. We ran 
more, we played more post-up game. We had that type of personnel. They are 
having a hard time finding how to win with the personnel they have. But I think 
they have a fine team and they just have to stick with it. They're definitely 
going to make the playoffs and they're definitely going to be contenders."

GIANTS CLINCH PLAYOFF BYE WITH 24-21 WIN; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: HOSTETLER MAKES FIRST START THIS SEASON IN PLACE OF SIMMS AND BEATS 
CARDINALS FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE TIME.

<P>
Jeff Hostetler has not played much in his seven seasons in the NFL, but the New 
York Giants' backup quarterback has made a career out of beating the Phoenix 
Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
In his first start this season on Sunday, Hostetler passed for 190 yards and 
scored the go-ahead touchdown on a four-yard run in the Giants' 24-21 victory 
over the Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave the NFC East champion Giants (12-3) a first-round bye in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We got what we wanted. I'll take 12 wins in this league any time," Giant Coach 
Bill Parcells said. "Hostetler did a good job. He played error-free and made 
good decisions on the field. 
</P>
<P>
"We got a good lead, but then we gave the Cardinals some momentum and allowed 
them to come back on us. It looked like they were going to win it at one 
point." 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler, who completed 13 of 23 passes and rushed nine times for 31 yards, 
has beaten Phoenix three times in relief of Phil Simms -- including 20-13 last 
season at Phoenix and 20-19 on Oct. 21 at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Simms is sidelined with a severely sprained right foot, sustained in a loss to 
Buffalo on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
"I just told myself to relax and play my game," said Hostetler, who had only 14 
quarters of NFL experience before Sunday. "I was rusty a little bit, but I got 
more confidence as the game went on. 
</P>
<P>
"The guys responded well to me and I think they have confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
It was the Cardinals' fifth consecutive loss to the Giants and eliminated 
Phoenix (5-10) from wild-card playoff contention despite a career-high passing 
day by Timm Rosenbach. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenbach completed 23 of 41 passes for 381 yards and brought Phoenix within 
24-21 on his third touchdown pass, a three-yarder to rookie Ricky Proehl with 
2:09 left. 
</P>
<P>
Proehl recovered the ensuing onside kick at the Cardinal 43. Rosenbach drove 
his team to the New York 40 but they got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
A holding penalty and Lawrence Taylor's sack for an eight-yard loss brought the 
ball back to the Giants' 42, and New York took over after a fourth-down 
incompletion with 52 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
"The Giants are the class of the East," Cardinal Coach Joe Bugel said. "We 
wanted to battle them and see what would happen. 
</P>
<P>
"We laid it all on the field today and came up a little short with a couple of 
critical errors. We have to find a way to win games like this one of these 
days." 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler put New York ahead17-7 when he connected with Mark Ingram on a 
44-yard touchdown pass play with 7:31 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Cardinals closed to within 17-14 just 22 seconds later when Ernie Jones 
turned a swing pass from Rosenbach into a 68-yard touchdown play. 
</P>
<P>
It was the longest completion of Rosenbach's two-year NFL career and the 
longest play from scrimmage allowed by the Giants this season. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix appeared ready to take the lead, but reserve running back Terrence 
Flagler dropped a third-down pass at the New York five and Al Del Greco was 
wide left on a 30-yard field-goal attempt with 1:50 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Everson Walls returned his 50th career interception seven yards to the New York 
37 to set up Hostetler's four-yard scoring run on a broken play for a 24-14 
lead with 8:58 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Duerson's end zone interception with 4:34 left on a first-and-goal play 
from the New York nine-yard line ended another Cardinal threat. 
</P>
<P>
"Timm was trying to throw the ball away, but he didn't get it high enough," 
Bugel said. "I told him the next time, give the fans in the stands a souvenir. 
He's young and still learning." 
</P>
<P>
The Giants built a 10-0 lead on Matt Bahr's 27-yard field goal with 46 seconds 
remaining in the first quarter and Rodney Hampton's two-yard touchdown with 
3:15 left in the first half that capped a 78-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
Phoenix cut its halftime deficit to 10-7 on an 11-yard scoring pass from 
Rosenbach to Flagler with 45 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Bahr was short on a 48-yard field-goal attempt on the half's final play. Del 
Greco was short on a 47-yard try early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Johnson gained 50 yards in 15 carries for the Cardinals.

<P>
The New York Jets ended a five-game losing streak and, not surprisingly, it was 
the New England Patriots that helped them do it. 
</P>
<P>
Freeman McNeil rushed for two touchdowns and Ken O'Brien passed for two more 
Sunday as the Jets routed the Patriots, 42-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots (1-14), who have lost a team-record 13 consecutive games, clinched 
the top pick in next spring's draft. A loss next week against the NFC 
East-champion New York Giants would make this Patriot team the worst in 
franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to cry, I'm not going to give a speech," Patriot Coach Rod Rust 
said. "We just didn't get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of it was them. But, that aside, clearly everyone did not play well." 
</P>
<P>
Shedding their recently inept offensive ways, the Jets (5-10) put together 
three impressive drives in each half against the NFL's worst defense. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been going through growing pains," McNeil said, "and to have a game like 
this after such a long drought is a real boost. 
</P>
<P>
"We know how it feels to win again and we can carry that feeling. I look ahead 
and see great things happening here in the future." 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who completed 11 of 12 passes for 210 yards, connected with rookies 
Rob Moore and Blair Thomas on touchdown pass plays of two and six yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets also displayed a strong rushing attack among four players, with McNeil 
scoring on runs of one and nine yards. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas rushed for 88 yards, Brad Baxter gained 61, Johnny Hector had 45, and 
McNeil 36. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone could have run through the holes today," Baxter said. "It was our 
best-balanced attack all year." 
</P>
<P>
Hector capped an 80-yard drive with a seven-yard run to give the Jets a 7-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots tied the score on a 24-yard pass from Marc Wilson to Irving Fryar 
that capped a 64-yard drive. Starting quarterback Tommy Hodson sprained his 
left ankle on the fourth play of the drive and Wilson came on and connected 
with Michael Timpson for 14 yards on his first play. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets came back with a 73-yard drive that Moore finished with a two-yard 
touchdown reception. McNeil had the big play, gaining 39 yards with a screen 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
A 46-yard flea-flicker pass from O'Brien to Chris Burkett highlighted the Jets' 
next drive, which covered 76 yards and was capped by McNeil's nine-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
The onslaught continued in the third quarter as a 55-yard drive ended with 
McNeil's one-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
John Stephens gained 44 yards in 11 carries for the Patriots.

NBA ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
IT DOESN'T TAKE LONG FOR CELTICS TO FLOOR HAWKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
It was cruel and unjust punishment to make the Atlanta Hawks show up in Boston 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The way the Celtics are playing, it's almost impossible to beat them when you 
get an even start. But to spot them 15 points at home is an almost-impossible 
task. 
</P>
<P>
The Hawks had to make a special appearance to make up a game postponed Nov. 28 
because of a slippery, dangerous floor at Boston Garden. When play was stopped, 
the Celtics led, 37-22, after 13 1/2 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't get any better for the Hawks 25 days later. The Celtics built a 
28-point halftime lead and coasted to a 132-104 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Gamble led the Celtics with 25 points as they improved the second-best 
record in the NBA to 22-4 and increased their lead in the Atlantic Division to 
four games. They are 13-1 at home. 
</P>
<P>
"When we were here for the original game, we were in an eight-game losing 
streak," Atlanta Coach Bob Weiss said. "We played today like a team that was 
still in the slump, not like one that recently won six in a row." 
</P>
<P>
Celtic Coach Chris Ford said he worried that his team wouldn't be ready when 
play was resumed. He didn't need to worry. The Celtics, stretching their 
winning streak to seven games, made their first seven shots. 
</P>
<P>
By the start of the fourth quarter, the Celtics had a 103-68 lead and reserves 
were playing for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
The postponement was caused because ice under the basketball floor condensed 
and made the floor wet. With the temperature 68 in Boston, there was fear the 
bad conditions would repeat. 
</P>
<P>
"We were again worried about the floor," Dominique Wilkins said. "Obviously, 
they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 132, Denver 101 -- A running team has little chance to beat the 
powerful Trail Blazers -- especially a crippled one. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets, who have lost Orlando Woolridge for at least two months with an 
eye injury, lost Todd Lichti with a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
They stayed within 10 points for the first half at Portland, but it became a 
rout in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey had 23 points and 14 rebounds for the Trail Blazers, who improved 
the best record in the NBA to 24-3. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 99, Utah 93 -- Sherman Douglas had 23 points and 10 assists at Miami and 
the Heat, catching Karl Malone and John Stockton on off nights, ended a 10-game 
losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
Malone, although he had 17 rebounds, made only seven of 20 attempts from the 
field and Stockton was only one of nine. 
</P>
<P>
After the Jazz pulled to one point, 94-93, Stockton missed a short jumper. 
Douglas was fouled and converted both shots. Stockton then missed a three-point 
shot and the Heat had the first victory for one of the four expansion teams in 
the past 33 games. DAN HAFNER

COLLEGE BASKETBALL NATIONAL ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
MURDOCK (45) CAN'T BEAT ARIZONA BY HIMSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It took a balanced performance by fourth-ranked Arizona to offset the one-man 
show that Providence's Eric Murdock put on Sunday in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a McKale Center-record 45 points by Murdock, the Wildcats pulled out a 
99-87 victory to go to 8-1 for the season and extend their nation-leading home 
winning streak to 52 games. Providence is 7-2. 
</P>
<P>
Providence Coach Rick Barnes said the game made two things obvious. 
</P>
<P>
"One of them," he said, "is that Arizona's basketball team is certainly one of 
the best teams in the country. Another is that Eric Murdock proved why he's one 
of the best players in the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't trade him for any player in the country. He was the one guy who 
thought we could win this game." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson called Murdock "as good a guard as I've seen since 
I've been out here. What's significant about him is that he plays well at both 
ends of the court. He's constantly a threat on defense. Even when we thought we 
had good pressure on him, he still was able to knock them down." 
</P>
<P>
Murdock, a 6-foot-2 senior guard, scored 19 points in the final 9:45. He pulled 
the smaller Friars within 88-81 with 2:19 left on a jump shot for his 44th 
point. It came during a 10-0 Providence run that cut Arizona's lead to 88-85. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:06 left, he made one of two free throws to cut the deficit to 89-86. 
</P>
<P>
But with 36 seconds left and Providence trailing 93-87, Murdock dribbled the 
ball off his foot. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Mills finished with 28 points for Arizona, Matt Muehlebach had 18, Sean 
Rooks 14 and Brian Williams 12. 
</P>
<P>
Murdock broke the McKale Center record of 41 points set by Arizona's Al Fleming 
in 1976 against Detroit. Murdock had four three-pointers among his 14 baskets. 
</P>
<P>
The game was the third and last Providence would play without starting point 
guard Corey Floyd and reserves Marvin Saddler and Kenny McDonald, who were 
suspended by the NCAA for one game and the school for two more for their part 
in a brawl against Rhode Island on Dec. 8. 
</P>
<P>
No. 15 Connecticut 94, Fairfield 70 -- Scott Burrell scored a career-high 23 
points and grabbed nine rebounds as the Huskies found their outside shooting 
touch at Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (6-1) played without Coach Jim Calhoun, who was hospitalized with 
flu symptoms. Assistant Howie Dickenman ran the team. 
</P>
<P>
Connecticut put the game out of reach with a 13-3 run in the second half, 
capped by Chris Smith's three-pointer that made it 62-42. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have had trouble from three-point range (25.4%) and the foul line 
(52.5%) this season, but they improved in those areas against the Stags. 
Connecticut hit six of nine from three-point range and 22 of 34 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
REGIONAL HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
WEST 
</P>
<P>
Stevie Wise scored 29 points, including eight in a crucial 15-4 run in the 
second half, to lead Colorado (6-3) to an 89-79 nonconference victory over 
Stanford (6-2) at Boulder, Colo. Colorado hit six free throws in the final 1:18 
to seal the victory. Adam Keefe led Stanford with 20 points. . . . Maurice 
Alexander scored 21 points and Paris Bryant added 20 to lead Wyoming (7-1) to a 
98-84 victory over Sam Houston State (1-9) at Huntsville, Tex. . . . Mike 
Iuczolino scored 30 points to lead St. Francis, Pa., (5-4) to an 82-71 victory 
over Virginia Commonwealth (4-5) at the Chaminade Kauai Classic at Kapaa, 
Hawaii. In the other game, Stan Rose and Elbert Rogers scored 17 points apiece 
and Alabama-Birmingham (7-3) used a 28-0 first half run to beat Chaminade, 
87-60. Chaminade is 3-6. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
EAST 
</P>
<P>
Guard Mark Haughton scored a season-high 23 points and forward Mark Murray 
added 18 points to lead Delaware (2-6) to an 81-76 victory over visiting Maine 
(4-5).

FEMINISTS CALL FOR BOYCOTT OF BAR OVER BIKINI COLLAGE; 
</P>
<P>
PROTEST: MANAGEMENT DEFENDS THE DISPLAY, SAYING IT DRAWS CUSTOMERS AND NONE OF 
THE WOMEN IN THE PHOTOGRAPHS HAS COMPLAINED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
That staple of the California beach bar scene -- the wet bikini contest "wall 
of fame" -- has prompted a boycott by South Bay feminists against a popular 
Redondo Beach nightspot. 
</P>
<P>
Moose McGillycuddy's, a King Harbor bar and restaurant, became the target of a 
petition drive and letter-writing campaign this week after its general manager 
refused a female patron's request to remove a wall-sized collage made up of 
snapshots of contestants in the Wednesday night bikini contest it held last 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
"If Moose's cannot promote its business without objectifying and exploiting 
women in the process, then perhaps they do not deserve to have our business," 
said Nancy Jo Rettig, a 30-year-old Redondo Beach woman who frequently lunched 
at the bar until her request was ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Rettig, a volunteer counselor for battered women, not only gathered the 
signatures of more than 100 South Bay men and women who have promised not to 
patronize the bar, she also prompted a letter-writing campaign by the Palos 
Verdes-South Bay Chapter of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
At issue are the snapshots -- hundreds of them -- of oiled young women dancing 
in string bikinis and spike heels for the $100 prize bestowed weekly before a 
mostly male crowd. Most of the photographs are no more revealing than, say, a 
hot day in Hermosa Beach, but a number of them have been cropped to show 
contestants from the neck down. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Gebhart, general manager at Moose McGillycuddy's, said the collage is a 
successful promotion for the bar's current midweek lingerie contests, which 
bring in the beach crowd on nights that otherwise would be slow. Other 
beach-area bar owners buttress his claim, noting that similar collages adorn 
the walls of many successful South Bay watering holes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not taking this real seriously," Gebhart said, noting that none of the 
women in the photographs have complained to him and business hasn't suffered. 
</P>
<P>
But in interviews, at least one bikini contest veteran said she has had mixed 
feelings about snapshots of her that have ended up on barroom walls. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're really wrong," said Lisa Anne Schleuniger of El Segundo, 
a 27-year-old sales representative who has competed for six years in bikini and 
wet T-shirt contests, and whose snapshots have been displayed in bars 
throughout the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
"But a lot of times, all they do is zoom in on your body parts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Schleuniger said she has often felt uncomfortable about the way she has been 
photographed during such contests. Once, in fact, she demanded that an Orange 
County bar remove a snapshot of her from its wall because she had been bending 
over when the photo was taken and its focal point was her derriere. 
</P>
<P>
She said that she has won thousands of dollars in the contests over the years. 
</P>
<P>
Still, she said, "I think that if someone is going to take a picture of you, 
you know, they ought to include your head." 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Blair Porter, coordinator for the Palos Verdes-South Bay chapter of 
NOW, called the controversy "a real issue of education." 
</P>
<P>
"The attitude is that boys will be boys, but boys don't have to be boys like 
this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"The photos don't portray women as people with hearts and minds. They reduce 
them to big breasts and bare bottoms. If they're going to take photographs, 
they should do justice to these women, and picture them as whole human beings, 
not just body parts." 
</P>
<P>
Porter, who launched a letter-writing campaign against the bar in the most 
recent NOW newsletter, said that collages, such as the one at Moose 
McGillycuddy's, demean and degrade women and encourage male customers to treat 
them as something other than equal human beings. 
</P>
<P>
Rettig added that, although she objects to such collages at all bars, she 
targeted Moose McGillycuddy's because "it advertises itself as a family place, 
and that poster is on the first floor, right outside the bathrooms at a child's 
level." 
</P>
<P>
Bill Bastian, owner of the End Zone in Hermosa Beach, which also has a wall 
full of bikini-contest candids, defended the collages. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they're degrading. In fact, I think the opposite: I admire 
(women's) beauty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
And photographs of only parts of the women have never engendered complaints in 
his bar, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, he said, one of his most popular collages featured in its lower 
right-hand corner a snapshot of a contestant's backside. 
</P>
<P>
"I captioned it -- and you've got to visualize this, now -- I captioned it, 
'The End,' " he said. "I never got any feedback on that. In fact, I kind of 
thought it was cute." 
</P>
<P>
Bastian added, however, that Gebhart may be taking the controversy too lightly. 
</P>
<P>
"I kind of think it's silly," Bastian said, "but who knows? A petition against 
meat loaf can be damaging if it gets a groundswell of support."

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: FOR A TRENDY, LAST-MINUTE PRESENT, TRY A LIVING HAM 
</P>

<P>
Stuck for a last-minute Christmas gift for the spouse or kids? 
</P>
<P>
Want to be a trend-setter? Maybe a Chinese potbelly pig is just the thing. 
</P>
<P>
Since arriving from China and Vietnam about six years ago, the pint-size 
porkers have become popular in both Northern California and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
A bit part in the movie "Air America" helped; so does a co-starring role in one 
of Cal Worthington's car commercials. 
</P>
<P>
If Pete Hupp, a former Encinitas resident now living in Butte County, has his 
way, San Diego County will be the next hot spot. To test the market, he shipped 
two of the mini-swine to a friend in Encinitas, who is advertising for buyers. 
</P>
<P>
For $1,000 you can get either Lotus or Pearl, stout and covered with bristly 
black hair. Maximum adult size: 20 inches tall, 80 pounds, belly almost 
dragging the ground. 
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, ads buying and selling potbellies fill a column in the Sunday 
newspaper. In Los Angeles, a Southern California Potbellied Pig Assn. has 
formed to ensure that they're treated as pets rather than livestock on such 
matters as zoning. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the San Diego market is ripe for potbelly pigs," said Hupp, 38, a 
nurse. "They're clean, affectionate and smart." 
</P>
<P>
And a good investment maybe. In Sacramento, a brood sow with good bloodlines 
goes for $3,000 or more. 
</P>
<P>
Hupp sees the potbelly as the ideal modern pet, even for condo-dwellers: 
quieter than a dog (a soft grunt), more solicitous than a cat, more intelligent 
than goldfish. 
</P>
<P>
True, the potbellies do share a characteristic with their behemoth brethren. On 
warm days, they like to roll around in water or mud. 
</P>
<P>
"You can easily take care of that need with a small wading pool in your back 
yard or porch," Hupp said. 
</P>
<P>
He figures that's a small price to pay for love and loyalty.

Movie madness.

* There's always a local angle, even in "Godfather III," which opens on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
La Jolla psychotherapist Linnda Durre has a bit part in a scene where Al Pacino 
summons other Mafia dons to Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
Durre plays a floozy cocktail waitress, dressed in gold lame top and stockings, 
tangerine miniskirt and sequined bow tie and hat. Filmed in Cinecitta studio in 
Rome. 
</P>
<P>
Durre, who had gone to Italy for vacation, got the part through a friend. She 
has studied acting, written a television pilot and attends a comedy workshop in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
In between, she does family and marriage counseling. 
</P>
<P>
* Depending on your taste, this is either good or bad news.

For many years, one of the busiest X-rated movie theaters in San Diego was the 
Capri on Park Boulevard in Hillcrest. 
</P>
<P>
Then Great American Savings Bank, which had a branch next door, got annoyed 
with its steamy neighbor. It bought the property and booted the operator. 
</P>
<P>
The theater reopened as the Park, showing foreign and artsy fare. 
</P>
<P>
Now San Diego-based Great American has been bought by Wells Fargo. Rumors 
spread that Wells, based in libertine San Francisco, might allow the return of 
more profitable skin flicks. 
</P>
<P>
But a Wells spokesman says no: The theater will remain high-brow. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Betty-Watchers Wait for Bargains 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of people interested in buying a transcript of Betty 
Broderick's first murder trial. So far, though, no sales. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, defense attorneys, journalists and the CBS entertainment division 
have shown interest. But nobody wants to buy the first copy and pay full price. 
</P>
<P>
The first copy of the estimated 3,000-page transcript will cost about $6,720. 
Subsequent copies are about $2,520. 
</P>
<P>
By law, the transcript is owned by the court reporter. The amount that can be 
charged per page for a transcript is set by court regulation. 
</P>
<P>
For budget-conscious Betty-watchers, a transcript of just her three days of 
testimony should go for around $500, once the first full transcript is sold.

SAN DIEGO AND THE PERSIAN GULF CRISIS; 
</P>
<P>
KUWAITI RECALLS FLIGHT FROM TERROR, VOWS HE WILL RETURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It was like confronting some gorilla-size bouncer who decides who can enter a 
swank nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
But for this Kuwaiti, the bouncer was an armed Iraqi soldier, deciding who 
could get out. 
</P>
<P>
Three times in 10 days, 28-year-old Waheed, who doesn't want his last name made 
public, drove to the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia border, hoping that he would be 
allowed to leave his homeland for San Diego, rejoining his wife of seven years 
and their 2 1/2-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
But there were no clear rules on how to get out of Kuwait. There was little 
that made sense those days. It was the capricious decision of an Iraqi military 
officer, guarding the border like it was his, that decided the fate of Kuwaitis 
trying to flee their ravaged country, where countrymen had been tortured or 
killed and where homes had been stripped and torched, the pillars of smoke 
wafting across the city's skyscape as an ever-present reminder of a nation 
occupied. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on "how you looked," Waheed said, some Kuwaitis were allowed to 
leave. Others would be sent back to Kuwait City. And pity the ones who, worst 
of all, would be ordered to Baghdad for an uncertain future of manual labor. 
Perhaps they looked like Kuwaiti soldiers or resistance fighters, Waheed 
figured. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd say to one person, Go. And to another person, Back." 
</P>
<P>
Depending on how you looked. What kind of a gamble was this? 
</P>
<P>
Waheed didn't know just how to look. 
</P>
<P>
He tried first on Nov. 15, approaching the border and confronting the Iraqi 
army lieutenant. In front of him, several had been cleared to leave the 
country, after first turning over their passports, their birth certificates, 
citizenship identification papers, their driver's licenses, their vehicle's 
license plates, their car registrations and whatever money they had. 
</P>
<P>
Others were turned back, with no explanation. And one car was allowed to 
proceed -- only to have its tires then shot out by laughing Iraqis. 
</P>
<P>
Waheed took a deep breath as he was 
</P>
<P>
measured by the lieutenant of the occupying army. "He told me to go back. You 
don't know why. You don't ask. If you argue, they send you to Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Waheed tried again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the same lieutenant. He seemed to recognize me immediately, even though 
he had been looking at so many people. He wouldn't even look at my papers. He 
just said, 'Back.' " 
</P>
<P>
On Nov. 25, Waheed tried a third time. Things seemed better until the Iraqis 
asked for his driver's license. "I didn't want to give it up. I wanted to have 
proof of who I was when I got into Saudi Arabia. So I told them I didn't have a 
driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
"They sent me back." 
</P>
<P>
Waheed gave up the notion of returning to San Diego. He returned to Kuwait City 
-- where he had lived for nearly three months without his wife and child -- and 
resigned himself to continuing his work with the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
"I had heard from the American Embassy that my wife and child were fine. And so 
I decided to stay, to help my country. I have to help my people." 
</P>
<P>
His wife and daughter -- who needed surgery to fix a hole in her heart as well 
as repair a defective valve -- had been allowed to leave Kuwait in early 
September, when Jesse Jackson visited Iraq and arranged for the release of 
pregnant and ailing women and children. 
</P>
<P>
His wife flew to San Diego, where her parents live and where he had met her in 
1982, while he was attending an aviation school here to become an airline 
operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
The couple had returned to Kuwait in 1986, living in an apartment not far from 
his parents' home. Life was good; he worked for Kuwait Airways, and their 
daughter was born. 
</P>
<P>
But, with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, life turned topsy-turvy. They 
stayed at their apartment, seldom venturing outside, until his wife's and 
daughter's passage to the United States was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Then, Waheed worked with the resistance. 
</P>
<P>
His job, he said, was to help get food to the 19 Americans and other foreigners 
hiding out in Kuwait that he personally knew of, after first shepherding the 
ones who lived near Kuwait City's beachfront to other, safer parts of the city 
where they would be harder to find. He also helped forge new documents -- 
turning American and British citizens into, say, Australian or New Zealand or 
Swiss citizens, in case that might eventually help their cause. 
</P>
<P>
"Many foreigners -- American and British -- were kept in the homes of large 
Kuwaiti families, and, when the Iraqi solders would come, they would be hidden 
in basements. When the Iraqis passed, they would go back upstairs, and live 
with the family," he said. 
</P>
<P>
During August, September and October, he said, Kuwaitis between the ages of 15 
and 45 were ordered to stay in their homes all the time; the younger and older 
ones had to stay inside after 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
During those next three months, he said, he saw Kuwaitis killed and tortured, 
and their homes burned. 
</P>
<P>
"If a house was empty for three days in a row, the soldiers would go into it 
and take everything out," he said. Many homes were empty because, with the 
insufferable August heat, a majority of the Kuwaitis were out of the country, 
anyway, on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldiers would load everything onto trailers. Furniture, appliances, 
everything. They would even bring in cranes to remove air conditioners. Then, 
they would set the house on fire. Hundreds of houses would be burning any given 
time." 
</P>
<P>
He heard through the grapevine that thousands of Kuwaitis had been killed, and 
it's a figure he doesn't challenge. He saw five bodies on his street alone, 
including that of a 16-year-old boy. 
</P>
<P>
"He worked at a bakery, and one day Iraqi solders went to him, demanding food. 
He refused. He said he didn't have to give them anything, because he only had 
enough flour for his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
"They left, and came back later with others and put the boy in a Jeep. That 
night, they came back with him and left him in front of his home. His neck was 
cut, from ear to ear, and he bled to death. Two armed military personnel stood 
about 200 yards away, and yelled, 'Don't touch him. He is an example for the 
whole neighborhood, not to try anything with us.' And all he did was work at a 
bakery." 
</P>
<P>
That's the way the Iraqis operated, he said: picking up men -- and boys -- they 
didn't like for some reason. Maybe it was the way they looked. And they'd be 
secreted away, sometimes for a month or longer. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, about 6:30 in the morning, a bus with soldiers would drive down the 
street, and they'd take the person out, and knock on the front door of his 
home, and, when the family opened the door, they'd cut his neck or shoot him in 
the head, for the family to see, and leave him." 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the Iraqis just played with the Kuwaiti people, a deadly play for 
their own enjoyment, Waheed said. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a friend who was picked up. I'm not sure why. They handcuffed him up to 
an oxygen tank that was used for hydraulics on a school playground, then they 
went to the roof of the school and began shooting towards him, just for fun. If 
they hit the tank, it would have exploded." 
</P>
<P>
Another friend, he said, was tortured by soldiers who put their lit cigarettes 
to his skin, or who shocked them with electrified wires. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the treatment was less physical, but more insidious. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd just slap you around, or spit in your face, or call your wife a whore, 
and you had to say, 'Thank you, sir.' Because, if you resisted, they'd take you 
away. They wanted you always to feel insecure." 
</P>
<P>
And there was always the unsettling sound of gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
"Before Aug. 2, if you heard gunfire, you knew it was someone hunting in the 
desert. Now, when you'd hear it, you wonder if a friend was just killed." 
</P>
<P>
The mood inside Kuwait improved markedly, he said, after the United Nations 
Security Council issued its Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq's withdrawal from the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"You wouldn't believe the relief and the excitement that caused," he said. 
"People are afraid to leave their homes, but after the United Nations 
resolution, they got the faith and the hope into them more than ever, because 
they now know that the whole world is committed to us. 
</P>
<P>
"Before that, we didn't know what was going to happen to us. We felt the world 
was only concerned about protecting Saudi Arabia and the other (Persian Gulf) 
countries. We didn't really think anybody cared about Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"This whole matter isn't over oil. This guy, Saddam Hussein, is a threat to the 
entire Middle East, and the people themselves. This guy will go on and on until 
he controls everything, and the Middle East will be a disaster. He has to be 
stopped." 
</P>
<P>
But Waheed decided he had to leave Kuwait himself when he got word through a 
friend that his wife was now ill in San Diego, and that doctors were getting 
ready to operate on his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"It's important to them, now, that I am with them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
So Waheed tried one more time to leave his country. 
</P>
<P>
"If I didn't make it this time, I was going to try to sneak across the desert. 
My mother and father and brothers were telling me it was time to leave, because 
my wife and daughter needed me more than they did." 
</P>
<P>
The two men decided to drive to the border in the middle of the night, to 
assure them an early place in line in case the Iraqi soldiers arbitrarily cut 
off passage at the 50th, or 75th, or 100th vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
At 2 in the morning on Dec. 1, he said goodby to his parents and drove the hour 
in a Chevrolet Cabriolet to the border. They were 25th in the line, which would 
grow to 300 vehicles by sunrise. 
</P>
<P>
At 6:30, the day's routine started. "I waited for the lieutenant to look at me 
and send me back again," Waheed said. "But this time, it was fine. They 
searched the car and checked for our documents, and let us go to the next 
checkpoint." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, they got to their last roadblock before freedom: a 
highway rest stop with a restaurant and an emergency medical aid station. 
</P>
<P>
"We got out of our cars and emptied our pockets. They took everything. They 
searched the car for money and for pictures and video tapes, because they 
didn't want anything leaving the country that could be used against them. They 
took the license plate, the registration, everything. But we hid some money, 
that was rolled up and stuck beneath the underside of the car." 
</P>
<P>
And they were freed. 
</P>
<P>
After driving down the six-lane asphalt highway for another 20 minutes, they 
arrived at the Saudi checkpoint -- where friendly soldiers greeted them. 
</P>
<P>
A six-hour car drive later, the two men arrived at the Saudi capital of Riyadh. 
Still ahead was the 26-hour journey to San Diego -- by way of Frankfurt, 
London, Seattle and Los Angeles -- and to the arms of his wife, "who looked 
terrific." 
</P>
<P>
But first, in Riyadh, Waheed had to get a passport. 
</P>
<P>
"The American Embassy there invited me to emigrate. They arranged for the plane 
ticket, and they offered me a green card. But I went to the Kuwait Embassy and 
got a Kuwaiti passport, because I want to tell the whole world that I am still 
Kuwaiti," Waheed said. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I am home, in San Diego. But this is not my real home. I'm going back to 
Kuwait. I consider myself now on vacation. I'm going home very soon, God 
willing."

PSYCHIATRIC WARD TREATS WOMEN ONLY; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: ADMINISTRATORS DESCRIBE THE UNIT AS A HAVEN FOR RAPE VICTIMS AND OTHERS 
WITH GENDER-RELATED PROBLEMS. CRITICS SAY IT'S A MARKETING GIMMICK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A private psychiatric hospital in Thousand Oaks has opened the county's first 
ward exclusively for women, a controversial new wing staffed primarily by women 
and designed to tackle gender-related problems. 
</P>
<P>
Although Charter Hospital administrators describe the third-floor unit as a 
haven for rape victims and women who suffer from depression or eating 
disorders, the hospital's critics and competitors dismiss it as little more 
than a clever marketing gimmick. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some psychiatric experts emphasize that women, even those brutalized 
by members of the opposite sex, should be hospitalized with men. To isolate 
women, they argue, only makes it more difficult for them to re-enter a society 
filled with men. 
</P>
<P>
Charter's directors agree that mixed groups may be helpful during the latter 
stages of therapy; however, they stress that initially some women need to move 
slowly in a secure environment. Eighty percent of the patients in the unit, 
which has operated for less than three months, have been victims of physical or 
sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of women out there suffering and I want to provide a safe 
place for them where they can come together and work together," said Dr. Uzma 
Khalid, the unit's founder. 
</P>
<P>
Located near Westlake High School, Charter is one of four private psychiatric 
hospitals in Ventura County. The nine-month-old hospital reserves 21 of its 80 
beds for women. Treatment costs about $825 a day. 
</P>
<P>
Since the unit opened in early October, about 30 women have been counseled 
there. A usual course of treatment lasts about four weeks, with patients 
attending group therapy sessions that include psychodrama role-playing and 
other techniques. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent autumn afternoon, patients gathered in one of the day rooms for a 
therapy session aimed at encouraging them to talk about painful experiences. 
Eleven women sat stiffly in a circle, some shaking their feet in nervous 
tension. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a child I was very lonely," one woman began. In soft, soothing 
tones, the therapist pried, pushing the woman to recall being molested by her 
brother. Eventually the woman grew angry and started to cry. Someone passed her 
a box of tissues. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought if I told anyone they'd think I was dirty," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"So did I," another woman agreed softly. "I can relate," added a third. 
</P>
<P>
Although the patients' conditions range from depression to bulimia, the 
experiences that lead to problems are often similar because the women are 
struggling in a male-dominated society, said Pary R. Banki, a Westlake Village 
therapist who conducted the session that afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Banki supports conducting group therapy sessions exclusively with women to 
allow patients to share their common experiences. 
</P>
<P>
For example, when Joanne, 41, entered Charter after she lost a baby in her 
sixth month of pregnancy, she said that talking with other women who had lost 
children gave her great comfort. The miscarriage, Joanne's second, catapulted 
her into a severe depression and eventually into Charter Hospital in October, 
where she became one of the first patients at the women's unit. 
</P>
<P>
"Men aren't always the right people to be discussing these things with," said 
Joanne, who asked that her real name not be used. "A man doesn't know what it's 
like to be pregnant and having a baby growing inside of you." 
</P>
<P>
The unit's critics, including other private psychiatric hospitals in the 
county, contend that in the real world women and men must interact and should 
be forced to do so in therapy. That is the approach used at Vista Del Mar 
Hospital in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't seen enough of a need to develop a special program all around" 
women, said Lynn Matthews, the hospital's director of marketing. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Rogoff, clinical program coordinator at Pacific Shores Hospital in Oxnard, 
echoed those sentiments. She said most women's issues, such as sexual abuse or 
domestic violence, also involve men and should be dealt with among men who may 
not pose the same threat. 
</P>
<P>
Charter's administrators do not dispute the need for its patients to have 
therapy in groups that include men later in their recovery. But some women, 
particularly those who have been victims of male aggression, want or even need 
to be in an all-female environment. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a need for women on a daily basis not to have to confront men and 
reawaken the hurts and pains that will make it difficult," said Susan Anderson, 
the unit's nurse manager. Some women, she said, are simply not comfortable 
discussing their experiences in front of men. 
</P>
<P>
Khalid referred to national studies to underscore the need for a women-only 
unit. Statistics show that one in four women suffer from depression compared to 
one in 10 men. Furthermore, women are more often the victims of rape and 
incest, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But Dr. Ron Thurston, president-elect of the Southern California Psychiatric 
Assn., fails to see the need for a women-only unit. "I hope people go to 
hospitals for better reasons than for being women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Specialized units of this type are often little more than marketing tools, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Thurston stressed that he was not referring specifically to Charter, 
he pointed out that public psychiatric clinics never need to advertise because 
they are overpopulated. 
</P>
<P>
"The distortion is that we have mentally ill people sleeping under bridges 
while certain sectors of health care are advertising for services for women's 
needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, Ventura County had no private psychiatric hospital. Today, at 
least four are competing for people's insurance dollars, Thurston said. That 
competition forces private hospitals to tailor programs to interest specific 
types of people. 
</P>
<P>
"The commercial hospitals do direct advertising on the radio to people with 
insurance money to spend," Thurston said. 
</P>
<P>
Pine Grove Hospital in Canoga Park opened the San Fernando Valley's first 
women's unit almost two years ago. The 14-bed unit charges about $1,000 a day 
and offers programs similar to those provided by Charter. 
</P>
<P>
Pine Grove patients "get exactly what we're marketing," said Donna Burns, 
program director and founder of the hospital's women's program. "It was my goal 
to develop a women's program for women who would never come into a hospital 
environment because of the stigma." 
</P>
<P>
Like Charter, the unit employs an all-female nursing staff with male therapists 
available for those patients who request them. 
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there should be a healthy balance, but we want to make sure 
that the nursing staff is female so they can come out at night in their pajamas 
and feel OK," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Governmental and private agencies that monitor psychiatry do not keep data on 
the number of women's units throughout the country, but those in the profession 
believe that hospitals began specializing care toward women about five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
The trend seems to parallel the evolution of women's roles, which now include 
careers as well as primary responsibility for children and aging parents. It 
also comes at a time when medicine in general has become more specialized, 
often focusing on individual areas of study. 
</P>
<P>
"Part of the advantage of grouping patients at all is having patients with 
common problems together," said Dr. Nada Logan, chairwoman of the American 
Psychiatric Assn.'s committee on women and director of psychiatric education at 
the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
"There are certain kinds of symptoms, disorders and stresses that are much more 
common in one gender than in another," Logan said. "Depression is very common 
in women. Eating disorders are much more common in women than men. Women still 
bear the vast majority of responsibility for care of dependent persons in 
families, be they children or be they elderly. That's an enormous life demand." 
</P>
<P>
If specialized programs can make psychiatry more "user friendly," more people 
may feel comfortable asking for help, said Joel Yager, a professor in the 
department of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences at UCLA's School of 
Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
"If, in fact, it attracts and provides good service to people who need it . . . 
then that's a benefit," Yager said. "If there are women who for whatever 
prejudices believe they'll be more comfortable" in an all-women's unit, 
"they're more likely to go."

COUNTY WILL WARM UP A BIT AFTER RECORD LOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After producing a record-breaking low temperature Sunday in San Diego, swirling 
snow on outlying mountain roads and damaging some avocado groves, the worst of 
the Arctic Express that invaded the county over the weekend should be over, 
forecasters said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
With the snow on the distant mountains visible Sunday from downtown San Diego, 
forecasters predicted that days will be increasingly warmer but that nights 
will remain cold through Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Nightly lows, however, were expected to warm a bit from the record cold Sunday 
at San Diego's Lindbergh Field -- 36 degrees, one degree colder than the 
37-degree reading that had stood as the low mark for Dec. 23 since 1891. The 
lowest low Sunday in the county was all of 7 degrees at Mt. Laguna, National 
Weather Service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Though the worst of the cold wave arrived early Sunday morning, forecasters 
warned avocado and citrus growers that temperatures in the groves and orchards 
might remain in the mid-20s through the next few nights, cold enough to cause 
crop damage. 
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, avocado producers "definitely suffered some damage," said 
Phil Henry, vice president of Henry Avocado Co. in Escondido, one of the 
largest independent avocado packing houses in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
However, the extent of the damage to the county's avocado crop, the largest in 
California, won't be known until workers walk through the groves today, Henry 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Already, growers have "seen some damage to the leaves on the avocado trees," 
Henry said Sunday. But, since many groves were dampened Saturday night with 
40-degree water and because a slight breeze very early Sunday appeared to have 
mixed warmer air with the cold, growers were "cautiously optimistic," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County produces about 40% of the state's avocado crop. California's 
avocado industry is a $200-million annual business. 
</P>
<P>
California Highway Patrol officers reported Sunday that holiday traffic was 
slowed by blowing snow near Julian and high winds on Interstate 8 from Kitchen 
Creek Road east to the Imperial County line. Chains were suggested or required 
on various mountain roads in northern reaches of San Diego County, officers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Even with the snow and wind, officers reported no serious accidents on the 
roads. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, temperatures dropped Sunday to 15 at Julian, 14 at Palomar 
Mountain and 12 at Cuyamaca Rancho State Park, the Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Around the county's coast and its inland valleys, lows Sunday were 25 at Alpine 
and Del Mar, 26 at El Cajon and Escondido and 29 at Oceanside and Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
The unusual cold produced heavy demand for home-warming gas but "nothing 
unusual," said a spokeswoman for San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. 
</P>
<P>
The utility supplied about 200 million cubic feet of gas Sunday, well below the 
peak figure of 350 million cubic feet, said spokeswoman Barbara Jarvis. "We're 
fine," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In Imperial Beach, a heater apparently ignited a dry Christmas tree, sparking a 
fire early Sunday that caused $250,000 damage to a two-story house in the 700 
block of 3rd Street, San Diego County sheriff's deputies said. Five adults and 
two children escaped from the house, deputies said. 
</P>
<P>
County, city and privately run shelters were open Sunday around the county, 
including the city's traditional holiday shelter in downtown San Diego, near 
City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The forecast through Tuesday, according to the weather service, is for 
occasional clouds but no rain throughout San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Along the coast, highs should be 53 to 58 today, warming Tuesday to 56 to 63. 
Lows today should be 34 to 44, the service said. 
</P>
<P>
Inland, highs today are due to be 56 to 63, then up slightly Tuesday, 58 to 65. 
Lows today should be 29 to 39. 
</P>
<P>
In the mountains, highs should be 30 to 37 today, 38 to 45 Tuesday. Lows today 
were forecast to drop to 18 to 28. 
</P>
<P>
Desert highs of 55 to 60 were forecast for today, 58 to 65 Tuesday. Tonight, 
lows should drop to 25 to 35, the service said.

EVERY CORD COUNTS IN BUYING FIREWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRSTEN LEE SWARTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
People crave a crackling blaze in the fireplace during the holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
"As the holidays approach it becomes a 'thing' in Southern California to have a 
fire because it's the closest thing you can get to holiday spirit around here," 
said Martin Cobbs, an inspector with the county's Weights and Measures 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
Cobbs cautions, however, that when buying wood, every cord counts. 
</P>
<P>
A cord is the standard measurement used for stacked wood, equaling 128 cubic 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
State law requires that firewood be sold by the cord or in fractions of a cord. 
</P>
<P>
But many consumers, unaware of the law, are vulnerable to being shortchanged, 
especially by part-time wood sellers also unfamiliar with measure requirements, 
Cobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
In November, at least six people complained to county officials that they had 
not received the amount of wood that they had paid for and in December several 
more people called in to complain, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The division will investigate dealers who have not delivered the proper amount 
of wood, but it helps if the consumer has stacked and measured the wood before 
paying for it, Cobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
One hundred twenty-eight cubic feet can be measured by stacking the wood to 
match dimensions of eight feet in length, four feet in height and four feet in 
width, Cobbs said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had problems in the past with people not knowing what the cubic footage 
is," Cobbs said. "If they don't know they'll never check." 
</P>
<P>
The division does not control the price of wood, which varies depending on the 
dealer and the wood type. 
</P>
<P>
Some wood sellers list a cord of oak at about an average of $200, eucalyptus at 
about $160 and avocado at about $110. 
</P>
<P>
Oak and eucalyptus wood is harder in texture and burns slowly, producing more 
heat. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado is much softer and generally is used by people who burn a fire for 
aesthetic reasons, said Jim Kenton, who has been selling firewood for 18 years 
as a sideline to his tree-pruning business. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's stacked . . . it's not hard to figure out," Kenton, owner of Sunrise 
Tree and Property Maintenance, said of the measurement requirement. 
</P>
<P>
Georgine Ryan, owner of Gold Coast Firewood, added that the law keeps merchants 
honest. 
</P>

CARAVAN OF CAROLERS SPREADS YULE CHEER

<P>
A festive group of about 35 carolers took to the Ojai streets on horseback and 
in horse-drawn carriages Sunday to serenade nursing home residents with 
Christmas music. 
</P>
<P>
Brisk temperatures, frosted lawns and icicles hanging from tree branches lent a 
Christmas atmosphere to the caravan threading its way through the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fourth year that the old-fashioned caroling has taken place. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Arriaga, who accompanied his wife Barbara and two children, called the 
event "a chance to give, in the form of a song, to people who might not 
otherwise hear this music." 
</P>
<P>
A series of mishaps, however, almost kept the singers from spreading their 
holiday cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The problems began as the caravan headed along Rice Road outside of Ojai, when 
one of the riders fell from his horse. 
</P>
<P>
He was not seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
Then, at the first two stops, a convalescent center at the Ojai Valley Hospital 
and the Grey Gables nursing home, supervisors seemed surprised at the sight of 
the carolers, although Norm Davis of Ojai said he advised them of the group's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
At both homes, the singers were almost drowned out by ringing alarm bells, 
triggered by water leaks from pipes burst by the overnight cold. 
</P>
<P>
At Grey Gables, residents were unaware that the carolers were outside and 
remained in their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But at the third stop, Mountain Vista Manor on East Oak Street, half a dozen 
residents emerged into the chilly air and joined in as the carolers sang 
"Silent Night," "Jingle Bells" and other traditional songs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very nice," Mountain View resident Helmi Eson, 82, said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they should do it every year." ADRIANNE GOODMAN

U.S. Coast Guard and Navy officials suspended at sundown Sunday a search for a 
scuba diver reported missing from a boat four miles off Port Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Oregon man, whose identity was not released pending 
notification of relatives, was with friends on a 26-foot pleasure boat when he 
made the dive about 11:30 a.m., apparently to search for pieces of a sunken 
boat in 80 feet of water, said Petty Officer Robert Beals of the Coast Guard's 
Long Beach station. 
</P>
<P>
The man's diving tank contained enough air for a 30-minute dive, Beals said. A 
companion on the boat sent out a distress signal when the diver failed to 
surface after 1 1/2 hours, Coast Guard officials said. 
</P>
<P>
A Coast Guard helicopter and two cutters were joined by a helicopter from the 
Point Mugu naval station in the search, which was hampered by three- to 
four-foot waves and winds up to 25 knots, Beals said. 
</P>
<P>
Coast Guard Petty Officer Jim Schweikhardt said officials "searched the area 
thoroughly and we couldn't locate him." There were no plans to resume the 
search today, he said. ADRIANNE GOODMAN

NEIGHBORS FEARING RISK OF CANCER OPPOSE 2 DWP EXPANSION PROJECTS; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: FOES CITE STUDIES LINKING HIGH-CURRENT POWER LINES TO AN INCREASED 
THREAT TO CHILDREN. THE UTILITY SAYS BOTH PLANS ARE NEEDED TO MEET DEMAND.

<P>
A controversy over potential cancer risks from electromagnetic fields is 
stirring opposition in the San Fernando Valley to two proposals to expand the 
city's electrical transmission and distribution systems. 
</P>
<P>
In Arleta, angry residents are signing petitions against a plan by the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power to build a new electric distributing 
station along the 13200 block of Branford Street. A few miles west, some 
neighbors are criticizing plans to install a third transmission tower and two 
more high-voltage power lines on an existing transmission line corridor linking 
Granada Hills and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials say both projects are needed to meet growing electric demand. 
</P>
<P>
But opponents say the projects may be dangerous, citing studies that show a 
small increase in the risk of cancer risk among children living near 
high-current power lines. A variety of studies have also found higher rates of 
cancer among workers in electrical occupations, such as utility linemen, 
electricians and power station operators. 
</P>
<P>
Other research has found no cancer link, and it remains uncertain if there is 
any hazard from electric and magnetic fields. The EM fields are invisible lines 
of force that radiate outward from every wire and device that carries electric 
current, dropping off sharply with distance from the source. 
</P>
<P>
In a draft report earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
described EM fields "from power lines and perhaps other sources in the home as 
a possible, but not proven, cause of cancer in humans." Despite the ambiguous 
conclusion, there were delays in releasing the report due to White House 
concern that it would panic the public. 
</P>
<P>
Concern already has run high in communities across the country. In the San 
Fernando Valley, residents in two neighborhoods accuse the DWP of 
irresponsibility for pushing ahead with expansion plans while the controversy 
rages. 
</P>
<P>
For their part, DWP officials contend that even if EM fields pose a risk, the 
two proposed projects will not increase human exposures to the fields. 
</P>
<P>
The Arleta project has brought turmoil to a neighborhood of modest, 
single-family houses, where at least two families close to the station site vow 
to move away if it is built. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy with the area and I can't even afford to move anywhere else," said 
George Heidlberg, who has lived for a dozen years across from the proposed 
Branford Street site. But he said there is no way he would stay if the project 
is built. "I just don't want to take chances with the life of my little girl." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Zuccolillo, whose home is separated from the proposed station by the 
width of the Tujunga Wash said she feels "it's dangerous, yes, but can I prove 
it? No. No more than they can prove that it's not . . . . For that reason 
alone, I think they ought to put it somewhere else." 
</P>
<P>
Zuccolillo, who has three children, said she "wouldn't feel safe staying here" 
if the station is built. "If in 20 years they decide these . . . power 
facilities do cause cancer or other health effects, what do I do then?" 
</P>
<P>
Opponents are seething most over the DWP's decision to forgo a detailed 
environmental study on the project and instead issue a "negative declaration," 
a statement that the project has no potentially significant environmental 
effects. 
</P>
<P>
Given concerns about EM fields, a negative declaration is "totally off the 
wall," said Joe Bonilla, an Arleta resident and treasurer of the Arleta Chamber 
of Commerce and Residents Assn., which is spearheading opposition to the 
project. It appears department officials have "been in hiding for years and 
just stepped out of a time warp," Bonilla said. 
</P>
<P>
A distributing station transforms high-voltage current into lower-voltage power 
for distribution to nearby houses and businesses. The DWP operates about 130 
distributing stations citywide, many of them surrounded by masonry walls that 
are architecturally treated to look like Mediterranean or Spanish-style 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials say the new station is needed to avoid overloading four other 
East Valley distributing stations that now serve the Arleta and Pacoima areas. 
The department has purchased options on two adjacent houses on Branford Street 
that would be razed to make room for the $9-million facility. Plans call for 
construction to start late next year and the station to be in service by March, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy actually began as a zoning battle, with residents worried the 
station would be a foot in the door for commercial development in their 
neighborhood of small, single-family houses. The DWP needs a conditional use 
permit from the city Planning Commission to build the station. 
</P>
<P>
Merging health and zoning concerns, opponents have urged the DWP to build the 
station on property the department already owns at Sheldon Street and Arleta 
Avenue, about a half-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials say the station would cost more and be less effective if built at 
that site, due to power losses from running distribution lines a longer 
distance to the service area. 
</P>
<P>
As for the negative declaration, DWP officials contend that the distributing 
station will not increase the strength of EM fields in nearby yards and houses. 
Thus, they say, it will have no environmental impact. 
</P>
<P>
However, they acknowledged in interviews that the conclusion was based on 
limited measurements at a few distributing stations. 
</P>
<P>
Those measurements, they said, showed magnetic fields at the outer wall of 
distributing stations ranging from less than 2 milligauss to 9.5 milligauss. A 
milligauss is a unit of measure of magnetic field strength. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, a typical househas a magnetic field of up to 1 milligauss, with 
higher readings near operating appliances. In one study, an increased risk of 
childhood cancer was associated with field strengths in the home of about 2 to 
3 milligauss. Field strengths fall dramatically with distance, prompting the 
DWP to conclude that people near the distributing station would not be exposed 
to elevated fields. 
</P>
<P>
DWP officials said they are taking more measurements at distributing stations 
and will present the data at a public meeting in Arleta late in January. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not want the general public to perceive that there's no sensitivity to 
their concerns," said Bernard V. Palk, the DWP's assistant chief engineer for 
power. 
</P>
<P>
He said the "public perception" of a health risk will be considered by the 
Board of Water and Power Commissioners, which oversees department operations. 
The board -- recently stocked with environmentally minded commissioners in a 
shake-up ordered by Mayor Tom Bradley -- is expected to decide early next year 
whether to approve the negative declaration. 
</P>
<P>
"If they believe it will need to be addressed in a full-blown environmental 
impact report," an EIR will be ordered, Palk said. 
</P>
<P>
A draft EIR has already been issued on the proposed Rinaldi-Northridge 
transmission line project, extending 6.7 miles from an electrical receiving 
station at 15901 Rinaldi St. in Granada Hills to a second receiving station at 
18821 Parthenia St. in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
The existing right of way, 220 feet wide in most places, contains two 
transmission towers, each supporting two 230-kilovolt transmission lines. 
</P>
<P>
The $14.5-million expansion would involve erecting a third tower between the 
other two to carry two more 230-kV lines. 
</P>
<P>
If commissioners approved the project, plans call for construction to start in 
September, 1992, and take nine months. DWP officials said one of the two new 
lines will be needed by 1993 and the other by 1998, but that both might be 
installed at once. 
</P>
<P>
Power lines can be "phased", or arrayed in such a way that magnetic fields from 
parallel lines tend to cancel one another. Department officials said they plan 
to array the new lines so that field strengths at the edge of the right of way 
will be slightly lower than they are now. 
</P>
<P>
"We can build it this way, and the fields will go down slightly," said Mike 
Reavis, a supervising engineer with DWP. "What effect that has on health we 
can't say," said Reavis. Opponents of the project are skeptical. "I cannot see 
how adding one-third the power can be a health benefit to me," said Roger S. 
Waldbaum, who lives in a townhouse in the shadow of the transmission lines near 
the intersection of Devonshire Street and Lindley Avenue. "It flies in the face 
of reality." 
</P>
<P>
"I remember 'way back when the cigarette companies claimed that smoking was 
good for you," Waldbaum said. "It was only 30 years later that independent 
research proved that smoking caused cancer -- much too late to help all those 
who died."

AN INSIDIOUS REJUVENATION OF THE OLD LEFT; 
</P>
<P>
SOCIALISM'S DICTATE OF CLASS CONFLICT SPROUTS IN TRENDY CAUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES KRAUTHAMMER, Charles Krauthammer writes a syndicated column in 
Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Committee for the Free World, the most spirited anti-communist voice in 
post-Vietnam America, closed shop this week. "We've won, goodby," explained 
founder Midge Decter. The most skeptical coroner has spoken. Communism is dead. 
</P>
<P>
Another story, however, has been largely missed: Socialism is dead, too. At a 
recent gathering of the left (for a memorial tribute to radical historian 
William Appleman Williams), fellow historian Christopher Lasch, with admirable 
candor, said this: 
</P>
<P>
"We have to ask ourselves whether (Gorbachev) isn't presiding not just over the 
collapse of the Soviet empire but over the collapse of socialism as well. It is 
all very well to argue . . . that the socialist ideal was never to be confused 
with (Soviet-style) 'actually existing socialism.' But the whole point of 
Marxian socialism as distinguished from utopian socialism, if anybody 
remembers, was precisely that it was not merely a speculative ideal." 
</P>
<P>
Socialism, despite what Gorbachev pretends, was never the doctrine of loving 
thy neighbor as thyself. It is a political doctrine of class conflict rooted in 
a rejection of private property and a faith in "social control" -- that is, 
political control -- of the means of production. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the returns are in. Socialism is a prescription for economic ruin. But if 
socialism is finished, what's left of the left? Judging from its recent 
activities, it is improvising well: 
</P>
<P>
1) Environmentalism. A natural successor to Marxism. Europe's Green parties led 
the way, showing friends of the Earth the connection between opposition to 
development and anti-Americanism. There is a certain shamelessness in the left 
adopting the environment as its cause, considering the indescribable 
environmental wreckage left by "actually existing socialism" in Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union. Environmentalism is nonetheless the perfect escape hatch 
for the left, because it enables the left to do precisely what it tried to do 
under the banner of socialism: allow educated elites to tell everyone else how 
to live. Social control is now asserted on behalf of the spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
2) Peace. With the gulf crisis, the left (with some help from the isolationist 
right) has been busy trying to revive the long-dormant anti-war movement. But 
here one gets the feeling of people going through the motions, of a reflexive, 
almost nostalgic anti-interventionism. 
</P>
<P>
After all, the last time the peace movement got terribly exercised it was to 
warn the world in panicked tones of the imminence of nuclear catastrophe and of 
the urgent need to take nuclear weapons out of the hands of Ronald Reagan. Now 
that a Third World adventurer and thug, a man who has used weapons of mass 
destruction in the past and has pledged to use them again, is about to get his 
hands on a nuclear arsenal, the anti-war left can find no "just war" reason to 
disarm him. 
</P>
<P>
This is more than inconsistency. This is bad faith. Hence, I suspect, the 
weakness of the peace movement so far. 
</P>
<P>
3) Deconstruction, a.k.a. the Balkanization of America. This is the major 
project of the left in the universities, the monastic refuge to which, like a 
defeated religious order, the most radical left has retreated. How to undermine 
a culture it cannot abide? By attacking its most central values: the idea of a 
common Western culture and the idea of a common American citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
How? By proclaiming and championing a new oppressed -- no longer the bloated 
and ungrateful working classes, but a new class of selected ethnic and gender 
groups. Blacks, Latinos, women, homosexuals, Native Americans -- the list is 
long, the bids are open -- are now wards of the left. 
</P>
<P>
In their name is launched an all-out assault, first, on America's cultural 
past. As John Searle points out in the New York Review of Books, the demand is 
not just for an expansion of the West's cultural canon to include works by 
women or people of color, but the destruction of this canon as representative 
of a white male-dominated system of cultural oppression. 
</P>
<P>
So much for Western Civ. The other attack -- on common citizenship -- consists 
of the division of Americans into a hierarchy of legally preferred groups based 
on race and gender. From Canada to Lebanon, every other multi-ethnic society 
that has attempted such tribal stratification has come to grief. The left, 
helped by a nobly motivated but intellectually bankrupt "civil-rights 
community," would march us just that way. 
</P>
<P>
Of the three projects, Balkanization is the most serious. America will survive 
both Saddam and the snail darter. But the setting of one ethnic group against 
another, the fracturing not just of American society but of the American idea, 
poses a threat that no outside agent in this post-Soviet world can match.

CLASS TAKES 'DONAHUE APPROACH'

<P>
Instructors of a speech class at Valley College that satisfies a state 
requirement for analytical-thinking credit follow what they call the "Phil 
Donahue approach to teaching." 
</P>
<P>
The course, taught by a method similar to that of a television talk show, 
generates student participation through discussions of current events no matter 
how controversial. 
</P>
<P>
Subjects range from the Middle East crisis to the Milli Vanilli lip-sync 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
Professors Jack Sterk and Jim Marteney developed the idea for the course -- 
called Speech 104 -- about 10 years ago when the state added a 
critical-thinking class to college graduation requirements. 
</P>
<P>
Both teach the course with the hopes of triggering responses from their 
students and using that feedback to illustrate the techniques of argumentation 
and persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is to engage information and make students respond and react. We want 
them to critically examine the situation," Marteney said. 
</P>
<P>
"We aggravate students in class because of the issues we talk about, but what 
we really look for is for the students to challenge themselves and defend 
themselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Marteney said the idea is to encourage student participation. 
</P>
<P>
"No one class is going to radically change a person, but we generally want the 
student to change and examine critically the methods of argumentation," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the course is popular with students, it is not easy, its teachers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"Speech 104 is a hard class because it makes students think," Sterk said.

Talkin' 'Bout Lawsuits: The rock band Van Halen filed a lawsuit against 2 Live 
Crew, claiming the rap group used a Van Halen guitar riff on their 
controversial album "As Nasty as They Wanna Be." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. District Court suit filed last week in Los Angeles seeks more than 
$300,000 for copyright infringement and unfair competition. At issue is 
guitarist Eddie Van Halen's famous refrain in the 1978 hit record "Ain't 
Talkin' 'Bout Love." The suit claims 2 Live Crew used the music for a song 
called "The Funk Shop" on the rap group's album. BETH KLEID

Megamates: Combine Jane Fonda and her media mogul fiance Ted Turner and you 
have People magazine's "Power Couple of 1990." The couple topped a list of 
megamates the magazine named in its Dec. 31 issue. 
</P>
<P>
Fonda and Turner went public with their wedding plans recently, saying they 
would be married in about a year. The couple rated highest in the survey based 
on categories including joint net worth, altruism, long-term relationship 
potential, public displays of affection, sex appeal and career ups and downs. 
Also included in the list of powerful pairs: Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria 
Schriver, Connie Chung and Maury Povich, Jane Pauley and Garry Trudeau, Don 
Johnson and Melanie Griffith, Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, Johnny Depp and 
Winona Ryder and Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, among others. BETH KLEID

Freebies: The nation's largest theater chains are giving away promotional 
samples of candy, popcorn and other goodies to regain revenue lost by cuts in 
on-screen advertising. United Artists, the largest movie chain with 2,500 
screens, handed out PB Max candy bars this month to patrons entering its 
theaters in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Cineplex Odeon, the second largest chain with 1,690 screens, handed out packs 
of sugar-free Dentyne chewing gum and samples of Hero's men's cologne at the 
end of the movies. One industry source estimates the nationwide distribution of 
a free product can generate up to $100,000 in ad revenues each month. Instead 
of paying for ads on screen, which audiences have rejected, companies pay a fee 
to the theater chains to hand out their products. BETH KLEID

WHISPERS SHOW THE REAL THING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It isn't often in the world of entertainment that someone who is short and 
chunky gets to lord it over someone who is lean and hunky. 
</P>
<P>
But in the aftermath of the Milli Vanilli scam, Walter Scott, one of the 
stubby, blocky-looking twins who front the Whispers, can be forgiven for taking 
a moment during the veteran R&amp;B group's early show Friday night at the 
Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim to crow about the value of substance over glitz. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are looking for some smoke to appear, or for somebody to disappear and 
reappear -- (this is the) wrong place," Scott told the audience, referring to 
Milli Vanilli's sleight-of-hand stage act. "Everything you hear tonight is 
real." 
</P>
<P>
While Milli Vanilli is fast becoming an old joke, the Whispers remain a steady 
standby after more than 20 years as a recording act. Their 75-minute show was 
the work of solid, if not extraordinary performers, B-students of soul who may 
not create soaring moments but who get the job of entertaining done in classy, 
confident fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Brothers Walter and Wallace (Scotty) Scott sang leads in closely matched voices 
that may not be striking or emotionally acute, but have enough range and smoky 
body to make for enjoyable listening. 
</P>
<P>
While nothing the Whispers sang holds up as an R&amp;B landmark, just about 
everything had an appealing melodic hook. Good singing was backed by a sharp 
and lively eight-man band, leaving no lapses or weaknesses to complain about. 
</P>
<P>
After 7 was scheduled to open, but after a 70-minute delay it was announced 
that the platinum-selling rookie vocal trio would not perform because of 
illness. MIKE BOEHM

THE WAGNER CHORALE CHRISTMAS PRESENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD S. GINELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was like old times at the Vallejo Drive Seventh-day Adventist Church in 
Glendale Saturday night, where the Roger Wagner Chorale presented another of 
its cherishable Christmas programs. The audience was sprinkled with alumni from 
past chorales -- and though Wagner was forced to conduct from a wheelchair this 
time, the veteran maestro displayed plenty of his usual feisty charm. 
</P>
<P>
But nostalgia was hardly the only force at work here. More than four years 
after his stormy retirement from the Los Angeles Master Chorale, Wagner 
continues to remind us from time to time of his matchless ability to draw sound 
from a group of mixed voices. 
</P>
<P>
One was transported to the not-so-distant past by the clear, bright, 
dynamically flexible singing from this 35-voice group -- with every word 
crisply enunciated. Even when working with such compact numbers, Wagner 
continues to draw a much richer bass sound from the men than do choirmasters 
with much larger forces. 
</P>
<P>
Wagner also put together a canny, mostly unhackneyed program with a clear 
historical progression -- sung either a cappella or with William Beck's support 
at the pipe organ. Starting in the Renaissance with the "Hodie Nobis" of Nanini 
and two versions of "Hodie Christus Natus Est" by Sweelink and Palestrina, 
Wagner worked his way up to the buoyant "Magnificat" that has been attributed 
to Pergolesi. 
</P>
<P>
Berlioz's wonderfully plaintive, fragile "L'Adieu des Bergers" from "L'Enfance 
du Christ," though rushed in the first two verses, paid off with a hushed, 
broader third verse (only to have the organ end in a different key). Moving 
into our century, Wagner followed Leo Sowerby's moody, harmonically 
sophisticated arrangement of "The Manger Carol" with Daniel Pinkham's sometimes 
tough, sometimes brightly syncopated, always interesting "Christmas Cantata." 
</P>
<P>
The more familiar Christmas fare was saved for the second half. Wagner's own 
"The Christmas Story According to St. Luke" -- written for a Tennessee Ernie 
Ford television special many years ago -- was a modest concoction that 
conveniently laced together several well-known carols with tasteful organ 
interludes and hyperdramatic narration by Burton York. 
</P>
<P>
Also in the second half, pianist/composer Jan Sanborn accompanied the chorale 
in her touching song, "No Longer a Baby," and the chorale deftly handled the 
off-kilter meters of John Gardner's "Tomorrow Will Be My Dancing Day." Two 
delectable encores wrapped up the package -- "He Is Born" and "Carol of the 
Bells." RICHARD S. GINELL

A CAPPELLA GROUP SINGS IN BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chauntecleer is the perky rooster that livens up Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales." 
Chanticleer, the all-male a cappella ensemble from San Francisco, makes no 
raucous sounds like its strident, bawdy namesake, but it alerts and captures 
the ear nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
Heard in a Christmas concert Friday at All Saints' Episcopal Church in Beverly 
Hills, the 12-member ensemble offered a varied program of Renaissance and 
traditional music, at times moving from one area of the resonant, unadorned 
church to another or reconfiguring into various combinations to enhance 
antiphonal or contrasting ensemble effects. 
</P>
<P>
Although the concert was the 15th this month for the ensemble -- formed in 1978 
by Louis Botto and conducted here by countertenor-music director Joseph 
Jennings -- the singers never sounded tired nor addressed the texts in anything 
but a fresh fashion. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout, the Chanticleer sound was rounded, full, pure and even from top to 
bottom and was presented authoritatively in a number of styles that suggested 
that the male a cappella repertory may be virtually unlimited. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the austere, slow-moving planes of sound in Thomas Stoltzer's "O 
admirabile commercium," sung here with wondrous clarity. Or the blossoming 
lines of Jean Mouton's "Ave Maria . . . Virgo Serena," unfolded with a sense of 
ease in loosening time's bonds. Or the grating, strange wanderings into bright 
tonal areas that suddenly shade over in Giovanni Gabrieli's "O magnum 
mysterium," explored by the singers with an aura of expectant discovery. 
</P>
<P>
The group knew how to vary pacing and style, however, so that the program did 
not become over-rarefied. They explored the rich folk literature with such 
works as a group of anonymous Spanish songs from the 14th to 16th centuries, 
beginning with a trio of tenors in the haunting, wailing lines of "O virgo 
splendens" and ending with the full ensemble in the earthy and vigorous "Riu, 
riu, chiu." 
</P>
<P>
For all that, the most overtly emotional peak of the program occurred with 
Franz Biebl's "Ave Maria," sung from the balcony at the back of the church. 
</P>
<P>
While the 20th-Century composer apparently earns no entry in the standard 
reference texts, Biebl has written a touching hymn to the Virgin that ends with 
a hushed hope for consolation at death. This final prayer was intoned by the 
singers with limpid modesty and deeply felt commitment, and respectful silence 
lingered after the close. 
</P>
<P>
The program ended in an upbeat mood, however, with a series of traditional 
favorites, such as "I saw three ships" and "O Holy Night," and a medley of 
spirituals, including "Go tell it on the mountain," arranged by Jennings. CHRIS 
PASLES

GRAHAM RAISES THE STANDARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD FEATHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Giorgio's Place is one of the Southland's less accessible jazz locations, but 
once found, in a large office building in Long Beach, it offers such rewards as 
the voice of Sandy Graham, who was on hand Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Long a local presence, Graham is a poised and ingratiating performer whose jazz 
inflections are immediately apparent. 
</P>
<P>
Making occasional and effective use of a personalized vibrato, she brings 
individuality to a generally well-selected group of standard songs, none of 
them excessively familiar. 
</P>
<P>
Opening with "You and the Night and the Music," a 1934 Howard Dietz-Arthur 
Schwartz collaboration, Graham sustained the rhythmically compelling mood that 
had been established in a preliminary instrumental set by the Vicki Von Eps 
Trio. Von Eps, an engaging soloist and intelligent accompanist, was hampered by 
the overloud bass of Bob Saravia. Tony Inzalaco on drums completed the 
threesome. 
</P>
<P>
Graham gave warmly sensitive readings of "Good Morning Heartache" and "Lover 
Man." Her closer was an unlikely selection: "Ace in the Hole" -- not the old 
barroom ballad but a much hipper song from a 1941 Cole Porter show. She brought 
to it an effervescence that marks all her up-tempo forays. 
</P>
<P>
Graham has a long track record as a first-rate purveyor of seldom-heard songs. 
It is high time to find room for her on the record scene, provided that 
unreconstructed singers still have a place in that money jungle. LEONARD

A WASHINGTON CLINIC SEEKS TO HELP REDUCE THE U.S. INFANT MORTALITY RATE. ACCESS 
IS GUARANTEED FOR ALL WOMEN AND INFANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl sits in a child's chair in a house a few miles from the 
Capitol. A 5-month-old boy lies in her lap. SWEET, reads the confetti-patterned 
sweat shirt pulled over his chubby chest. A tear rolls down the girl's cheek. 
</P>
<P>
She lost her first baby at age 16, she is telling a visitor. She was unhappy, 
neglecting meals, five months pregnant. Newly arrived from El Salvador, she had 
no family and no doctor. Alone at home one day, she realized she had had a 
miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Call an ambulance, a neighbor insisted. The girl balked: I had no money. How 
would I pay? She spent three days in a hospital where no one spoke Spanish. 
Don't cry, the baby's father kept saying. You'll have another baby. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, Andrea Diaz was pregnant again. This time, she learned of a clinic 
for poor Latino women, one of a number of programs that have sprung up recently 
as the District of Columbia has grappled with an infant death rate more than 
twice the national average. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea began going regularly to the townhouse on Columbia Road, descending into 
the little waiting room hung with Gauguin prints, where other Spanish-speaking 
women gathered, some pregnant, some not, their bundled and snow-suited babies 
in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Social workers comforted and supported Andrea. Nurse-midwives guided her 
through her pregnancy. She learned about health, nutrition, breast feeding and 
parenthood. She met other pregnant Salvadoran teen-agers. And last summer, she 
gave birth to a son. 
</P>
<P>
The clinic, known as Mary's Center, is founded on principles that many say 
could be the key to reducing infant death in the United States, a country where 
the infant death rate has gone from one of the best in the developed world in 
the 1950s to one of the worst. 
</P>
<P>
These principles already form the foundation of maternal and child health 
programs in more than a dozen foreign countries. Such countries have reduced 
their infant mortality rates in recent decades from well above that of the 
United States to well below. 
</P>
<P>
Those tenets include guaranteed access for all women and infants to maternity 
and pediatric care, reduction of the obstacles often involved in getting care, 
aggressive outreach and public education, and easy access to related services 
such as drug abuse treatment. 
</P>
<P>
So far, the new programs appear to have made little or no dent in Washington's 
statistics -- testimony to the complex nature of the problem, experts say. But 
they say the approach, if sustained and expanded, has a good chance of making a 
difference in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, the District of Columbia has made maternity care free to any woman 
with a family income below $20,000. A city policy (not always followed) 
promises no more than a two-week wait for an initial appointment at a city-run 
clinic. 
</P>
<P>
At Mary's Center, a private, nonprofit agency receiving some government 
support, the entire staff is bilingual. Nurse-midwives are on 24-hour call. 
Nurses visit all new mothers at home. The clinic also offers family planning, 
educational programs, turkeys at Thanksgiving. 
</P>
<P>
The city is also arranging for a range of drug treatment opportunities for 
pregnant addicts. If all goes as planned, there will be many programs -- from 
outpatient to long-term residential -- treating pregnant users, a group long 
excluded from treatment programs. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the district has dispatched a street-smart single parent, Twana 
Fortune, to roam the city's poorest wards in a red and gold "mobile maternity 
van," chauffeuring women to and from clinics, checking on new mothers and 
promoting prenatal and pediatric care. 
</P>
<P>
"It's empowering people to do the right thing," Fortune said recently. "I have 
not talked to anyone in my life that said they wanted a baby with health 
problems. Everybody wants a healthy baby. So it's a matter of leading them to 
the water. They're already thirsty." 
</P>
<P>
Washington is not the only area of the country attempting to reduce infant 
death, though it has been doing it longer than most and has more programs. 
Other states and cities are also experimenting with various forms of outreach, 
home visiting and easing of access to care. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, however, such programs have been piecemeal -- one run by a 
city, another by a state, another by a private foundation. Unlike in Western 
Europe, Scandinavia and Asia, there has been no national commitment in the 
United States to tackle the problem nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, most efforts have been financially hamstrung. 
</P>
<P>
In the District of Columbia, for example, just one clinic has evening hours. 
And it has them only once a week. Tight budgets forced all the other clinics to 
abandon the program -- even though it had hiked attendance at one facility by 
30%. 
</P>
<P>
One of two outreach vans, a 1969 camper used for prenatal exams, broke down 
within months of the program's inception. It remains unrepaired and unreplaced, 
while the other carts around a $600 mobile telephone that the district cannot 
afford to operate. 
</P>
<P>
Maria Gomez, the executive director of Mary's Center, estimates that the clinic 
turns away 10 needy women every day. Funded by federal, local and private 
money, the clinic lacks the funding, space and manpower to expand beyond 18 
deliveries a month. 
</P>
<P>
"Programs rise and fall," said Joan Paddock Maxwell, president of the Better 
Babies Project, a much-admired program of outreach to pregnant women in poor 
areas of Washington that came to an abrupt halt last summer after its federal, 
local and private funding ran out. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she said, private foundations that agree to fund pilot projects are 
unwilling to fund programs on an ongoing basis. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, experts say, is one of priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"We know what to do. We just lack the will to get it done," said Jennifer L. 
Howse, president of the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation. "Because 
children are not a high enough priority on the national agenda. Babies don't 
vote. Babies don't lobby." 
</P>
<P>
There is little disagreement among experts about what might be done about 
infant mortality in the United States, where some experts believe that up to a 
third of the 40,000 infant deaths a year could be prevented simply by making 
sure that all women got care. 
</P>
<P>
Look to Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia, they say. Countries like Japan 
have cut their infant death rates to as low as half the U.S. rate by 
aggressively promoting maternity and infant care and making it easily and 
widely available. 
</P>
<P>
The first step, experts say, is "universal access" to care for all pregnant 
women and infants. Guaranteeing care to the 500,000 U.S. women without 
maternity coverage who give birth each year could reduce by 15% the rate at 
which babies are born underweight. 
</P>
<P>
Next, experts say agencies must eliminate the obstacles that lower-income women 
face in getting care -- the paperwork, prerequisites, inconvenient hours, 
inconvenient locations, delays and inhospitality that discourage people from 
going in. 
</P>
<P>
But even that is not enough, many say. Health workers must bring in women 
through aggressive outreach, home visiting and public education -- approaches 
that have been proven, when well executed, to help women make use of available 
services and to improve the outcome of pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, studies suggest that infant death would drop 10% if no one smoked 
during pregnancy, and another 10% if all women not wanting to become pregnant 
used contraceptives. Giving pregnant drug addicts priority in drug treatment 
would also help. 
</P>
<P>
But the hardest part to address may be social and psychological. 
</P>
<P>
"If you have women in extremes of poverty, regularly beaten up by their 
boyfriends, with lousy nutrition, prenatal care will help but it's not the 
answer," said Sarah Brown of the Institute of Medicine in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the major phenomena that must be overcome for so many women is the lack 
of self-esteem, the lack of concept of a meaningful future," said Dr. Reed 
Tuckson, a former Washington public health commissioner who is now a March of 
Dimes senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
"If you don't believe you're valuable and important, if your self-esteem is 
low, then you're not going to act in your own self-interest." 
</P>
<P>
Week after week, they go before Ellen Farrior -- newly pregnant, sick to their 
stomachs, abandoned by the father of their child. The task facing Farrior, a 
social worker at Mary's Center, is to begin to repair the fissures left by 
lives in flux. 
</P>
<P>
The initial interview runs about 75 minutes. Farrior pieces together the 
outline of a life -- a woman, barely literate, from a tiny Central American 
village, overwhelmed by the United States; or perhaps an educated woman, in a 
destructive relationship, equally vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not what you say. It's how you listen," Farrior explained recently. "You 
take them seriously. It seems to me that only when what's going on in their 
lives matters to someone other than themselves . . . well, that's the first 
step." 
</P>
<P>
There is a common thread: The women all feel like victims. Farrior sees her 
role as helping them regain control of their lives. She has a pivotal six 
months, perhaps seven, to stand alongside them, support them, help them begin 
to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
Farrior might invite a pregnant teen-ager's parents to come in. Respect your 
daughter's decisions, she might urge the parents. She tries to involve the 
baby's father, figuring it is more difficult to abandon a companion and a child 
when you've gone through a pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
There are other stories of the human component in good maternity care. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent home visit, Carol Koontz and Margaret Haggerty, the center's 
nurses, found a 3-day-old infant with a near-fatal case of jaundice. The mother 
was depressed, the father frightened. The family spoke only Spanish and had no 
car to get to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Koontz and Haggerty drove them immediately to an emergency room. The hospital 
was being renovated and just finding the entrance was a challenge. The nurses 
then served as translators and provided the infant's medical history. The baby 
was treated and lived. 
</P>
<P>
Another pregnant patient turned out to be functionally deaf. A Salvadoran 
immigrant, she had never received help. The center's staff scoured Washington 
for a reduced-rate hearing aid, then raised $326 at a sidewalk bake sale to buy 
it for the woman. 
</P>
<P>
Could such a system be replicated on a broad scale by a city government in 
Washington or other cities? 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Marlene N. Kelley, head of ambulatory health care for the district, is 
pessimistic. Large bureaucracies lack the intimacy and flexibility of small 
clinics, she suggested. And they are tangled in a web of constraints governing 
hiring, firing and budgets. 
</P>
<P>
To enter the city-run clinic at Benning Heights near a pocket of Southeast 
Washington known as Little Beirut (for the gunfire), go past the "Drug Free 
Zone" sign, enter through the steel doors and walk past the armed security 
guard into the waiting room. 
</P>
<P>
A monthly visit might take hours, most of which is spent waiting. According to 
the schedule, patients are allotted 10 to 15 minutes with Dr. Cleveland Emanuel 
Smith, the 66-year-old obstetrician-gynecologist and former Howard University 
professor on staff. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have an ideal situation in the clinic," Smith conceded one morning, a 
small man in a concrete office. "You can't really compare it to private 
practice. But it's better than no prenatal care at all." 
</P>
<P>
On that morning, Patricia Mosby, an unemployed, single mother pregnant with her 
third child, arrived by foot for her monthly visit. She had missed a 7:15 a.m. 
appointment for a sonogram the day before -- unable, she said, to find anyone 
to watch her children. 
</P>
<P>
Mosby, 34, had first called the clinic for prenatal care in her second 
trimester of pregnancy. She had a vaginal infection, she told the clerk. The 
clerk gave her an appointment one month away -- violating the city's two-week 
policy for maternity care. 
</P>
<P>
"The clerks are not medically trained," Smith explained wearily, when asked 
about the incident. "Their minds are not connected to the importance of these 
things. The accountability is kind of . . ." His voice tapered off. 
</P>
<P>
To try to change it, he said, is to fritter away valuable time. 
</P>
<P>
"Here, because of our location and patient population, we've had people (on 
staff) who take an attitude that they can say and do anything to these 
patients," he said. "I think some staff's attitude is, 'Why put out for these 
people?' " 
</P>
<P>
Kelley, the ambulatory health chief, said one big problem is funding. Public 
health staff has been shrinking for years. There are just eight visiting nurses 
for the entire district. Now the department faces a wave of early retirements 
forced by the city's deficit. 
</P>
<P>
Like everything else, the two-week policy hurts other areas, Kelley said. For 
example, it might take two months for an appointment to get birth control. In 
the meantime, the woman could become pregnant -- and be guaranteed a prenatal 
appointment within two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Wanda Harris was living in a shelter when she was first pregnant with Shadawn. 
By the time the baby arrived, Harris had moved into public housing in Little 
Beirut. Shadawn, born at 4 pounds 10 ounces, had health problems requiring 
frequent medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
So on a recent morning, Harris and Shadawn piled into the district's "Mom van." 
Twana Fortune drove them 20 minutes across town to D.C. General Hospital, then 
returned three hours later after a few other trips to drive them back. 
</P>
<P>
What would she do without the van? Harris, who has four children, was asked. 
She sounded bemused. "Miss a lot of appointments, I know that," she said. "It's 
often too cold to wait for the bus. And cabs aren't dependable where I live 
at." 
</P>
<P>
Fortune, 33, who works for the district, understands adversity. She was one of 
11 children raised in a Southeast Washington project. She dropped out of school 
after seventh grade, was pregnant at 15 and had lost two babies by age 18. 
</P>
<P>
But she also understands opportunity. She had the chance to see other ways to 
live -- growing up in the shadow of the Capitol, moving out of the projects at 
age 12, and now living down the street from an upscale neighborhood where 
apartments sell for $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to expose people to different things," said Fortune, who is struck by 
how little some of her passengers know of the city beyond their immediate 
neighborhoods. "If you don't, what choices do they have?" 
</P>
<P>
These days, Fortune maneuvers the maternity van through the toughest and 
grimmest reaches of the city. She bounds through the littered hallways of 
public housing projects, chats with women in glass-strewn parking lots and is 
saddened by what she finds. 
</P>
<P>
"Broken people," is how she put it. "People that I think want to do better, 
that don't know how to do better. People that, I think, are caught in 
circumstances where it might be easier to just lie there than to try to do 
better." 
</P>
<P>
No miracles are being worked by the District of Columbia's programs. The infant 
mortality rate last year was 23.1 deaths per 1,000 live births -- higher than 
that of any state in the country and among the half a dozen U.S. cities with 
the worst rates. 
</P>
<P>
The infant death rate in Washington did drop from 21 deaths per 1,000 live 
births in 1986 to 19.6 deaths in 1987. But, city officials say, the emergence 
of the crack cocaine epidemic reversed that progress: The rate jumped to 23.2 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, crack is just a symptom," said Dr. John H. Niles, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist who heads the D.C. Medical Society. Until poverty 
itself is addressed, he said, attempts to reduce infant death will have only 
limited success. 
</P>
<P>
That is a view shared by former health commissioner Tuckson. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like planting seeds in concrete," Tuckson said. "You have to till the 
soil first." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>

COLD DOES MAJOR DAMAGE TO CROPS; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: HARD HIT ARE CITRUS, LETTUCE, BROCCOLI, AVOCADOS AND ARTICHOKES. 
PRICE INCREASES PREDICTED. 
</P>

<P>
The California cold snap has caused major damage to the state's $8-billion 
fruit and vegetable industry, destroying substantial portions of the citrus 
crop and affecting lettuce, broccoli, avocado and artichoke crops from San 
Diego to Santa Cruz, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
Consumers almost certainly will face sharp price increases at grocery produce 
departments, and growers are exhausted from several nights of trying in vain to 
raise temperatures in their fields by means of wind, fire, water and even a 
spray-on plastic coating. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the most extensive damage I've seen, ever," said Clark Briggs, a 
spokesman for the California Farm Bureau Federation, a private organization 
representing about 45,000 farmers. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County administrative office anticipated millions of dollars in 
agricultural losses. 
</P>
<P>
Several experts predicted that supermarket prices will rise by at least 50% for 
California navel oranges and winter vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
The most devastating damage apparently was in the central portion of the state. 
</P>
<P>
At least one death was attributed to the freeze, a transient who died of 
hypothermia in Anaheim. The 57-year-old man was found in convulsions under a 
recycling center trailer at a grocery store. His name was withheld until 
relatives could be notified, an Orange County coroner's official said. 
</P>
<P>
The chill continued for a third day Sunday throughout the state. The overnight 
temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center, 34 degrees, was one degree warmer 
than the all-time low for Dec. 23. 
</P>
<P>
But record lows for the date were set elsewhere: in Riverside, at 22 and in San 
Diego at 36. 
</P>
<P>
In Bakersfield the low reached 18, with temperatures below 25 for 12 hours. In 
the Bay Area, records were set in San Francisco (a reading of 31) and Oakland 
(26 at the airport). 
</P>
<P>
Shelters for the homeless once more were filled to capacity. 
</P>
<P>
From the San Fernando Valley to San Francisco, water pipes burst and plumbers 
reported running low on insulation and pipe. Santa Cruz County officials 
declared a local state of emergency, with hundreds of residents reporting 
frozen and broken pipes and many going without water. 
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists expect the Arctic air mass that has been hovering over 
California to dissipate over the next two days, with highs in Los Angeles 
reaching the lower 60s today and lows possibly reaching as high as the 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, farmers will take the measure of their losses. 
</P>
<P>
"Citrus is essentially wiped out in the San Joaquin Valley," said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Dan Gudgel, who surveyed growers in the region, 
where about 200,000 acres are planted. He said 70% of the harvest was still on 
trees in Fresno and Tulare counties, with 50% unharvested in Kern County. Wide 
variations were found from orchard to orchard; some growers' crops were nearly 
all picked, others had not begun. 
</P>
<P>
The crystallized fruit has the taste and texture of Popsicles. 
</P>
<P>
One grower in the Fowler-Sanger area, southeast of Fresno, said a navel orange 
he tested "was so frozen I had to put it on the ground" to try to cut through 
it. "I was sawing through it like a baseball." 
</P>
<P>
"Last night was the killer night," said the grower, Richard Berberian, a farmer 
for 27 years. "The navel is gone. The Valencias are gone, the Minneolas are 
gone, the lemons are gone." 
</P>
<P>
In the east end of the valley near the Sierra foothills, grower Tom Mulholland 
said of the area's orange belt: "We're declaring a 100% crop failure." He 
estimated that at least 80% of the area's fruit had frozen in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Nilmeier said he expects to lose his $90,000 investment in this year's 
citrus crop, grown on 400 acres near Fresno. 
</P>
<P>
"My swimming pool . . . is a solid sheet of ice," he said. "If I wanted weather 
like this, I would have moved to the Midwest." 
</P>
<P>
Citrus trees, especially those under 3 years old, also appear damaged, which 
could lead to significant long-term losses. Leaves have faded, curled under and 
blackened at the tip. Growers said the next two weeks will provide evidence of 
life or death. If the bark splits, the tree will not survive. 
</P>
<P>
In the Inland Empire, near Redlands, and in the San Bernardino area, about 20% 
of the citrus crop on about 400 acres was lost to the freeze, said Daniel Elva 
of DJC, a farmers' information network. 
</P>
<P>
Other crops around the state were affected as well. 
</P>
<P>
Joe P. Prandini, general manager of Betteravia Farms Co. near Santa Maria, 
estimates that he has lost about 35% of his cauliflower crop on his 4,000-acre 
farm and said the company has stopped harvesting celery. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the worst I've ever seen," said Prandini, who sent workers home on 
Saturday because the crop was still frozen at noon. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado stems froze in Ventura County, causing the fruit to drop to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
Everywhere, farmers stood all-night vigils in their fields. Some used wind 
machines to try to bring warmer air closer to the ground. Others used water to 
encase their crop in an ice shield. Some used heaters. A few used a newer 
technique of spraying on an invisible polymer that coats leaves with plastic to 
protect the trees. 
</P>
<P>
Some were more successful than others. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, growers said Sunday they had managed to protect the county's 
$168-million nursery and strawberry crops from serious damage. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego County, the frost meant "we'll have some loss, but it won't be 
devastating," said Wilbur Shigehara, an agricultural meteorologist for the 
National Weather Service. "Last night was our only critical night here." 
</P>
<P>
The county has 30,000 acres of citrus, 30,000 acres of avocados and thousands 
of acres of strawberries, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Some citrus growers complained that more fruit would have been harvested 
already if not for a federal marketing policy set by a nine-member navel orange 
administrative committee that meets in Newhall each week to decide how many 
oranges should be picked and shipped. 
</P>
<P>
They blamed five committee members, representing the Sunkist cooperative, who 
have been voting to hold back oranges. 
</P>
<P>
One Sunkist grower said the oranges have been left on the trees because the 
fruit has been low in sugar. The industry was waiting for peak sweetness, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In non-agricultural areas, the main concern was frozen water pipes. In the 
Antelope Valley, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. David Webster, "People 
are calling up 911 and informing us they don't have water. These houses were 
not built to withstand weather below 10 degrees." 
</P>
<P>
"We're basically like an emergency room," said Canyon Country plumber Kurt 
Bohmer, as his telephone rang furiously with calls from frantic customers. 
</P>
<P>
The dispatcher for D&amp;D Rooter and Plumbing in Lancaster said that even her 
employer's home had been without water for two days.

VIETNAM SEEKING RETURN OF AMERICANS AS TOURISTS; 
</P>
<P>
ASIA: BESIDES THE USUAL LURES OF TEMPLES AND CULTURE, OFFICIALS ARE PUSHING 
ANOTHER ATTRACTION -- WAR.

HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Care for a cruise to the underground guerrilla tunnels of Cu Chi, where you can 
fire real AK-47s for a dollar a bullet? 
</P>
<P>
A friendly jaunt to Khe Sanh, site of a ferocious battle that drew the heaviest 
concentration of firepower in the history of U.S. warfare? 
</P>
<P>
How about a 10-day jungle tour down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, complete with war 
games and toy guns that shoot red dye? 
</P>
<P>
Vietnam declared 1990 the "Year of the Tourist," kicking off concentrated 
efforts to develop its tourism industry. Besides the usual tourist lures of 
temples, beaches and ancient cultures, Vietnamese officials are pushing another 
attraction -- war. 
</P>
<P>
Commercializing the bitter conflict that killed 50,000 Americans and injured 
200,000 others strikes some Vietnam veterans as a bizarre exercise in bad 
taste. Particularly since the socialist nation is trying to end its 
international isolation through more liberal trade and foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
"For Vietnam veterans going back now, it's to go back and see the country at 
peace, see villagers working in rice paddies and not be afraid of bombs, to see 
people not antagonistic but welcoming and friendly," said Mary Stout, president 
of the Vietnam Veterans of America. "If the Vietnamese are talking about war 
games on the Ho Chi Minh Trail, that is not something a lot of Vietnam veterans 
would be interested in." 
</P>
<P>
But Vietnamese officials say that numerous veterans have asked for permission 
to return to battle sites that have remained off-limits to foreigners. Why not 
open the sites up, let the catharsis begin -- and make a dollar in the process? 
</P>
<P>
"When I was in the States, many people said they would like to go from north to 
south by the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The American vets would like to see again where 
they were during the war," said Nguyen Khac Thin, public relations officer of 
the state-owned Saigon Tourist. "Once the U.S. embargo is lifted, we think many 
more of these people would like to come to Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese officials are also promoting more conventional attractions, but the 
country lacks many of the basics for developing tourism. Air flights are still 
limited. Transportation within Vietnam is difficult. For example, the 109-mile 
trip from Hanoi to Halong Bay, a cove filled with stone caves and 3,000 tiny 
islands, takes four hours by car over bumpy roads. 
</P>
<P>
To reach central Vietnam's Da Lat -- the "City of Love" with waterfalls, 
rolling hills and lakes -- visitors can wait for the twice-weekly flights from 
Ho Chi Minh City or brave a five-hour jarring car ride. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel rooms are a problem as well. There is only one five-star hotel in 
Vietnam, the Saigon Floating Hotel, and officials project that another 2,000 to 
3,000 hotel rooms are needed to accommodate demand. Several foreign companies 
are putting up new hotels. But making Vietnam the paradise of Indochina is 
still years away. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, war mementos are becoming Vietnam's biggest tourist 
attraction. Take Cu Chi, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
Anti-French fighters first began digging the underground tunnel complex in the 
1940s to hide weapons. During the Vietnam War, Viet Cong guerrillas vastly 
expanded the network to 200 miles and used it to to evade American bombs and 
travel undetected under patrolled roads. 
</P>
<P>
The tunnels were a state secret until 1986. Today, Cu Chi is proudly promoted 
by government tourists officials as "the highlight of Ho Chi Minh City." 
Officials say 500 people a day visit during peak tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
On a recent day, Nguyen To Manh, a former Vietnamese army captain in dark 
glasses and close-cropped hair, lectured 14 foreign tourists about the tunnel 
system. Then the visitors from Thailand, China, France, the Philippines and the 
United States scampered into the jungle. They stomped around, looking for the 
secret entrance. 
</P>
<P>
They descended into the tunnels, dimly lit and widened for Western physiques. 
Past the hollowed-out rooms for the commander in chief, the political committee 
and the kitchen, a tour guide pointed out a trapdoor that dropped enemies to 
their death on iron spikes below. 
</P>
<P>
"Now it's so solid, you can dance on it," the grinning guide said, hopping up 
and down on the door. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, the tourists donned military caps bearing the gold star of Hanoi, 
grabbed AK-47 rifles and took turns hamming it up. Smile! Cameras clicked 
furiously. 
</P>
<P>
The journey from Ho Chi Minh City -- formerly Saigon -- to Cu Chi takes about 
90 minutes each way in vans, which sometimes leak gasoline and gave a recent 
French tourist nausea. To make the journey more comfortable, Saigon Tourist 
recently spent $20,000 paving over a bumpy red dirt road to better protect 
delicate foreign bottoms. The agency is planning boat rides to the tunnels down 
the Saigon River. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are also learning about marketing. A year ago, Cu Chi's refreshment 
stand consisted of an old U.S Army jerrycan filled with cold drinks. Today, 
officials have put up a thatched hut offering Heineken beer and Coca-Cola. A 
souvenir stand sells hammocks, U.S. military oil lamps and T-shirts emblazoned 
with smiling and armed Viet Cong women: "I've been to the Cu Chi tunnels." 
</P>
<P>
The latest attraction was built six months ago: a firing range where tourists 
can shoot real Russian AK-47s and American M-16s for a dollar a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
Why on earth would they want to? 
</P>
<P>
"To get some shocking feelings," said Nguyen Tri Dung, a tour guide with Saigon 
Tourist. The range pulls in about $50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
But not all of the Cu Chi tour is grim war memories. A new open-air restaurant 
offering local specialties such as cang chua dau ca, or sour fish soup, opened 
a year ago next to the Saigon River. The billboard beckons tourists to enjoy 
the "Fresh Air, Natural, Romantic Atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
Beyond Cu Chi, tour officials are planning to open tours to former 
battlefields, such as Khe Sanh. But the piece de resistance is the Ho Chi Minh 
Trail trip. The famous route, which snakes through thick jungle in the 
mountainous terrain of eastern Laos, was used by the North Vietnamese to 
infiltrate the south. Dung said the idea is to let tourists make part of the 
trip by van and part by foot, with nightly camps set up in the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
For entertainment, officials are hoping to offer war games, with tourists 
dividing into two camps and competing to control a military base. 
</P>
<P>
"You could be like real soldiers," Dung said. "You could wear real military 
uniforms and use real weapons, but not with real bullets." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Burns, a San Jose lawyer and Vietnam veteran who has returned 15 times in 
the last three years, jokingly suggested to Vietnamese authorities that they 
should offer helicopter rides from the top of the former U.S. Embassy, billing 
the attraction as the "Last Flight Out." So far, no one has taken him up on the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
Burns, who specializes in refugee cases, said he gets five to 10 calls a week 
from veterans asking him how to arrange trips to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
"There are veterans who absolutely hate Vietnam and never want to see it again, 
but I think there are still veterans who are attracted to the country because 
of what they did and saw in their youth," Burns said. 
</P>
<P>
Stout also said many veterans find it cathartic to return to places they fought 
in -- one person even returned to where he was shot. But reviving the memory of 
violence through firing ranges or war games is in bad taste, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Other Americans who did not serve in the war also find the idea offensive. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps as a woman and American, I'm not interested in reliving horrible 
places like that," said Nina Hale, a Washington lawyer who traveled to Vietnam 
for the first time in October. 
</P>
<P>
Hale said she was particularly put off by the War Museum, which is a standard 
stop on the Ho Chi Minh City tour. The museum features old tanks and aircraft, 
a gallery of nightmarish photos chronicling American "atrocities" and displays 
on how Agent Orange and other chemicals deformed the land and people. 
</P>
<P>
"To have your nose rubbed in the fact that your country trashed the place . . . 
it was too harsh a reminder and takes away from the perspective all tourists 
have, which is an escape from unpleasantness," said Hale, 35, who specializes 
in refugee affairs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was also too one-sided. There was no concession to the fact that a lot of 
Americans suffered and died there too." 
</P>
<P>
Hale said the Vietnamese should use the war as a lesson. For instance, the 
Japanese built a peace memorial at Hiroshima to convey the horrors of nuclear 
war to all humankind. She also said the country should more strongly promote 
its beaches, culture and ethnic minorities, such as the Cham. 
</P>
<P>
"See a Cham village, so Americans can rid themselves of the image of Viet Cong 
in cone hats and black pajamas who are out to get our boys," Hale said. 
</P>
<P>
"The best part of visiting Vietnam as an American is to actually see the 
people, to humanize something that is an unfortunate part of our history." 
</P>
<P>
That is also the advice offered by Patrick Imbardelli, the Australian general 
manager of the Saigon Floating Hotel, the first foreign-owned hotel in Vietnam. 
Imbardelli is working with the Vietnamese and the United Nations Development 
Program to draw up a master plan to promote tourism. The plan is expected to be 
released next year. 
</P>
<P>
"People want to see pagodas, temples. But for the Vietnamese, the attractions 
are the War Museum and Cu Chi. Do you really think hundreds of Japanese from a 
war-stricken place like Japan want to queue up outside the atrocities museum?" 
Imbardelli asked. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not, but Saigon Tourist officials also have a plan for the Japanese: 
offering tours to the Japanese warships that are believed to have been sunk by 
Americans during World War II in Vietnamese coastal waters. Tour guide Dung 
said he recently arranged a special three-day trip to a small island for a 
group of former Japanese sailors. They offered sake, fruit and food to the 
spirits of their dead comrades. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Vietnamese officials say they are well aware that they must promote 
their country as something other than a symbol of war. The numbers tell the 
story. Since Vietnam opened its doors to the world in 1987, foreign visitors 
have more than quintupled, from 41,000 in 1986 to 250,000 in 1990, according to 
the Vietnam National Administration for Tourism. During that same period, 
tourist revenues have grown from $46 million to $68 million. 
</P>
<P>
But those numbers are dwarfed by other Southeast Asian competitors. Malaysia, 
for instance, drew 4 million tourists and $839 million in revenues during its 
"Year of the Tourist" in 1989. Even the Philippines -- which has been plagued 
by frequent coup attempts, flooding, earthquakes and a moribund economy -- drew 
1.2 million tourists and $1.2 billion in receipts in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
What the Philippines has that Vietnam lacks is a more alluring image, 
Imbardelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't base tourism on the war thing. Base it on the mystique of the Orient," 
Imbardelli said, warming up to one of his favorite topics. "The culture of the 
past, the handicrafts, the combination of two cultures in the north and south. 
The Mekong Delta, the old magic of Hue city built on the Perfume River. The 
beautiful sand, palm trees, tropical feel. My God, think of it!"

CANCER AND POWER LINES -- AN UNCERTAIN CONNECTION; 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH: A 1979 STUDY LINKED MAGNETIC FIELDS WITH CHILDHOOD DISEASE. BUT THE 
ISSUE IS FAR FROM SETTLED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When a 1979 study indicated that childhood cancer rates were higher in families 
living near high-current electric power lines, scornful utility officials and 
many scientists insisted that electromagnetic fields from power lines couldn't 
possibly affect human health. 
</P>
<P>
But a follow-up study supported the findings, concluding that children living 
near high-current lines were 1.5 to 2 times more likely than others to get 
cancer. Other studies have found that workers in electrical jobs -- such as 
utility linemen, power station operators and electricians -- have higher rates 
for brain cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, the same cancers implicated in the 
childhood studies. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the issue is far from settled. There are ambiguities in much of the 
research, and other studies have found no link between illness and electric and 
magnetic (EM) fields. Nor does anyone know the mechanism by which these fields, 
even weak ones, may cause harm. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is especially perplexing because few things seem more benign or 
indispensable than electricity, and it is hard for some scientists to envision 
demons lurking in electric wires. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Adair, a Yale University physics professor and leading doubter, said 
investigating the effects of EM fields is like looking for "werewolves. . . . 
When someone tells you a leaf fell on an elephant and broke his back, you're 
skeptical," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, a growing number of lawmakers and even utility executives are 
calling for more research on potential health effects and ways to reduce 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
And what began as concern about power lines now includes electric blankets and 
video display terminals, which also expose users to EM fields. Amid the 
uncertainties, some experts are advocating "prudent avoidance," or limiting 
exposure to fields in cheap and simple ways. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is creating concern in communities throughout the country, where the 
mere suggestion of power line hazards may devalue property. Parents fret over 
schools that were built in the shadow of transmission towers to take advantage 
of cheap land. And neighbors are battling new transmission lines and electrical 
distributing stations, like the one the Los Angeles Department of Water and 
Power wants to build in Arleta. 
</P>
<P>
In a draft report released earlier this month, the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency described fields "from power lines and perhaps other sources 
in the home as a possible, but not proven, cause of cancer in humans." 
</P>
<P>
The EPA and other federal health agencies have been criticized for investing 
too little in EM health research, much of which is funded by utilities. Citing 
austerity budgets and other priorities, the EPA dropped its own research 
program a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is pathetic, said Dr. David O. Carpenter, dean of the School of 
Public Health at the State University of New York at Albany. "I think . . . 
there really are some hazards here," but "the federal government has simply not 
been a player of any major import." 
</P>
<P>
Other experts say that the risk, if there is one, seems small compared to 
hazards like cigarettes, alcohol and asbestos. 
</P>
<P>
Childhood cancer, for example, is mercifully rare, striking about one child in 
10,000 per year. If, as some studies suggest, the risk doubles for children 
living near high-current lines, the risk climbs to two chances in 10,000. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such slim odds, however, EM fields could emerge as one of society's 
more significant involuntary risks. Carpenter, former head of a New York state 
program of EM fields research, has estimated that fields could account for 20% 
to 30% of childhood cancers, or up to 2,000 per year, as well as 4,000 adult 
cancers annually in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The stakes are really high on this," Ken Henderson, director of compliance for 
the California Public Utilities Commission, recently told a meeting of utility 
officials. "If damages are proved," he said, "society increasingly demands that 
someone pay," and utilities are seen as having the "deepest pockets around." 
</P>
<P>
Utilities do not look forward to the prospect of retrofitting the nation's 
electric power grid -- which some say would reduce the problem -- at a cost in 
the billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I think in hindsight, we should have come in with more research money sooner," 
said Jack Sahl, senior research scientist with Southern California Edison. But 
"it's not like the health departments . . . were saying that we ought to be 
really pushing this hard." 
</P>
<P>
The press also paid less attention to this than to other cancer scares. "A lot 
of this information isn't that new," but "the institutions in society that 
would normally warn you about this haven't," said Louis Slesin, editor of the 
Microwave News, a newsletter that provided steady coverage of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Humans have always been exposed to electromagnetic energy, from the Earth's 
static magnetic field to the fields produced by bursts of lightning. Brain, 
muscle and nerve tissues produce electric currents as part of their normal 
function. 
</P>
<P>
But fields created by the electric power grid, and the gadgets it runs, have 
altered the electromagnetic environment. 
</P>
<P>
Every wire or appliance that carries electric current produces electric and 
magnetic fields -- invisible lines of force that radiate outward and fall off 
sharply with distance from their source. 
</P>
<P>
Fields associated with electrical power are called 60 cycle, or 60 Hertz, 
fields because they are produced by alternating current that flows back and 
forth, reversing direction 60 times per second. 
</P>
<P>
These extremely low-frequency fields are at the far end of an electromagnetic 
spectrum. Toward the other end are radar and microwaves, which oscillate at 
frequencies in the billions of cycles per second. 
</P>
<P>
Higher still on the frequency spectrum are ultraviolet, X-rays, and gamma rays 
-- called ionizing radiation because their high-energy waves actually tear 
apart -- or ionize -- atoms of living cells, damaging genetic material and 
creating a risk of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, it was believed that EM radiation could affect living cells in 
only two ways: either by ionization or heating tissue, as microwaves do. Since 
fields induced in the body by power lines and appliances are weaker than fields 
produced by the body itself, they were thought to have no biological effect. 
</P>
<P>
However, by the 1970s some scientists had demonstrated changes in the function 
of cells exposed to low-frequency fields. And from Eastern Europe came reports 
of stress and sexual dysfunction among workers at electric power switchyards. 
</P>
<P>
But the watershed was the 1979 study indicating a higher rate of childhood 
cancer in homes near high-current power lines. The Denver-based study was done 
by Nancy Wertheimer and Ed Leeper, a pair of obscure researchers working with 
their own funds. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a joke between us for quite a long time," said Wertheimer, adding that 
she and Leeper spent "two years before we published trying to make the findings 
go away, because we thought it was an accident somehow." Nine years later, a 
second Denver study, led by epidemiologist David Savitz, found childhood cancer 
rates were 1.5 to 2 times above average for children living near high-current 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, EM fields were implicated in various occupational studies. For 
example, a 1982 USC study found that white males in Los Angeles County with 
electrical occupations had leukemia rates 29% above average. 
</P>
<P>
The same year, a study found that leukemia mortality in Washington state from 
1950 through 1979 was 37% higher than average among workers in electrical 
occupations. 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 study found that utility workers in east Texas were 13 times more likely 
to develop brain tumors than other workers. A 1989 study in Los Angeles County 
found rates of astrocytoma, a type of brain cancer, were 4.3 times greater for 
men with over five years in electrical work, and 10 times greater for those 
with more than 10 years of experience. 
</P>
<P>
Another study has found elevated cancer rates in the children of workers in 
electrical occupations, suggesting that fields may affect the sperm. 
</P>
<P>
Many appliances generate strong EM fields, but in most cases the use is 
sporadic and field strengths drop sharply with distance. 
</P>
<P>
But electric blankets can expose users to high fields for hours at a time. A 
study published last May found higher cancer rates among children whose mothers 
used electric blankets during pregnancy. An earlier study linked electric 
blanket use during pregnancy to higher risk of miscarriage. 
</P>
<P>
Two more studies found no link between electric blanket use and leukemia and 
testicular cancer, respectively. Another study found no connection between EM 
fields and an acute form of leukemia. 
</P>
<P>
The ubiquitous video display terminal has also stirred concern, because it 
exposes users to fields that are weak, yet of similar strength to those 
implicated in the childhood cancer studies. A 1988 study found higher rates of 
miscarriage and birth defects among Northern California women who used computer 
terminals more than 20 hours per week during their first trimester of 
pregnancy. Other studies concluded that VDTs are probably safe to use during 
pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
In the laboratory, scientists have shown that EM fields alter basic cellular 
functions, like protein synthesis and production of hormones involved in immune 
response. Some have theorized that fields create weak currents around cell 
membranes that alter biochemical signals, possibly interfering with the 
cancer-fighting function of the immune system. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a body of laboratory evidence, there is a body of epidemiological 
evidence, and the two are coming together in a very remarkable way," said Dr. 
W. Ross Adey, associate chief of staff at the Pettis Memorial Veterans 
Administration Medical Center in Loma Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Others say that overstates the case. They point to contradictory studies that 
found no elevated cancer risk with EM fields, as well as flaws in studies that 
suggested a link. For example, most of these studies included few, if any, 
measurements to show that workers and children living near power lines actually 
had higher exposure. 
</P>
<P>
The Savitz findings in Denver illustrate some of the difficulties in 
interpreting the research. His childhood cancer data not only indicated a link 
with power lines, but with maternal smoking, failure of mothers to breast feed, 
and higher auto traffic near the home. 
</P>
<P>
If there is a hazard, reducing it will be a daunting task. In general, exposure 
from power lines can be lessened by raising tower heights and expanding rights 
of way, or by "phasing" lines -- arraying them in such a way that fields cancel 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
However, field strengths may also depend on wiring and the way the power is 
grounded in the home. And it's uncertain what aspects of fields should be 
controlled -- whether the risk would be in magnetic or electric fields or both, 
and results from chronic exposure to weak fields or transient peaks in field 
strengths. 
</P>
<P>
Consequently, utility officials and electronics manufacturers contend that 
regulations are premature. "I understand we are all under tremendous pressure 
from our customers and our clients to do something, even if it's wrong," said 
Kirby C. Holte, a consulting scientist with Southern California Edison. "We 
simply don't know what to regulate, and whatever we do, we will probably be 
wrong given all the opportunities to be wrong." 
</P>
<P>
Currently three states are sponsoring EM fields research, including a 
three-year, $2-million program in California. No results have been reported as 
yet from that study, which began in 1989. And the Electric Power Research 
Institute, a utility industry group based in Palo Alto, is spending $6 million 
on EM fields research, more than all federal agencies combined. 
</P>
<P>
Utilities have won praise for their effort, but many officials are uneasy about 
the fact that they dominate the research. 
</P>
<P>
"I would not want to rely upon research funded by the Electric Power Research 
Institute for the definitive word on the health effects of electromagnetic 
radiation," said Rep. George Brown (D-Colton). "It's just too obvious a 
conflict of interest." 
</P>
<P>
Congress next year is expected to consider bills to increase federal funding 
and put a centralized research program under authority of a single federal 
agency or interagency committee. 
</P>
<P>
The Large Public Power Council, representing the Los Angeles DWP and other 
publicly owned utilities, also is calling for a federally controlled research 
fund to which utilities would contribute. "Let's pool this money and utilize a 
federal agency to oversee a national study," said Bernard V. Palk, the DWP's 
assistant chief engineer for power. 
</P>
<P>
"There is an urgency to get out ahead of this thing and make sure the research 
is done," said Dr. Raymond Neutra, chief of special epidemiological studies for 
the California Department of Health Services.

<P>
Slovenians voted overwhelmingly Sunday for their republic to secede from 
Yugoslavia. In Serbia, the renamed Communists appeared headed for defeat in 
runoff elections, the opposition said. 
</P>
<P>
According to unofficial results of Slovenia's plebiscite, 88% of the electorate 
voted for secession, 4% voted against and the remainder of the ballots were 
invalid. 
</P>
<P>
Thousands danced and cheered in the streets of the Slovenian capital of 
Ljubljana. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next six months, Slovenia will decide whether to stay in Yugoslavia 
or become an independent country," Slovenian President Milan Kucan said. 
</P>
<P>
Center-right parties in Croatia and Slovenia ousted Communists in spring 
elections. Both republics have threatened to secede if Yugoslavia does not 
transform itself into a loose confederation of semi-independent states. 
</P>
<P>
The largest republic, Serbia, advocates a strong federal government. The 
opposition celebrated what it said were victories in Serbia's largest cities, 
including Belgrade, in runoff voting for the 250-seat legislature. 
</P>
<P>
In the first round, Serbia's Socialists -- formerly the Communists -- scored a 
resounding victory by winning 87 seats. Ethnic Hungarian and Muslim groups won 
nine constituencies. The three major opposition parties got none. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, many opposition candidates were reportedly in the lead for the 
remaining 154 seats.

overwhelmingly backed secession from the nation, early results indicated. The 
vote came despite federal threats of armed intervention. Demands for Slovenian 
independence have been growing since April, when the republic voted to end 45 
years of Communist rule. A breakaway would set a precedent for other 
independence-minded regions, perhaps leading to the disintegration of the 
nation. Associated Press

POLITICAL BRIEFING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN and RON BROWNSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WAR AND PEACE: As Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) and other congressional leaders call 
for more restraint in the Persian Gulf crisis, some Democrats worry the stance 
may revive charges that the party lacks the backbone to stand up to America's 
foes. New York Rep. Stephen J. Solarz, a hard-liner on the gulf, privately 
warns party leaders that if Democrats appear to be obstructionist and President 
Bush wins a quick military victory, the party could be shut out of the White 
House for the rest of the century. 
</P>
<P>
But those arguing for more caution remain unfazed. Ted Van Dyk, one-time 
adviser to former Sen. George S. McGovern (D-S.D.), contends that arguing for 
giving the trade embargo more time to work before taking military action 
against Iraq is "both the politically safe and correct policy position." 
</P>
<P>
BLACK POWER: President Bush's hopes of making inroads among blacks in the 1992 
presidential campaign suffered a serious setback from an Education Department 
proposal to ban scholarships specifically aimed at minority students. 
</P>
<P>
Even before that, Bush's popularity among blacks appeared to be slipping -- the 
result of the weakening in the economy, the growing threat of war in the Middle 
East and the Administration's vocal opposition to the congressional civil 
rights bill. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest Los Angeles Times Poll, taken from Dec. 8 through Dec. 12 -- the 
day the short-lived Education Department policy was announced -- blacks 
disapproved of Bush's handling of the presidency by a margin of 61% to 35%. 
That essentially reversed the President's showing of a year earlier, when 
blacks approved of his performance by a margin of 60% to 28%. 
</P>
<P>
GOP DILEMMA: When President Bush selects someone to replace former 
Administration drug czar William J. Bennett as chairman-designate of the 
Republican Party, the nominee will face formidable challenges in preparing the 
beleaguered party organization for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
At the top of the list is money. Although donations from direct mail 
solicitations have been running close to expectations, party strategists say 
gifts from large contributors have fallen off. With the economy in a slump, 
many Republicans are openly dubious that the RNC will be able to match the 
$89.5 million it raised for the 1988 election. 
</P>
<P>
Also looming are intraparty disputes over taxes and domestic policy and fights 
between top White House aides and Republican congressional leaders. 
</P>
<P>
Still to be decided is how much control will remain with the RNC, and how much 
will be assumed by the Bush reelection apparatus, probably under pollster 
Robert M. Teeter. 
</P>
<P>
EMPOWERMENT?: The Bush Administration's new "empowerment" theme is getting a 
skeptical reception from the nation's GOP governors. 
</P>
<P>
The state chief executives like the theory behind the new theme, which calls 
for decentralizing decision-making power to help them deal with local problems. 
But they complain they are being hamstrung by increasing restrictions on 
federal social programs, which require them to spend their resources on 
programs that Washington favors or risk losing federal financial aid. 
</P>
<P>

level consuming resources on a program that they've decided on, that 
disempowers the states." ROBERT SHOGAN and RON BROWNSTEIN

<TEXT>
<P>
There is a sign pointing the way to John Hudson's 40-acre farm, but it's 
hand-painted and nailed cockeyed to a pole and partially hidden by tall weeds 
on a two-lane road so far back into Everglades country that you have to look 
for it. The sign reads "Airboat Rides and Gators -- Straight Ahead." 
</P>
<P>
We're not talking Disney World here. We're talking a piece of high ground in 
the swamp, littered with derelict trucks and rusted camper bodies, and 
populated by more than 4,000 of the most fearsome and fascinating creatures on 
Earth. But on an average day, some 150 people, many from Europe, find their way 
out here to take a look. 
</P>
<P>
One recent morning Hudson broke away from a group of German tourists and leaned 
over a low cinder-block wall to look into pens where several hundred young two 
and three-foot-long alligators lay in the sunshine. With snaggletoothed 
overbites and a slight upturn to their jawline, the animals seemed to be 
smiling in warm contentment. 
</P>
<P>
"Yep," said Hudson, a bearded 68-year-old with a resonant baritone that once 
served him well as a Southern Baptist preacher, "gators have been good to me." 
</P>
<P>
At the sound of Hudson's voice, the gators stampeded to the far end of the 
enclosure and scrambled into a wriggling pile. "They recognize my voice and 
they associate it with trouble," Hudson said with a laugh. "They think I might 
be coming in to get them." 
</P>
<P>
That day the gators had nothing to fear. In fact, the next time Hudson lassos 
one of his alligators it might be to load it up for a truck ride to 
Mississippi, where South Florida's only gator farmer intends to set up a larger 
commercial operation. There, he said, he will produce 25,000 pounds of gator 
meat a year by 1992. What Hudson has in mind is gator burgers, gator nuggets 
and barbecue gator, available in supermarkets everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
"Who eats gator meat?" he asks. "Anybody who's ever tried it. Low fat, low 
cholesterol and high in protein." 
</P>
<P>
In preparation for that day, Hudson's ramshackle, low-tech tourist attraction 
is for sale. The asking price is $1.5 million. For that the buyer will get a 
house, a big tin-roof shed, six airboats, several junked vehicles and 2,000 
linear feet of live alligator, in whatever configuration desired. 
</P>
<P>
"You could have 200 10-footers, 1,000 two-footers or any combination you want," 
Hudson said. "But I suggest the buyer take at least a couple of the 15-footers 
out in the ponds there, because those are the ones people like to see." 
</P>
<P>
Hudson claims his tourist business takes in an average of $1,000 a day. 
Admission to the farm is $1, airboat rides through the saw grass are $7.50, and 
when someone is there to open the snack bar, it's $3 for a gator burger on a 
bun. 
</P>
<P>
"A real entrepreneur could quadruple business here overnight," said Hudson, 
whose small staff is composed of recovering alcoholics referred by a rescue 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson is a junior high school dropout, former casino owner and one-time 
hellfire preacher from Alabama who bought an airboat ride business here, some 
25 miles south of Miami, 13 years ago. In 1985, when the federal government 
removed alligators from the endangered species list, Hudson was one of the 
first in Florida to obtain a permit to raise them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
As the price of gator meat and hide climbed (hide now sells for about $75 a 
foot), Hudson spotted the potential in other locations. This year he became the 
first of seven commercial operators to be licensed in Mississippi, according to 
biologist Jim Lipe of the state's Department of Wildlife, Fisheries and Parks. 
</P>
<P>
Hudson said he is packing up most of his gators and moving to the Gulf Coast 
town of Pascagoula, Miss., to be near his four children and 11 grandchildren 
and because in the colder winters, the reptiles will hibernate for up to four 
months, slashing his feed costs. 
</P>
<P>
He thinks gator meat could become as popular in the South as catfish. Lipe, for 
one, doubts that. But Lipe has eaten gator meat, and describes it as "healthful 
and very good. I like it fried," he said.

Hudson is bullish on gators, and not simply because of the economics of meat 
and leather. "There is a worldwide fascination with the reptile that dates to 
prehistoric times, and I think God gave this animal a special assignment," he 
explained. "During times of drought, gator holes provide the only water to save 
many other species. 
</P>
<P>
"In Mississippi, we're going to use the proceeds of our operation to further 
our work with recovering alcoholics. So truly the alligator is an animal of 
salvation."

make their way each day to a remote South Florida farm, just to see some of 
John Hudson's 4,000 writhing alligators, right. But, American Album reports, 
the low-tech tourist attraction is up for sale -- Hudson has grander plans. He 
hopes to set up a commercial operation in Mississippi to produce thousands of 
pounds of gator meat a year. Said Hudson: "Who eats gator meat? Anybody who's 
ever tried it. Low fat, low cholesterol and high in protein." SUSAN GREENWOOD /

Crew members of the U.S. aircraft carrier Saratoga bid farewell to their 21 
drowned comrades in a memorial service. About 1,200 attended the shipboard 
ceremony for those who died when their ferry capsized Saturday en route to the 
Saratoga from shore leave in Haifa, Israel.

Twenty bodies have been recovered; the 21st was still being sought.

Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said that a number of nations in the 28-member 
force arrayed against Iraq would not fight to drive Iraq from Kuwait. He 
declined to name the countries, but he pointedly refused to include France and 
Syria among the stalwart supporters of U.S. policy.

Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Arab leaders in the Persian Gulf met to iron out differences over how tough a 
line to take with Baghdad. Some of the six Gulf Cooperation Council leaders 
said peace should be given more time before implementing the U.N. resolution 
authorizing use of force after Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti leaders reportedly refused to talk with Iraq until it has withdrawn 
from Kuwait, but some other nations wanted to discuss giving Iraq use of two 
Kuwaiti islands.

Domestic Front: 
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader George J. Mitchell predicted that Congress would deny 
President Bush "blank-check authorization" to attack Iraq after Jan. 15. 
Mitchell said Congress must consider the ramifications of using force, saying, 
for example, that if Iraq countered U.S. force by attacking Israel, Syria would 
likely switch sides to join Iraq.

TRUCK SPILLS ACID ON TEXAS FREEWAY

<TEXT>
<P>
Decontamination crews worked for eight hours Sunday to clean up 10,000 gallons 
of acid that spilled after a tanker truck skidded on icy Interstate 10 in 
Baytown. 
</P>
<P>
Department of Public Safety spokesman David Wells said the eastbound tanker was 
carrying 40,000 gallons of hydrochloric acid solution from Freeport to 
Beaumont. 
</P>
<P>
Driver Leon Tremonte of Freeport told officers the truck hit ice on the roadway 
at about 6 a.m. and skidded into a guardrail. The tanker struck the guardrail 
and ruptured before bouncing into a ditch and spilling about a fourth of its 
load. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said police blocked off the area and a hazardous materials squad was 
rushed in to clean up the spilled acid. 
</P>
<P>
Tremonte suffered only minor injuries and was treated for breathing problems 
after exposure to the caustic material. 
</P>
<P>
Wells said the spilled acid was loaded onto other vehicles and the wreckage was 
cleared by 2 p.m., enabling troopers to reopen the busy freeway between Houston 
and Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
No other injuries were reported.

TEMPERATURE RECORDS SHATTER IN COLD WAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Temperatures dropped as low as 39 degrees below zero Sunday as the arctic cold 
wave refrigerated the western two-thirds of the nation and edged toward the 
East with freezing rain and ice that sent cars and trucks sliding. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, record highs in the 60s and 70s extended from New England to 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
Flooding forced the evacuation of hundreds of people in parts of Kentucky, 
Tennessee and Alabama, where nearly a foot of rain had fallen. 
</P>
<P>
At least 60 deaths have been blamed on the weather since the cold began 
Tuesday. Most were traffic fatalities, but some died of hypothermia or from 
fires blamed on overworked heaters or fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit was Texas with 19 deaths, 16 in traffic accidents. Many bridges and 
roadways across the state were covered by ice up to an inch thick Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Ice also spread eastward with the advance of the cold. A combination of snow, 
sleet and freezing rain fell on Indiana late Saturday night and Sunday morning. 
An ice storm moved into western Kentucky. Freezing rain also swept across 
Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
The coldest spot in the Lower 48 states was in northwestern Colorado, at Craig, 
where Sunday's low was 39 degrees below zero, the National Weather Service 
said. Denver hit a record 16 below. 
</P>
<P>
Wyoming's cold spot was Jackson with a reading of 35 below at midmorning and a 
wind chill of 60 below. Cheyenne was above zero, at 5 degrees, but the wind 
chill was 39 below. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona, the magnet for thousands of "snow birds" who annually flee colder 
Northern states, did not have one reporting station with a low above freezing 
Sunday. Phoenix hit a record 26 degrees, and Tucson dropped to a record 21. 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque dropped to 7 degrees below zero Sunday, the first time on record 
the city has gone below zero in December. 
</P>
<P>
The city that bills itself the "Icebox of the Nation," International Falls, 
Minn., took Sunday's low of 29 below in stride. "It's business as usual -- you 
have no choice up here," restaurant owner Chris Mostad said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The cold air was pressing against a belt of unseasonably warm air along the 
East Coast and was expected to overrun the Northeast today. 
</P>
<P>
Record highs included 64 at Harrisburg, Pa.; 67 at Newark, N.J.; 65 at Boston; 
58 at Burlington, Vt.; 69 at Baltimore; 72 at Atlanta, and 73 at Richmond, Va. 
</P>
<P>
At Topsail Island, N.C., "People are walking around here with shorts and 
T-shirts on," said Kevin Hollis. 
</P>
<P>
"It just doesn't seem like Christmas with this weather," said Tom Chroniger, 
hitting baseballs with a friend at Burtonsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
Citrus growers in southern Texas checked their crops for frost damage from 
below-freezing temperatures, but there was no immediate word on crop loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been here in '83 (during a severe freeze) and it's not freezing like that 
at all," said Burt Purvis, who works on a citrus farm near McAllen. 
</P>
<P>
Too much water, not ice, caused flooding from southern Indiana across Kentucky 
and Tennessee into Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
In northern Alabama, flooding from nearly a foot of rain from Friday night into 
Sunday chased dozens of residents from their homes Sunday, and rescue workers 
scurried to aid motorists stranded on submerged roads. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't turn the faucet off," said Fred Keeney, a planner with the Morgan 
County Emergency Management Agency in Alabama. "We don't really know how many 
evacuations. . . . We've got a lot of people who have been moved." 
</P>
<P>
Flooding in southeastern Tennessee forced more than 450 people from their 
homes, and 600 people were isolated with roads under water and some bridges 
washed out, authorities said. The Tennessee Valley Authority was releasing 
water from all of its dams after up to five inches of rain fell in the region 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of people were evacuated in southeastern Kentucky as streams rose after 
days of saturating rain.

SMALL TOWN'S SALUTE IS BITTERSWEET AS ITS SOLDIERS MARCH OFF TO THE GULF; 
</P>
<P>
DEFENSE: THE CALL-UP OF NATIONAL GUARDSMEN PLUCKED 61 MEN FROM THE WORK FORCE 
IN SPRINGFIELD, KY. BUT THE EMOTIONAL STRAIN IS FELT THE MOST.

SPRINGFIELD, Ky. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Everyone here will long remember Dec. 10, the day the 623rd Battalion -- the 
first unit of the Kentucky National Guard to be called up for deployment to the 
Persian Gulf -- left home. 
</P>
<P>
"They said it was a military secret but the word traveled word-of-mouth, and we 
had hundreds of people lining the streets carrying yellow ribbons and waving 
flags," Ninie Glasscock, managing editor of the Springfield Sun, recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But while the send-off lifted Springfield's pride and spirit, it also has left 
a gaping hole in this tiny farming and industrial community of 2,900. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment to the gulf plucked 61 men from the Springfield area's work 
force, some of them students and recent graduates and others who farmed or 
worked in local factories or stores. Many local residents are doubling up on 
their workloads until the field artillery unit returns. 
</P>
<P>
But it is the emotional strain that is felt most here as Springfield waits -- 
anxiously -- for the confrontation with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to come 
to a head. 
</P>
<P>
Melinda Carey, a loan officer, says the impact -- particularly at Christmastime 
-- has been traumatic. "In a big city, it doesn't mean as much when boys go 
off," Carey says, "but this could decimate a small community like ours. In 
these places, everyone knows everyone. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just eight years old when a boy in (neighboring) Bardstown was killed in 
Vietnam and I remember what I was doing, what I was wearing -- everything," 
Carey recalls. "Everyone has large families, and everyone is related." 
</P>
<P>
Dan Kelly, a local state senator, who was born here but is still considered a 
newcomer because he moved away for a few years, agrees. "The Christmas spirit 
definitely got killed by Saddam Hussein," he says. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, partly because of the impact of the call-up, the town has been unable 
to exult in its good economic fortune. 
</P>
<P>
Although many small towns are beginning to feel the current slowdown, 
Springfield is on something of a roll. Its fledgling industries are expanding 
and on the day the troops left for the gulf a Japanese company announced that 
it would build a new plant in the county. 
</P>
<P>
It was "a happy day and a sad day," Springfield Mayor John W. Cecconi recalls. 
</P>
<P>
But the call-up of the 623rd has left many families in uncomfortable straits 
and resulted in some cases of serious hardship. One woman here was laid off 
from her job a week after her husband left for the gulf. Another gave birth to 
a baby an hour after the troops left town. 
</P>
<P>
Predictably, perhaps, for a small town, Springfield residents have been pulling 
together to support each other during the travail. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two weeks, the area's 11 support groups have collected more than 
$600 in donations for families in financial jeopardy because of the deployment. 
Local merchants have agreed to grant them extended credit. 
</P>
<P>
The town's umbrella Gulf Support Group plans to send packages of food and 
clothing to all men of the 623rd every month, and -- by request from the front 
-- local school officials are gearing up to send the troops videotapes of the 
town's high school basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
To top that off, Charlie Walls, a local musician, has written a song, "Ten 
Thousand Miles Away," recounting the send-off that the 623rd received three 
weeks ago. "We get the most requests for that and Eddie Rabbit's 'American 
Boy,' " says disc jockey Andy Carter. 
</P>
<P>
For all the sadness, Cecconi says that most Springfield residents still 
strongly support the U.S. troops, even if they don't necessarily agree with 
President Bush's overall policy in the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"He may be wrong in some peoples' eyes, but I don't think he's wrong in the 
people's eyes around here," says Cecconi, a Democrat in a heavily democratic 
and predominantly Catholic town. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be the last person to run down the commander-in-chief of the United 
States, whether he's Democrat or Republican," Cecconi asserts. 
</P>
<P>
To many of Springfield's older residents, who themselves were veterans of 
previous call-ups, the pullout earlier this month brought memories, good and 
bad. 
</P>
<P>
James R. Clements, an octogenarian, recalls waving goodby to Springfield's 
123rd Cavalry as it loaded up at the city's train station in the winter of 
1917. Twenty-three years later, he himself was called up as part of the same 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
And Bill Waters, an electronics store owner who was called for service in Korea 
on Dec. 23, 1950, says he felt pride and a little envy as he watched his 
neighbors leaving for the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
"But it was different back then," Waters acknowledges. "We trained just up the 
street on Armory Hill every day and then marched into town, ate dinner at the 
restaurant and went home. People would watch us and get out of our way. I was 
just 19 and I loved all that attention." 
</P>
<P>
Waters said that there was much he would have liked to have said to the troops 
this time, but nothing came out. "I just took my hat off, your heart kind of 
swells," he says.

CHARGERS' TAYLOR MAKES RETURN TO NFL IN STYLE

A few weeks ago, he was filling up his days helping out with a high school 
track program and exercising at the health spa. 
</P>
<P>
Kitrick Taylor, released by the Patriots in the exhibition season, didn't 
figure he'd be playing football again this season. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd say about the ninth or 10th game I was really counting it out, basically 
looking forward to next year," he said. "Then the Chargers called and worked me 
out and they like what they see." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, 11 days after Taylor signed with the Chargers, he took a Kansas City 
punt 55 yards for a touchdown and gave his teammates cause to cheer. On the 
play, he darted through two tacklers coming at him straight on, cut left and 
raced to the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
That tied the game at 21. 
</P>
<P>
"It was pretty much a turnaround because we were down," Taylor said. "You work 
hard at special teams and you always believe that special teams is what can 
make a difference in the game." DON PATTERSON

Van Halen Sues 2 Live Crew Over Copyright: Heavy metal rock band Van Halen sued 
members of the rap group 2 Live Crew, contending that they illegally used part 
of the Van Halen hit "Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love" on a popular rap tune. In the 
federal suit, Van Halen Music Inc. said 2 Live Crew member David Hobbs admitted 
in a deposition last May that two of his group's tunes duplicated music in the 
Van Halen song. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asserts that 2 Live Crew has sold at least 2 million copies of the 
song in singles and on the albums "As Nasty as They Wanna Be" and "As Clean as 
They Wanna Be." In addition to damages for copyright infringement, the suit 
seeks $300,000 in damages for unfair competition. (Case No. 90- 6834. Filed 
Dec. 20, 1990).

PERFORMER BUILDS CAREER ON SONGS OF GERSHWIN, PORTER, BERLIN

<P>
When Michael Feinstein was playing small nightclubs in his native Columbus, 
Ohio, nobody predicted the musical success that was awaiting him. 
</P>
<P>
He began and ended his formal piano training at 5, when his piano teacher 
realized that he was not learning to read music, but was playing everything by 
ear. And, as for the music he liked to play, well, popular standards from the 
1920s to the 1950s hardly seemed a way to reach one's contemporaries in the 
1970s to 1980s -- or so he was told. 
</P>
<P>
Never mind. 
</P>
<P>
Neither the way he plays nor the old songs he sings has stopped the 
34-year-old's meteoric rise to stardom. 
</P>
<P>
As recently as 1984 he was just a cabaret performer. Since then he's recorded 
seven records, played three Broadway engagements, and performed in London for 
Great Britain's Royal Family as well as at the White House for President Reagan 
and his wife, Nancy. 
</P>
<P>
He brings his 1990 Broadway-originated concert, "Piano and Voice," to the San 
Diego Civic Theatre, Wednesday through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
Although Feinstein played for a sold-out benefit performance at the Old Globe 
Theatre last year, this show, produced by the San Diego Playgoers Series, marks 
Feinstein's first public performances in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
And, as usual, he will be playing what he likes: George and Ira Gershwin, 
Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Jerome Kern, Richard Rodgers, and Lorenz Hart. And, 
he promises, you can count on hearing "Isn't It Romantic?" and "I Love A 
Piano." 
</P>
<P>
"I had been playing piano off and on for years, but I didn't seriously consider 
that that would be a profession," said Feinstein at the Westgate Hotel where he 
had come for a day of interviews. 
</P>
<P>
His career got started, indirectly, when he gained and lost a job as Ira 
Gershwin's literary executor. 
</P>
<P>
The job had been a dream come true for Feinstein, who in 1976, the same year he 
met Gershwin, had taken on a job as a piano salesman in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
For six years after he met the lyricist, Feinstein devoted his time to 
cataloguing Gershwin's collection of phonograph records, sheet music, 
unpublished manuscripts, scores and lyrics, and to finding out just how 
Gershwin wanted his songs to be performed. 
</P>
<P>
"Being with the creator of these works was not only exhilarating, but a 
valuable experience I couldn't get from any other source. I learned what Ira 
liked, how he liked his songs sung, what he liked pointed up in the lyrics. I 
soaked up as much as I could that he was willing to share." 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein said that he would have happily devoted the rest of his life to 
protecting Gershwin's literary estate, but a falling out with Gershwin's widow 
(for reasons Feinstein declines to disclose) after Gershwin's death in 1983 
ended that job, and Feinstein found himself playing nightclubs again. 
</P>
<P>
"It was very depressing because I felt I'd let Ira down," Feinstein recalls 
softly. The rift eventually healed, but not before Feinstein found himself, to 
his surprise, with another career on his hands. 
</P>
<P>
He took a job at some small clubs and later at Le Mondrian Hotel in West 
Hollywood, and he found celebrities like George Burns, Elizabeth Taylor, Jean 
Stapleton and Dear Abby flocking to hear him. 
</P>
<P>
Part of that was due to the influence of another famous friend, Liza Minnelli, 
who got things going by giving him a star-studded party at Le Mondrian. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein met Minnelli at a party, but the connection clicked, in part, because 
of Gershwin. Ira Gershwin was Liza Minnelli's godfather and had been the best 
man at the wedding of her parents, Vincente Minnelli and Judy Garland. 
</P>
<P>
But Feinstein's greatest asset remains his knowledge of the Gershwin material. 
For, as critics have commented over the years, it isn't Feinstein's voice or 
even piano playing that make him so special. It is his style, his understanding 
and his infectious love for the music he plays that sets him apart. 
</P>
<P>
A date at the York Hotel in San Francisco, and his first record, "Pure 
Gershwin," in 1985, was followed by an engagement at the Algonquin Hotel's Oak 
Room and a second album, "Live at the Algonquin" in 1986. Then came a flurry of 
television appearances, engagements at the Hollywood Bowl and on Broadway, and 
Feinstein soon found his career was on fire. 
</P>
<P>
Now Feinstein has committed himself to preserving and reviving the work of 
other pop composers. He is planning to record an album of songs by Hugh Martin, 
the Encinitas-based composer who wrote "Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas" 
and the score for the original and revived "Meet Me in St. Louis" with Ralph 
Blane. "Meet Me in St. Louis" will come to the San Diego Civic Theatre next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein just produced an album of Burton Lane songs. And he is now working on 
an album of unpublished Gershwin songs. The songs are good, Feinstein says. But 
he doesn't expect them to have the same impact as the old songs. 
</P>
<P>
"No matter how good any of these songs might be, because they're heard for the 
first time, you don't have the advantage of 50 years of memories. 
</P>
<P>
"Music is a way of accessing one's memory banks. It triggers memories. The 
newer Gerswhin songs will also be considered distant cousins." 
</P>
<P>
For Feinstein some of those memories involve sitting with his parents and 
watching "The Lawrence Welk Show" as a child. "A very important tradition," he 
says with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
And while he said he would never have believed 10 years ago that he would be 
making a living performing the work that he adores, in retrospect he is not all 
that surprised that these songs are here to stay. 
</P>
<P>
"The romance is important in those songs and romance is important today. People 
are crying out for romance."

THORN IN THEIR SIDES: STATIONS AT ODDS OVER PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
TELEVISION: KTLA SAYS KTTV'S 'COMMERCIAL-FREE BROADCAST' CLAIM IS BUNK. KTTV 
INSISTS THAT ITS 'INFORMAL' MENTIONS OF SPONSORS DO NOT CONSTITUTE A 
COMMERCIAL. 
</P>

<P>
The Tournament of Roses Parade has provoked a stink between two local TV 
stations that will broadcast the event live on New Year's Day. What smells, 
according to KTLA Channel 5, is KTTV Channel 11's claim that it will air the 
annual pageant "without any commercials whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
KTTV's parade broadcast will be sponsored by several major corporations that 
will pay to be mentioned and thanked at the beginning and end of the 2 1/2-hour 
program, said Don Tillman, KTTV's vice president of programming. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute is one of semantics over what will happen every half hour in 
between. Tillman conceded that four times during the course of the parade, the 
Channel 11 hosts will explain that viewers are seeing the parade without 
commercial interruptions because of the cooperation of the sponsors -- who will 
be named. 
</P>
<P>
"It will be very informal," he said. "They might say, 'And if you are enjoying 
the telecast, you might want to drop them a note.' " 
</P>
<P>
Tillman said that there will be no visual identification of the sponsors 
superimposed on the screen over the parade scene, as the station has done in 
the past. KTLA also uses that approach, superimposing the logos of its sponsors 
over the picture while the hosts read a brief ad. 
</P>
<P>
Tillman insisted that KTTV's "informal" mentions of the sponsors do not 
constitute a commercial. 
</P>
<P>
Channel 5 thinks otherwise. "It's very deceptive and misleading," said Ed 
Harrison, KTLA's spokesman. "These sponsors are still paying for that mention. 
It is an advertisement. True, it may not be a traditional commercial that we 
are all used to seeing. It's not a hard sell, but it is a paid corporate 
endorsement. If they say there's going to be absolutely no commercials, then 
they should be fair about it and not have any commercials. This is just another 
one of their gimmicks." 
</P>
<P>
Tillman, whose station broadcast the parade in 3-D two years ago, would not say 
how much the sponsors are paying to be a part of KTTV's coverage. But when 
asked if the station would lose any money, he replied: "I certainly hope not. 
That's not what I'm here for. 
</P>
<P>
"The sad part about this whole thing," Tillman added, "is that this is 
something that is a real sincere gesture to our viewers and a real good-faith 
effort on the part of our sponsors, and our competitor is trying to make it 
look like something that is evil and ugly." 
</P>
<P>
KTLA is also miffed about one of KTTV's promos for its so-called 
"commercial-free" broadcast that purports to show what the parade telecast 
looks like on other stations. A sign emblazoned with a big fish advertising 
"Fishman's Fish Market" is then flashed on the screen, blocking the view of the 
parade in the background. Hal Fishman, of course, is KTLA's news anchor. 
</P>
<P>
"It's pretty funny," said KTLA's Harrison. "But it is a cheap shot, and even 
worse, it's inaccurate. We don't block any part of the parade. The visual logos 
are shown very discreetly on the bottom third of the screen. They don't 
interrupt anything." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Parade will also be telecast live beginning at 8 a.m. on Channels 2, 4 
and 7 and on Spanish-language station KMEX Channel 34. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, KTLA clobbered KTTV and all other stations in parade ratings, 
grabbing about 1.1 million households in the Los Angeles area and 46% of all 
those watching television at the time. That was more than the combined audience 
of KTTV and the other four local stations broadcasting the parade.

MUSICAL: THREE GUYS FROM L.A. HAVE CREATED 'A CAROL OF CHRISTMAS' IN A CITY 
WHERE HARD TIMES ARE THREATENING THE YULE SPIRIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force base is closing here, and jobs are growing scarce. Property 
prices have fallen; banks are uneasy. A tank of gas for the car now costs what 
a good blouse or sweater used to. It's getting very cold, and heating the 
house, to the horror of people in this seaside community, has become a luxury. 
</P>
<P>
Could this be the time for "A Carol of Christmas"? 
</P>
<P>
"Humbug!" shouted Abner Stone, the updated answer to Dickens' Scrooge. "Utter 
nonsense!" 
</P>
<P>
Stone, portrayed by an actor named William Morris, enunciated each syllable 
with fiendish precision. His expression screamed scoundrel. His gestures 
shouted villain. 
</P>
<P>
Leaning against the piano, lyricist Bruce Belland crowed "Perfect! I love it!" 
Composer Roy M. Rogosin offered a satisfied grin. Joel Rogosin, who wrote the 
book for "A Carol of Christmas," nodded approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
It was right, Belland and the Rogosins were saying. With beards and gentle 
middle-aged paunches that made them look like shopping-mall Santas on their day 
off, the three displaced Angelenos had captured the bitter crux of Christmas 
1990, when hard economic times are threatening generosity of spirit. They had 
catapulted Dickens into a new century and set their tale to music while they 
were at it. 
</P>
<P>
"We decided to take the familiar legend and place it in a town like 
Portsmouth," which has been so negatively affected by the economy, Roy Rogosin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I understand that it's not just here." Times are tough in so many places, 
said Rogosin, "and I thought we could create a Christmas show which had the 
values of the familiar 'Christmas Carol' " in a contemporary setting. 
</P>
<P>
There is a character named Tim, Roy Rogosin explained. "He doesn't have a 
crutch, but he observes his parents' marriage falling apart." Abner Stone, the 
factory owner, is threatening to shut down the town's major employer, a marine 
propeller plant. For 20th-Century authenticity, there is an extraterrestrial 
named Barnaby. 
</P>
<P>
Roy M. Rogosin, 49, is a veteran musical director. For many years he worked 
with Johnny Mathis, and for four years he worked in Paris with Michel Legrand. 
He spent 20 years conducting and writing music for Broadway as well as for 
movies and television. His wife and business partner, Eileen, is an 
ex-Mouseketeer. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, Rogosin went to Portsmouth to direct "The Music Man" at the town's 
Music Hall. When he went home to L.A., things neither looked nor felt the same. 
A year later, the Rogosins packed up their two kids, sold the home they had 
owned for 20 years and resettled in Portsmouth.

"We had friends in L.A. who said, 'New Hampshire, that's near New York, right?' 
" Rogosin said. "They'd say things like: 'How far are you from the grocery 
store?' 'Are there schools there?' " 
</P>
<P>
Roy and Eileen Rogosin founded PAPA, the Portsmouth Academy of Performing Arts. 
When theater space in a 19th-Century brewery became available two years ago, 
the Rogosins became the proprietors of the Bow Street Theater here. Their 
performing group is known as the Seacoast Repertory Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, Bruce Belland had been making "obscene" amounts 
of money producing game shows. He worked for Ralph Edwards, and said he was 
widely viewed as a successor to Edwards when the older man retired. But 
Belland, the lead singer for the Four Preps, a middle-of-the-road 1960s pop 
group, was never quite happy. "I missed the music," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
Now 54, Belland was a star in the choir at Hollywood High. He was also a 
lyricist, turning out such Four Preps hits as "26 Miles (Across the Sea)," "I 
Was a Big Man Yesterday" and "Down by the Station." The group disbanded in 
1969, and, for a time, Belland became a regular actor on "The Adventures of 
Ozzie and Harriet." 
</P>
<P>
By 1980, Belland was producing five shows for TV. He was also writing lyrics 
for Willie Nelson and writing songs that became hits in Europe. One Belland 
composition, "What Would I Do Without My Music?," seemed to have a prophetic 
title. 
</P>
<P>
That year, Roy Rogosin called Belland with a proposal for a musical. The two 
had become friends some years earlier when both toured with Johnny Mathis. Now 
Rogosin was telling about a book he had read, "Minding the Store," about the 
founding family of the Neiman Marcus stores. 
</P>
<P>
To the consternation of his Hollywood colleagues, "I just walked away from my 
TV job," Belland said. "I realize it was foolish and unrealistic, but I don't 
regret it." 
</P>
<P>
While struggling with "Minding the Store," Belland and Rogosin wrote another 
musical, "Quick Change." It opened and closed on Broadway in four days. 
</P>
<P>
Rogosin and Belland kept their friendship, but went their separate professional 
ways. In 1988, with encouragement from Dick Clark, the new Four Preps were 
launched as "Three Golden Groups in One" -- two Preps (Belland and Ed Cobb; a 
Diamond (David Somerville) and a Letterman (Jim Pike). 
</P>
<P>
The group rehearsed for 11 months before setting out on a major concert tour. 
Belland, for one, was pleased with the product. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no humble way for me to say it," he said. "It's the best vocal group 
God put together." 
</P>
<P>
Belland said he has been having "an absolute ball" with the reorganized Four 
Preps. He paused for only a moment last spring when his friend Roy Rogosin 
called and asked if he would write the lyrics for an original Christmas 
musical. 
</P>
<P>
His brother Joel, 58, a television producer in L.A., had written "an 
extraordinary" play, Rogosin told Belland. They wanted something fresh. "I 
didn't want to do Kentucky Fried Christmas," Roy Rogosin said. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the lyrics -- such as the words to the haunting song "Folks Around 
Here" -- were written while the Four Preps were on tour. Appearing at the Trump 
Castle in Atlantic City, Belland would rush up to his room after the show, 
change into sweats, then write until the wee hours. His faxes would come to the 
Rogosins at 4 and 5 a.m. in Portsmouth. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to imagine trying to write Currier &amp; Ives lyrics in a place like 
Atlantic City," Belland said. 
</P>
<P>
The Rogosin brothers and Belland have found it "refreshing" to work together, 
Joel Rogosin said. 
</P>
<P>
"In L.A., they have all these committees. Here, we're the committee, the three 
of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"A Carol of Christmas" runs at the Bow Street Theater in Portsmouth through 
Dec. 23. This spring, the three will reunite when the Seacoast Rep offers the 
show they still believe in -- even if Broadway didn't -- "Minding the Store."

CROWD PLEASING SOUL BAND HAS A LOT OF HEART; 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC: IN A SHOW AT THE BELLY UP, JACK MACK AND THE HEART ATTACK AGAIN 
DEMONSTRATE WHY THEY ARE A TOP DRAW IN SOUTHLAND NIGHTCLUBS.

<P>
It started out as a fun band, a group of Los Angeles songwriters and musicians 
who wanted to let loose and play the style of music they had all been weaned 
on: the good-time Memphis soul of the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
And today, 10 years later, Jack Mack and the Heart Attack is still a fun band, 
a band you'd want to have play your party, a band that can shake, rattle and 
roll with the best of 'em. 
</P>
<P>
That was evident from their Friday night concert at the Belly Up Tavern in 
Solana Beach, where they've been appearing periodically for the last five or so 
years. 
</P>
<P>
It was essentially the diner scene from the movie, "The Blues Brothers," played 
over and over again -- a whimsical retrospective of the glorious Stax-Volt era 
rather than a serious documentary. Jack Mack and the Heart Attack aren't out to 
resurrect the past, just remember it. And remember it they did, paying homage 
to the likes of Wilson Pickett, Otis Redding, and James Brown by building up 
from the foundation instead of merely rummaging through the ruins. To be sure, 
they played a few covers, including faithful renditions of Pickett's "Funky 
Broadway" and Brown's "Cold Sweat." But there were many more originals written 
in the same style and delivered with the same sense of passion and urgency. If 
these guys are reviving anything, it's the sass and the style rather than the 
actual tunes. 
</P>
<P>
The band opened with the infectious "It's A Beautiful Thing," off their latest 
album, "Jack It Up." It's a monster of a song, rife with majestic horn 
punctuations and celebratory organ swirls. Then came a few older songs, 
including such crowd pleasers as "Wonderful Girl" and "True Lovin' Woman" that 
have helped make Jack Mack and the Heart Attack a consistent top draw on the 
Southern California nightclub circuit. 
</P>
<P>
Particularly compelling was the group's interpretation of Procol Harum's 
classic "A Whiter Shade of Pale," also off their new album. By slowing down the 
tempo and heating up the passion, they effectively transformed a cool rock song 
into a sweltering soul masterpiece, much like Joe Cocker's brilliant reading of 
the Animals' "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood." 
</P>
<P>
Singer Mark Campbell may look like a cross between Roy Clark and Sam Kinison, 
but he's got a deliciously throaty voice that sounds remarkably like that of 
the late Sam Cooke. And the four-member Heart Attack Horns, led by tenor 
saxophonist Billy Bergman, are a bundle of energy and intensity. They make the 
much-ballyhooed Tower of Power horn section seem almost wimpy by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
From the first song until the final encore, the dance floor was a throbbing, 
sweating mass of bodies. Even after the encore, it took awhile for the crowd to 
disperse, as though no one wanted to accept the fact that the concert was, 
indeed, over. 
</P>
<P>
Opening the show was a local rock band, Jerry McCann and the Band of Giants, 
who sadly failed to live up to their name. McCann is an excellent guitarist who 
rendered some remarkably fluid, bluesy lead work, but that's about the only 
good thing that can be said about their performance. 
</P>
<P>
Their rhythm section was weak, their material was mediocre, and too often they 
fell into gimmicky arrangements -- from pseudo- reggae to pseudo-country -- 
that made the whole thing sound even worse.

HAPPY AS A CLAN;

<P>
RODRIGUEZ FAMILY IS BIG ON ITS REUNION TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HECTOR TOBAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The reporter and photographer from the old Los Angeles Examiner arrived at the 
Rodriguez home just after Esther gave birth to her 15th child. The cameraman 
lined up the Rodriguez offspring -- 3-year-old Elizabeth at one end, 
21-year-old Albert Jr. at the other -- and tripped the shutter. 
</P>
<P>
The year was 1948. Alberto Rodriguez Sr. and his flock of children were 
fighting poverty. When the picture appeared in the Examiner the next morning, 
the caption reported that the Rodriguez clan ate meals in four shifts. 
</P>
<P>
Forty-two years later, the Rodriguez family was reunited once again over the 
weekend at their annual Christmas party. It was a family reunion like few 
others. Fourteen of the 15 Rodriguez siblings were there along with nearly 200 
grandchildren, great-grandchildren and in-laws. 
</P>
<P>
The story of the brothers and sisters reads like an epic novel about Southern 
California's Latino community. It spans three wars -- one Rodriguez son served 
in World War II, two more in Korea, and a fourth was wounded by a sniper's 
bullet in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
More than any other event, the annual Christmas party has kept the family 
united through five decades of success and adversity. 
</P>
<P>
Ernestine Garcia, now 59 and the oldest of the Rodriguez daughters, remembers 
the words of advice her mother shared with her just before she died in 1986 at 
age 80. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother would tell us, 'Always stick together,' " Ernestine recalls. " 
'Teach your kids to stick together on that special day. Tell them that once you 
break (the tradition), it never comes back.' " 
</P>
<P>
The lives of the siblings have crisscrossed with most of the major events of 
recent Mexican-American history -- including the 1943 zoot suit riots in Los 
Angeles and the great migrations of bracero workers in the 1940s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
The 1948 photo captured a rare moment when all 15 children lived together under 
one roof in a small house in Elysian Valley near downtown. A few months after 
the youngest child, Richard, was born, the older children began having families 
of their own. 
</P>
<P>
The party long ago outgrew any single family home. This year it was held at the 
Friendship Hall in Silver Lake, with the tamales and taquitos catered from a 
nearby Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
As in years past, Tony, 60, and the second-oldest of the Rodriguez children, 
was Santa Claus. Seated in a tall chair, "Santa" passed out presents to each of 
his 100 nephews, nieces, grandchildren, great-nieces and great-nephews. Then 
there were more presents for all of his siblings and in-laws. In all, it took 
more than an hour. 
</P>
<P>
The older Rodriguez children -- those who lived through the Great Depression -- 
remember other Christmas celebrations, when there weren't as many gifts and as 
much food to go around. 
</P>
<P>
California was gripped in poverty and unemployment. The situation was so 
critical that Los Angeles Police Chief James (Two Gun) Davis sent officers to 
staff barricades at the California-Arizona state line, trying to keep out the 
armies of Midwestern migrants descending on the city in search of jobs. It was 
hard for everyone -- even more so for Alberto Rodriguez, a humble laborer from 
central Mexico who had a new baby to feed nearly every year. 
</P>
<P>
"Times were tough then, like we're going through today," said Albert Jr., 63. 
"Sometimes, I remember, we didn't have enough to buy shoes. Today we see the 
people at the churches picking up (free government) cheese. It reminds me of 
that time. There's a lot of people really going through hardships again." 
</P>
<P>
During the most poverty-stricken Christmases, the family accepted boxes of 
gifts from Roman Catholic charities. The girls contented themselves with a 
doll, the boys with a ball or some other simple toy. The brothers and sisters 
agree: Material things just didn't seem as important then. 
</P>
<P>
"That was a really poor time," Albert recalled. "But it was a good time." 
</P>
<P>
The best Christmas present was just being able to live together under one roof. 
By the 1940s, the family had grown so large that Alberto and Esther couldn't 
afford a home large enough for all the children. For a time, the older sons and 
daughters lived in a motel while the younger children lived in a series of 
garages and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, in 1947, the family found an affordable, two-bedroom clapboard house 
in Elysian Valley. Somehow, they were able to fit a dozen beds into the home's 
five rooms. 
</P>
<P>
"At night it was wall-to-wall mattresses on the floor," recalled Margaret, 58. 
"Whoever got home first got a bed." 
</P>
<P>
Elysian Valley -- called "Frogtown" because the little amphibians blanketed the 
streets when the nearby Los Angeles River flooded -- was a community of 
railroad workers and their families. 
</P>
<P>
Alberto packed ice into boxcars for the Pacfic Fruit Express, supervising a 
team of braceros, Mexican workers contracted to fill the jobs of GIs. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Alberto was hard-working. He had come to the United States as 
a young adult and held jobs as a butcher, day laborer and steel-foundry worker. 
He met his wife, a native of Mazatlan, while both were studying English at 
Jefferson High School in the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
Esther is remembered by her children for her sense of humor -- it helped her 
keep things under control as 15 children scurried about the house. She enlisted 
her older daughters in the nearly round-the-clock task of cooking meals, making 
dozens of tortillas and burritos, some of which Alberto sold to the braceros 
for a little extra money. 
</P>
<P>
When they weren't helping with the chores, the older girls earned 50 cents an 
hour at a laundry. Eventually, they all dropped out of school to work full 
time. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always worked," said Ernestine, who still works at a laundry. "I started 
my first job when I was 9 or 10 and could pass for 15. Kids today have 
everything laid out for them on a platter. Back then, we were satisfied with 
anything they gave us." 
</P>
<P>
Tony joined his father working at the rail yard. And like many Mexican-American 
teen-agers of the 1940s, he was swept away by the zoot suit craze. He proudly 
sported the oversized pants, dovetail haircut and long watch-chain of the 
pachuco. 
</P>
<P>
"In those days, it was the style," he said, somewhat defensively. 
</P>
<P>
Although Tony was not involved in the 1943 zoot suit riots, he and his brothers 
remember the street-fighting between Anglo servicemen and Latino youths. 
</P>
<P>
"It was terrible," Albert Jr. recalled. "The soldiers attacked the streetcars 
and cut (the pachucos') pants with knives." 
</P>
<P>
At home, meanwhile, the babies kept coming. Esther was a heavy-set woman and 
even her teen-age daughters couldn't tell when she was pregnant. Margaret said 
they had a clue that a baby was coming only when her mother began scrubbing the 
floor of her bedroom with disinfectant -- most of the children were born at 
home with the help of a midwife. 
</P>
<P>
When she went into labor, Esther sent her children to the movies for the 
evening "as a treat." 
</P>
<P>
Upon returning home, they would be greeted by the cries of a new baby brother 
or sister. 
</P>
<P>
"Each baby was like it was the first one," Margaret said, recalling her 
father's reaction to a birth. "He was so excited and so happy. I remember when 
Richard (the 15th child) was born -- you would think that was his first son." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks after Richard was born, the Examiner crew arrived. Even then, in the 
days before birth control and family planning, 15 was a lot of kids. The 
Rodriguez family portrait would make a nice feature photograph in the next 
day's paper. 
</P>
<P>
As the older Rodriguez children remember it, the cameraman was in a hurry: He 
had a deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Tony and Albert had just arrived home from work and were rushed into the shot. 
Margaret scrambled to look for her little brother Joe's shoes, until the 
photographer barked out: "That's all right, that's all right! Come on!" 
</P>
<P>
And so 4-year-old Joe, who was to become a Vietnam vet, posed in his bare feet. 
</P>
<P>
By 10 p.m. Saturday, with all the gift-giving over, the Friendship Hall looked 
like any family's living room on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Discarded wrapping paper piled up around the Christmas tree, while the 
grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Esther and Alberto Rodriguez tossed 
new footballs and rolled toy cars on the linoleum floor. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Wiemann, son of Mary Wiemann (the seventh of the Rodriguez children), 
waxed nostalgic as he watched his three children thank Santa Claus. Wiemann, 
35, said he too had sat on the lap of the same "Santa" without realizing it was 
really his Uncle Tony. 
</P>
<P>
"We used to wait and wait because we didn't open (the presents) until after 
midnight," Wiemann said. "We sat in the living room and he'd pass out each 
gift, one at a time." 
</P>
<P>
The Christmas parties were then held at the family home in Glendale -- the 
Rodriguezes moved there just before the Glendale Freeway came through Elysian 
Valley, obliterating their old clapboard house. 
</P>
<P>
The younger children -- Raymond, Carmen, Joe, Elizabeth and Richard -- grew up 
in an English-speaking world different from the Spanish-speaking world of their 
parents and older siblings. 
</P>
<P>
Margaret recalls that her father once remarked: "The first five kids speak 
Spanish. The second five speak a little Spanish. And the last five, I don't 
know what they speak." 
</P>
<P>
Alberto, who had never failed to provide for his sons and daughters when they 
were small children, found life difficult as he became older. With the advent 
of refrigerated boxcars, he lost his job at the railroad icehouse. 
</P>
<P>
"Times were changing real fast," Margaret remembered. "Under all the stress, 
everything just kind of caved in. He wasn't able to get work like before. He 
began to drink. It was downhill for him." 
</P>
<P>
Alberto died in 1967 in a car accident on Riverside Drive, only a few blocks 
from the site of his former Elysian Valley home. It was only one of a series of 
tragedies to befall the family -- Albert's youngest son, Damon, 18, died just 
after Christmas in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
Albert recalls the weeks before his son's death, from complications related to 
Down's syndrome: "It was December, he would get up in the morning and would ask 
his mother, 'Mama, is today, Christmas?' "He was just looking forward to that 
party," Albert continued. "Well, Christmas came by and he went to the party. 
Early in January he died. 
</P>
<P>
"But that was his driving force, to go to the Christmas party."

IN BRIEF: SYNDROME'S EXISTENCE DOUBTED

A new study has raised new questions about the existence of a mysterious 
syndrome that some doctors have linked to repeated yeast infections, 
researchers said last week. In the study, the widely used anti-fungal drug 
nystatin was no more effective than a dummy drug in relieving symptoms such as 
fatigue, premenstrual tension, gastrointestinal problems and depression in 42 
women with a history of vaginal yeast infections. 
</P>
<P>
"I think these data cast further doubt on the existence of the syndrome," which 
is variously known as chronic candiasis, candida-related complex and candiasis 
hypersensitivity syndrome, said Dr. William Dismukes of the University of 
Alabama Medical Center in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
Yeast infections are caused by the fungus Candida albicans, which is commonly 
found in the intestinal tract and the vagina. Usually, it does not create 
problems. But if factors such as use of antibiotics or pregnancy allow the 
fungus to grow rapidly, it can cause vaginal infections in women. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers believe that chronic candiasis not only causes vaginal 
irritation and discharge but a host of other symptoms as well. However, in the 
study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dismukes and 
co-researchers concluded that their results "provide additional objective 
evidence that the syndrome is not a verifiable condition."

IN BRIEF: DRUG, BLOOD CANCER RISK LINKED

<P>
Treatment of heart transplant patients with a powerful immune suppressing drug 
appears to sharply increase their risk of a lethal form of blood cell cancer, a 
study concludes. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers found that 11% of patients at one hospital who were treated this 
way quickly developed lymphoma, and most of those people died. 
</P>
<P>
The treatment is called OKT3, an antibody that attacks a variety of white blood 
cells that play a key role in making the body reject the transplanted organ. 
The new study shows that even if OKT3 prevents rejection -- and this is in 
doubt -- the benefit comes at a high price of cancer risk.

football. His teams won 76% of their games. His student-athletes graduated. 
NCAA investigators weren't the least bit interested in his recruiting tactics. 
</P>
<P>
Some powerful people in the town didn't like him, though. They wanted friendly 
conversation and their backs slapped, but he was more into pounding on his 
players' pads and screaming, "%&amp;, you're better than that." And one 
influential group who contributed lots of money to the school was very unhappy 
when he moved his television show from their channel to another. 
</P>
<P>
So he was fired. 
</P>
<P>
Earle Bruce was deeply wounded when Ohio State President Edward H. Jennings 
fired him in the fall of 1987, the week before the final game of his ninth 
season as the Buckeyes' head football coach, a game Bruce won, 23-20, over 
rival Michigan. This was no run-of-the-mill coaching change. It was like 
cutting a first child out of the will. 
</P>
<P>
The bond may have been severed that day, but Bruce will always be part Buckeye. 
He's proud to be a "card-carrying, lifetime member of the alumni association." 
He still calls the Ohio State job "the epitome of coaching." Not long ago, he 
thought it was the only job he ever wanted. 
</P>
<P>
And he doesn't know what schmooze means. 
</P>
<P>
"Loyalty is blind," Bruce said. "I thought I could just win and they'd never be 
able to get me. They proved me wrong." 
</P>
<P>
So he ached. He watched his family mourn, and their tears made him angry. And, 
sure, he was bitter for a while. In time, however, he began to look at it as 
just another bell-ringer of a tackle. And he had been knocked down plenty of 
times before. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce had played football, taught football, loved and lived football all of his 
life. Getting knocked down is part of the game, he had always told his players, 
and the most important part of the game is getting back up. 
</P>
<P>
So he shook off the effects of the blow and got back in the game. 
</P>
<P>
"If you always live in the past, you're never going to be happy," Bruce said. 
"I can't live in the past. I can't be bitter. I've got to be better." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PRESENT 
</P>
<P>
Before the first game of the season, Colorado State Coach Earle Bruce asked his 
players to list their goals for the year. No. 1 on the list was a bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
True, the Rams had recovered from a two-year record of 2-21 to go 5-5-1 last 
season, Bruce's first in Ft. Collins, but considering they hadn't been in a 
bowl game in 42 years, Bruce figured this was a pretty lofty goal. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't want to do anything to stop wishful thinking," he said at a 
preseason press conference. "You need dreams. Every once in a while, I dream 
about hitting the lottery." 
</P>
<P>
But, just like that, bingo, the Rams rang up the right numbers -- 8-4 -- to be 
winners in the NCAA's version of the big spin. 
</P>
<P>
So, as the Colorado State players chugged up the ramp leading from the field at 
Orange Coast College's LeBard Stadium -- where they were preparing for their 
Saturday night date with Oregon in the Freedom Bowl -- Bruce plopped down on 
the back of an equipment cart and smiled sheepishly. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players, 'I don't mind you putting that down, but realize we're 
reaching awful high,' " he said. "I mean I thought it was a great goal, but I 
didn't really think it was attainable. I like to put goals down that we can 
reach. To go to a bowl that quick. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce clearly is no pessimist, but a trip to a bowl game was, well, as one 
life-long Colorado State fan put it, "just plain unthinkable." Ram fans never 
have visions of Orange Bowls or Sugar Bowls or even Sugar Plum Bowls dancing in 
their heads at Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"Are the folks in Ft. Collins appreciative?" Colorado State Athletic Director 
Oval Jaynes asked. "Some of the people at Colorado State are still stunned that 
he's our football coach." 
</P>
<P>
Mark Driscoll, a vice president at the Ft. Collins First Interstate Bank, was a 
quarterback for the Rams in the early '70s. During his first three years, 
Colorado State was 6-26-1. When the Rams went 6-5 during his senior season, it 
was cause for a town-wide celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"You didn't even dream about a bowl game," he said. "This football program has 
been so far down for so long that people used to say, 'If we just won a couple 
of games and got to .500, it'd be so great.' The fact that Earle has turned 
this thing around in two years and is taking this team to a bowl, it's just 
absolutely incredible." 
</P>
<P>
Driscoll remembers the press conference two years and a day ago, when Bruce was 
presented as the new coach at Colorado State, and Driscoll went to verify with 
his own eyes that this was really the same Earle Bruce who had that 17-year 
college coaching record of 132-67-1. 
</P>
<P>
"For Colorado State to get a guy with a track record like that was wonderful," 
he said. "Previous coaches had been assistants at major programs or guys who 
had won at the small-college level. We had never had a coach that won in the 
big time. And here was a guy who had won at the highest level. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember the excitement. It was, 'Hey, we got a guy here who knows what to 
do.' " 
</P>
<P>
There seems little doubt of that. All you have to do, as Bruce points out, is 
check that record. The man had three consecutive eight-victory seasons at Iowa 
State, for gosh sakes. 
</P>
<P>
"I've never doubted I could coach," he said. "If you go back and check my 
record, my God almighty, I don't know. . . . No matter where I've been, we've 
won, and we've won at one hell of a rate." 
</P>
<P>
And he's done it his way -- a little Woody Hayes, some George Patton and a 
generous portion of Andy Griffith -- but always the general who plans battle 
strategy and then climbs into the lead tank. 
</P>
<P>
"There are two kinds of coaches, I think, the players' coach and the 
administrative type," said Todd Yert, a senior fullback from Mission Viejo. 
"Coach Bruce is not only head coach, but he's offensive coordinator, and he 
also he runs everything else or at least puts his hand in everything. He wants 
to be in the middle of all of it." 
</P>
<P>
On the field, Bruce, 59, is a blood-and-guts type who screams with the best of 
them and has been known to make assistant coaches run wind sprints. He demands 
total effort all the time. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Bruce is a hard-core disciplinarian," Yert said. "He's into intensity 
and discipline on the field. It was a change from what we had before, but I 
think we all now understand where he's coming from. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, you can kid around with him about how conservative his Volvo is and 
he'll kid back. You can go in and just talk with him any time. But there's no 
joking on the field. On the field, he's a whole different man." 
</P>
<P>
The Colorado State football team obviously responded. "They just needed some 
attention," Bruce says. 
</P>
<P>
The Rams were not a talentless team before Bruce arrived. They were competitive 
if not very successful, a sort of Incredible Collapsing Football Team. The year 
before Bruce took over, the Rams lost eight games they were leading in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been around CSU football for 20 years, as a player, as an assistant coach 
for four years," Driscoll said, "and we've had some good players, and we'd play 
people tough and then find a way to lose. Earle has taught them to find a way 
to win. I think that's the most satisfying thing for some of us who've been 
around for years. It's really fun to finally have a team that doesn't beat 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
"And they've done it with hard work. The work ethic is so much different from 
when I was playing and coaching and from what I've seen of the previous 
coaching staffs. They just plain work harder." 
</P>
<P>
The pain of practice paid off for the Rams on Nov. 3 when they upset 
then-unbeaten Wyoming, 17-8. But Jaynes says the biggest victory of the year 
came Nov. 24 at Hawaii, after Colorado State had accepted a bid to the Freedom 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
"You know Hawaii, there's so many distractions," he said. "Then we got behind, 
21-3, and I was thinking, 'What a way to end the season.' But you know what? 
Earle would not let the kids lose that football game. I mean he just refused to 
let them lose. 
</P>
<P>
"To come back and beat them, 30-27, was the biggest win we had all year. We 
knew we were coming here, but you want to go into a bowl game feeling good 
about yourself." 
</P>
<P>
It's been that kind of a feel-good fall for the people of Ft. Collins, who have 
welcomed Bruce and his wife, Jean, into the community the way a Mercedes dealer 
welcomes a guy who just won the lottery into his showroom. While Bruce admits 
that he never would have left Ohio State if Jennings hadn't jettisoned him 
three years ago, he insists he has found peace and fulfillment in Ft. Collins. 
So why look back? 
</P>
<P>
"No matter where you coach, the most satisfying thing is to see your team play 
as well as they can and give great effort," he said. "And that's what's so 
satisfying about this team. They work hard in practice. They take coaching. 
They're great to be with. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun. I'm really enjoying what's going on for our program. I can see the 
spirit, attitude, development, enthusiasm. It's exciting. I've got a great home 
on a country club in a nice neighborhood and I really like it. Hell, I probably 
know my neighbors better in two years in Ft. Collins than I did in eight or 10 
years in Columbus." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE PAST 
</P>
<P>
He says he hasn't felt even the slightest temptation to thumb his nose at the 
Ohio State hierarchy and yell, "Who's sorry now?" And, because he's an alumnus, 
he says he has every right to criticize the lackluster success rate of Buckeye 
Coach John Cooper. But he really can only feel sorry for him. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce discovered that winning football games wasn't enough at Ohio State. Not 
winning them must be hell. He found out you had to be good at cocktail parties 
and board-room politicking. 
</P>
<P>
If he'd only known the meaning of schmooze back then. 
</P>
<P>
"I only know coaching," Bruce says. "I know how to coach a football team. And I 
know what's important. I don't sit back and wave a flag, I coach. I'm on the 
football field. I call the plays. I'm involved in everything. 
</P>
<P>
"Dealing with players, academics, recruiting -- I can do all of that. But if 
you're asking me to be someplace else where I'm not really needed, I'm not too 
interested in that. I want to promote the program. I don't mind going to alumni 
meetings and booster-club meetings, but I can't be doing something three times 
a day and still prepare to play football. I'm not here to blow smoke. I'm want 
to go do my job." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce took the Buckeyes to eight bowl games in nine years and had the best 
record in the Big Ten over those nine seasons, including two outright 
conference titles and two shared championships. But his inability -- or maybe 
his refusal -- to play the power brokers' game apparently cost him his job. 
</P>
<P>
He also made some powerful enemies when he decided to move his television show 
from WBNS, a station owned by the Wolfe family -- major contributors to Ohio 
State -- to another station. Bruce doesn't blame the Wolfes, but he does think 
WBNS General Manager Gene D'Angelo, a close friend of Jennings, played a major 
role in swaying opinion against him. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if anyone will ever know truly what happened there," Jaynes said, 
"but there's never been any doubt that Earle Bruce is one of the great coaches 
in the country today. He runs an honest program. He's a great teacher and a 
great motivator. Everywhere he's ever been, all he's done is win. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Earle harbors any ill feeling toward Ohio State. He'll always be 
a Buckeye. It's where he went to school, and certainly he has a lot of roots in 
state of Ohio. You don't spend 30 years of your life in a place and just forget 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce isn't trying that hard to forget, even though these are painful memories. 
At least he can now look back with some perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very hard to be appreciated in Columbus," he said. "Woody Hayes, when he 
was fired, then he was appreciated. I mean a lot of people appreciated him when 
he was there, but the ones who were doing the talking were the ones who didn't 
appreciate him. I saw the airplanes go around the stadium carrying banners to 
get rid of Woody and I heard the chants. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just part of Columbus, and you've got to be able to take it. They're 
just so used to winning. If you lose, you're a bum. If you win, you're just 
barely OK." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE FUTURE 
</P>
<P>
At Ohio State, Bruce worked in maintenance. At Colorado State, he's into 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
"There's always satisfaction when you build," he said. "When I see a guy build 
a house and he starts from scratch and it's a masterpiece, you get a lot of 
satisfaction from that. I'm not sure which job is more difficult, but I do know 
which job is more pleasing." 
</P>
<P>
Bruce hasn't had this much fun building since he turned around the program at 
Iowa State. And the people of Ft. Collins are ready to grab their tools and 
help. The Rams' average attendance this season was 26,244 in 30,000-seat Hughes 
Stadium, but Bruce hopes to see expansion in the quaint stadium at the base of 
the Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
"Earle and I have talked a lot about rebuilding this program and the long-term 
goals," said Jim Smith, a Ft. Collins investment consultant who played 
offensive guard for the Rams in the mid-'60s and is head of the former players' 
group. "He wants to leave this a much better place for the next coach. He says, 
'When we have trees lining the entrance to the stadium and new seats in both 
end zones to handle the big crowds, we'll know we've arrived.' " 
</P>
<P>
That day might not be too far off, given the waves of recruits arriving in Ft. 
Collins these days. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be there wasn't any way you could get in-state football recruits to 
even visit CSU," Smith said. "Now, when you read the local papers of the top 
recruits in the state and where they're making their visits, Colorado State is 
on almost every list. The kids recognize the fact that he's a national name, 
that he'll produce winning teams, that he'll get great players and that it's 
going to be a great program." 
</P>
<P>
Earle Bruce took a job at Northern Iowa for one year because he just couldn't 
bear to spend the football season in Columbus. He took the job at Colorado 
State because it seemed like a good place to do what he does best without 
complications and too many external pressures. He just hoped he wouldn't see 
any cartoons depicting him as an overweight, sloppy buffoon in the school 
newspaper. He never figured to be canonized, though. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question his leadership and his coaching ability are the reason 
we're in the Freedom Bowl," Jaynes said. "People in Colorado call him the Earle 
of Ft. Collins. He's not the John Wayne type, but he's concerned about his 
players and about getting the very best out of them on and off the field, and 
that's what coaching is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of frustrations can go through your life when you leave a place like 
Ohio State. But you have to tuck those frustrations away and get on down the 
road. With Earle, the last two years, I've seen the twinkle in his eye. And 
this football team means so much to him because of where we had to come from 
and where he had to come from."

INJURY TREND HITS MOON AND AIKMAN; 
</P>
<P>
QUARTERBACKS: BOTH WILL MISS KEY GAMES NEXT WEEK. EIGHT PASSERS HAVE BEEN 
FORCED TO LEAVE THE FIELD IN PAST TWO WEEKS. 
</P>

<P>
The pattern of quarterback injuries continued in the NFL Sunday, when Houston's 
Warren Moon suffered a dislocated thumb and Dallas' Troy Aikman suffered a 
dislocated right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Both are probably out for the season, although Moon might be able to return in 
three weeks if the Oilers make it that far in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys, despite their 17-3 loss to Philadelphia Sunday, can still qualify 
for the playoffs with a victory at Atlanta next Sunday, but Aikman is out for 
at least four weeks, and possibly longer. 
</P>
<P>
Eight quarterbacks have been injured in the past two weeks, including New 
England's Tommy Hodson, who suffered a sprained ankle in the second quarter of 
the Patriots' 42-7 loss to the New York Jets Sunday and did not return. 
</P>
<P>
In the same game, the Jets' Ken O'Brien was shaken up in the second quarter, 
but missed only two plays. 
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Minnesota's Wade Wilson, who was sidelined for most of the season 
because of a thumb injury, separated his right shoulder in the 28-24 loss to 
the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
The previous weekend, the injury list included Buffalo's Jim Kelly (knee), New 
York Giants' Phil Simms (foot), Cleveland's Bernie Kosar (broken thumb), and 
Kansas City's Steve DeBerg (broken little finger). 
</P>
<P>
Only DeBerg, whose injury was to his non-throwing hand, was able to play 
Sunday, and he threw for 251 yards and two touchdown in a 24-21 victory over 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Kelly and Simms might be able to return for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was injured Sunday when he caught his right thumb on a helmet in the 
closing minutes of a 40-20 loss to Cincinnati, which knocked the Oilers out of 
first place in the AFC Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
Team trainer Brad Brown said Moon would have surgery Sunday night to clean out 
the dislocated joint after the team returned to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking at three or four weeks before he'd be able to throw the football 
very well," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
The dislocated joint broke through the skin and was put back in place. 
</P>
<P>
Cody Carlson, who has completed 15 of 26 passes for one touchdown this season, 
will have to try to rally the Oilers to their first division title next Sunday 
night, when they play host to Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"People on this team are going to have to rally around him to get his 
confidence going," Moon said. "Our players know he can do the job. They see him 
in practice every day and they've seen him in game conditions. They know Cody 
can play." 
</P>
<P>
Moon's injury came one week after he had the second-best passing performance in 
NFL history, throwing for 527 yards against Kansas City. He hurt the thumb on 
an incomplete pass with 1:47 left in the game Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The injury comes at the end of Moon's most spectacular season. He matched Dan 
Marino's NFL record with nine 300-yard passing games, and was closing in on a 
number of Marino's other records. 
</P>
<P>
Moon finishes the regular season with 4,689 yards passing and 33 touchdowns, 
both league highs. He completed 342 of 584 throws. 
</P>
<P>
Moon suffered a broken bone in his throwing shoulder in the Oilers' 1988 
season-opening game against Indianapolis. He missed five games as a result. 
</P>
<P>
Moon was forced to leave a game against Cleveland on Nov. 30, 1986, when he hit 
his thumb on the helmet of a Browns' player while throwing. He missed one game 
because of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was the sixth quarterback the Eagles have knocked out of a game this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was decked by defensive end Clyde Simmons only 4:53 into the game. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw him coming and I got rid of the football," Aikman said. "It wasn't the 
hit. When I landed, I fell on the shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
He was replaced by Babe Laufenberg, who had one completion all year. Laufenberg 
was 13 of 36 for 140 yards and had four passes intercepted, including Eric 
Allen's 35-yard touchdown return in the fourth quarter.

EXPOS TRADE RAINES TO WHITE SOX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tim Raines was traded from the Montreal Expos to the Chicago White Sox on 
Sunday night for outfielder Ivan Calderon and pitcher Barry Jones, the 
Associated Press learned. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, which had been discussed since the winter meetings earlier this 
month, was completed when Raines agreed to a three-year contract worth more 
than $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Sources in both California and Chicago confirmed the trade, which is scheduled 
to be announced today. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, Montreal will get Jeff Carter, a minor league pitcher, and 
another minor league player to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
Raines hit .287 for the Expos last season with nine home runs and 62 runs 
batted in. In 10 seasons, Raines has a lifetime average of .301 and has 
averaged 63 stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>
Calderon hit .273 with 14 homers and 74 RBIs last season. In 1987, he emerged 
as a power hitter with 28 home runs and 83 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox acquired Calderon from Seattle in July 1986, completing a deal 
that sent catcher Scott Bradley to the Mariners. 
</P>
<P>
Jones, 27, was 11-4 with a 2.31 earned-run average and one save last season. 
Jones was used as a setup man for Bobby Thigpen, who set a major league record 
with 57 saves. 
</P>
<P>
Raines has been the subject of trade rumors for the past three seasons as the 
Expos tried to unload some of their expensive veterans. 
</P>
<P>
The White Sox were close to making the deal during the winter meetings in 
Chicago, but backed off after acquiring outfielder Cory Snyder from Cleveland 
for pitchers Eric King and Shawn Hillegas. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Manager Jeff Torborg said earlier this month he would bat Raines 
leadoff if the Sox could get him. 
</P>
<P>
Carter, 26, is a right-handed pitcher who was 8-3 at double-A Jacksonville last 
season with a 1.84 ERA in 52 games. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Schueler, Chicago's new general manager, would neither confirm nor deny the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be a press conference tomorrow morning," he said Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Reich, Raines' agent, also refused to confirm if the trade had been 
completed, saying only that there had been discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Raines, a seven-time All-Star, had spent his entire career with the Expos. He 
was taken in the fifth round of the June 1977 amateur draft and made it to the 
big leagues for good in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
He has batted .300 or better five times in 10 full seasons, and led the 
National League with a .334 average in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The next season, he was the victim of the owners' collusion against free agents 
and missed the month of April. He signed on May 1 and that afternoon he had 
four hits and drove in five runs against the New York Mets, including a 
game-winning grand slam. 
</P>
<P>
Raines led the NL in runs scored in 1983 and in 1987, even though he missed a 
month. 
</P>
<P>
The Expos originally had wanted pitcher Melido Perez as part of the deal, but 
it came together once they were convinced to take Jones.

RODGERS SUCCEEDS WITH HELP FROM HOME; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: IOWA QUARTERBACK MAKES ALL-BIG TEN TEAM WITH SUPPORT FROM HIS FATHER, 
EX-CELTIC COACH JIMMY RODGERS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's only natural for fathers to be interested in the athletic careers of their 
sons. The only drawback is many don't have enough time to become involved 
because of job commitments. 
</P>
<P>
That isn't a problem for Jimmy Rodgers, the former Boston Celtic coach. He has 
the time and financial security to do whatever he wants. 
</P>
<P>
So his avocation is watching his son, Matt, play quarterback for the Iowa 
Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"He's having the best time of his life," said Matt Rodgers, after a recent 
practice at Cal State Long Beach. "He has gone to all of our games, and he'll 
be here for the Rose Bowl game with Washington." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers was fired by the Celtics after they made an early exit from the 
playoffs last season. However, he had three years left on his contract, so he 
can indulge himself with Matt's football career. 
</P>
<P>
And, he can impart a bit of wisdom to his son -- not specifically about 
football, but from his coaching experience. 
</P>
<P>
"He teaches me how to deal with coaches, teammates and the press," Matt said. 
"The average father wouldn't know that. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's really getting into it (football). He wants to learn about the 
passing game such as how much I have to audible (change plays at the line of 
scrimmage) and why I would." 
</P>
<P>
Matt Rodgers said he used to be a Celtic fan, growing up from the sixth grade 
in Walpole, Mass., where he was a prep All-American quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I still love the players, but I lost faith in them (management)," Rodgers said 
after father was dismissed as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said he happened to be home when his father got a phone call, learning 
that he was no longer employed by the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
Jimmy Rodgers was a two-time most valuable basketball player for the Hawkeyes 
in the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I played a lot of basketball growing up," Matt said, "but they didn't have a 
strong program in high school. I wanted to play football and my father said, 
'Fine.' He never pushed me into doing anything." 
</P>
<P>
Because his father had been a basketball star at Iowa, Matt made a recruiting 
visit to the school. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to go there, but I liked the atmosphere and the people were so 
nice," said Rodgers, who also was recruited by Pittsburgh, Boston College and 
Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers was redshirted his freshman year, became a holder for kickers as a 
sophomore and inherited the starting quarterback job in the second game of the 
1989 season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a real tough year," said Rodgers of his team's 5-6 record. "I got into 
situations I've never been in before, and they usually went the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
As an inexperienced quarterback, he said he had problems recognizing defenses, 
then added, "But we had problems all over because we had a lot of young guys. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a lot of interceptions (13) because I was trying to make something 
happen that really wasn't there," Rodgers said. "I've learned to be more 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-4, 205-pound Rodgers has matured this season and so have the 
Hawkeyes, who were regarded as a second-division Big Ten team at the outset of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
He has completed 62.3% of his passes for 2,032 yards and 14 touchdowns and 
thrown seven interceptions. He has run for seven touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he was named to the all-Big Ten team, an honor that was bestowed on 
his predecessors, Chuck Long (1983-85) and Chuck Hartlieb (1987-88). 
</P>
<P>
"I never felt pressure from that," Rodgers said, referring to any notion that 
he would have to attain a level reached by Long and Hartlieb. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm my own quarterback. I don't compare myself to those guys, but I'd like to 
be talked about in the same sentences with them. We're a totally different team 
and I'm a different quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
Said Iowa Coach Hayden Fry: 
</P>
<P>
"Matt took over as a sophomore and people expected him to be a Houdini, another 
Long or Hartlieb. But he wasn't because he hadn't played. 
</P>
<P>
"However, after one year he was voted the all-Big Ten quarterback, and he's in 
the same mold as the other quarterbacks. He has eliminated a lot of mistakes 
that he made as a sophomore. He's more experienced, tougher and smarter. He's 
an excellent football player." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Don James said he was aware that Rodgers was an accomplished 
dropback passer, but after watching some videotapes of Iowa's games he said the 
tall quarterback is also used effectively on some option plays, as is his 
quarterback, Mark Brunell. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said that Iowa's confidence kept building throughout the season, adding 
that a turning point came in an early 48-21 loss to Miami. 
</P>
<P>
"It was in that game that we knew we could move the ball against a great team," 
Rodgers said. "We were only down, 24-21, at the start of the fourth quarter. 
Then, they blocked a punt and got two quick touchdowns. The final score didn't 
indicate how close the game was." 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers said that he's still trying to improve while directing what he says is 
a very intricate offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm still learning, but I think I have a good grasp of it (offense) now," he 
said. "I'm not trying to force (passes) downfield and, when everyone is 
covered, I'll dump off to our backs." 
</P>
<P>
He has been, of course, studying Washington's game films. 
</P>
<P>
"They look good, really fast, especially on defense," Rodgers said. "They play 
a lot of 'man' defense, and there are a lot things they can disguise to hurt 
us. But it's a type of defense where you can can spring some big plays on them, 
too."

EAGLES SLOW DOWN COWBOYS' PLAYOFF DRIVE, 17-3; 
</P>
<P>
NFC: BYARS LEADS PHILADELPHIA ATTACK, PASSING FOR ONE TOUCHDOWN AND SETTING UP 
A FIELD GOAL WITH AN INADVERTENT KICK OF A FUMBLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
Keith Byars of the Philadelphia Eagles continues to make a case for himself as 
the NFL's most versatile player. 
</P>
<P>
Byars, who is listed as a running back, played tight end, wide receiver, 
blocking back and also did some passing Sunday during the Eagles' 17-3 victory 
over the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
Byars threw his fourth touchdown pass in as many attempts this season to give 
the Eagles a 7-0 first-quarter lead. He also gained 27 yards in six carries, 
caught three passes for 21 yards, led the blocking as the Eagles rushed for 178 
yards and inadvertently kicked a fumbled ball 45 yards to set up a 29-yard 
field goal by Roger Ruzek. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagles (9-6) can lock up the home-field advantage for the NFC wild-card 
playoff game against Washington with a win at Phoenix on Saturday. Despite 
their first loss in five games, the Cowboys (7-8) can claim the NFC's final 
playoff spot with a victory next week at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Byars, who throws left-handed, fooled the Cowboys on his option pass in the 
first quarter by rolling right, instead of left, as he had on his other three 
attempts. He connected with Calvin Williams on an 18-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew it would catch them off guard throwing to my right," said Byars, who 
is in his fifth season out of Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Eagle quarterback Randall Cunningham completed 16 of 28 passes for 144 yards 
and rushed for 54 yards on four carries. Cunningham is 87 yards short of Bobby 
Douglass' NFL single-season record of 969 rushing yards by a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
Troy Aikman became the sixth quarterback to be knocked out by the Eagles' 
defense this season. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was taken down by defensive end Clyde Simmons and left the game with 
10:07 remaining in the first quarter with a dislocated right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
Aikman was replaced by Babe Laufenberg, who had one completion this season. 
Laufenberg completed 13 of 36 passes for 140 yards and had four passes 
intercepted, including one in the fourth quarter that Eric Allen returned 35 
yards for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four interceptions, the Eagles also had a pair of sacks and 
held the Cowboys to 199 total yards.

BRONCOS' MIRACLE FINISH GOES FOR NAUGHT; 
</P>
<P>
AFC: MICHAEL YOUNG CATCHES ELWAY'S 51-YARD, LAST-SECOND PASS, BUT PLAY IS 
NULLIFIED BY MOTION PENALTY AND SEATTLE WINS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Denver Broncos agreed with an officials' critical call that cost them the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
An illegal motion penalty wiped out a last-second John Elway touchdown pass 
Sunday night, preserving Seattle's 17-12 victory over the Broncos and keeping 
the Seahawks alive in the race for a playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good call," Elway said. 
</P>
<P>
Denver receivers Michael Young and Shannon Sharpe were called for the penalty. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw them moving," Elway said. "I waved at them to (stop) where they were, 
but they didn't." 
</P>
<P>
"The referee (Jim Tunney) said they weren't set for a full count," Denver Coach 
Dan Reeves said. 
</P>
<P>
"Two men were moving," Tunney said. "They came out of the huddle and never did 
set. They were in motion." 
</P>
<P>
As time expired, Elway threw a 51-yard pass that Young caught on the back 
boundary of the end zone. The official covering the play signalled that the 
catch was good, but a flag had already been thrown in the Denver backfield, 
negating the play and ending the game. 
</P>
<P>
With 1:36 left, Elway's throw to Young in the end zone was picked off by 
Seattle's Melvin Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
When the Seahawks were unable to run out the clock, Denver (4-11) had one more 
chance with 26 seconds to play. Elway threw two end zone incompletions to Young 
before hooking up with him on the ill-fated final play. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the longest 26 seconds of my life," Seahawk strong safety Nesby 
Glasgow said. 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Robinson's interception and 39-yard runback to the Denver 11 set up 
Derrick Fenner's one-yard touchdown run with 11 seconds late in the third 
quarter that gave Seattle a 17-12 lead. Dave Krieg passed nine yards to Brian 
Blades for a first down at the Denver one, and Fenner scored from there. 
</P>
<P>
"The defense really played good," Krieg said. "We had two big interceptions." 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks (8-7) can go to the playoffs by beating Detroit in the Kingdome 
next Sunday if Pittsburgh beats Houston or Cleveland beats Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
Denver got to the Seattle 28, 40 and 36 on three possessions in the fourth 
quarter, but each time was turned away. 
</P>
<P>
"Denver always is in it when Elway has the ball," Seahawk cornerback Patrick 
Hunter said. "He's got great scrambling ability and a great arm. He's such a 
good player." 
</P>
<P>
Denver went ahead 12-10 with a safety with 3:29 left in the third quarter when 
the officials called Krieg for intentional grounding while standing in the 
Seattle end zone. The safety was ruled when Krieg was passing on a third-and-13 
with the line of scrimmage at the Seattle seven. 
</P>
<P>
The Seahawks tied the score at 10-10 just 42 seconds before halftime on a 
five-yard pass from Krieg to Tommy Kane. 
</P>
<P>
Seattle went 60 yards in 10 plays, including a 19-yard run by Krieg to the 
Denver 14. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive end David Galloway of the Broncos and offensive tackle Ronnie Lee of 
the Seahawks were ejected for fighting after Krieg completed a seven-yard pass 
to the Bronco two. Denver cornerback Alton Montgomery was thrown out on the 
same play for ripping Paul Skansi's helmet off. Officials ruled Montgomery 
deliberately tried to injure Skansi. 
</P>
<P>
Denver took a 10-3 lead at 12:11 of the second quarter after Dennis Smith 
intercepted a Krieg pass and returned it 13 yards to the Seattle 27. The 
Broncos scored six plays later on a one-yard run by Bobby Humphrey. 
</P>
<P>
David Treadwell of the Broncos kicked a 49-yard field goal and the Seahawks' 
Norm Johnson kicked a 21-yarder in the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Treadwell was short on a 50-yard field goal attempt in the second quarter. He 
also was wide to the right with a 45-yard field goal try with 9:26 left with 
Seattle in front 17-12.

With two Germanys becoming one, speculation was that a sports superpower would 
be created that would bury the Soviet Union and the United States. Instead, the 
Germans have been shoveling dirt on themselves with revelations about steroid 
use on both sides of the wall, particularly the east side. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: When East German women swimmers were suspected of drug use at the 1976 
Summer Olympics in Montreal because of their deep voices, their coach said, "We 
came to swim, not sing." Fourteen years later, some East Germans with pipelines 
to newspaper reporters are proving that they can sing, too. 
</P>
<P>
TOKYO -- Atlanta accomplished something that it couldn't do in the Civil War; 
it seceded from the Union. 
</P>
<P>
When rival cities protested that Atlanta shouldn't play host to the 1996 Summer 
Olympics because the United States had the Games only 12 years before in Los 
Angeles, the Georgians countered that they actually are Southerners instead of 
Americans. Southerners, they said, never have had the Games. 
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee bought it. In a vote in Tokyo, Atlanta 
finished ahead of sentimental favorite Athens. Athens supporters charged that 
IOC members were bought by Coca-Cola, which is headquartered in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: In Greek cafes all over the world, they are saying, "No Coke. Pepsi." 
</P>
<P>
ROME -- Forget the record books that say West Germany won the World Cup with a 
victory in the final over Argentina. The real winners in an otherwise 
forgettable soccer tournament were the Indomitable Lions from Cameroon. 
</P>
<P>
In reaching the quarterfinals, they proved that teams don't necessarily have to 
play conservative, dull, unimaginative soccer to win. Hoping to see other teams 
kick caution to the wind, the sport's bosses gave Africa a third automatic 
berth in the 1994 World Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: Has anyone besides Cameroon scored yet? 
</P>
<P>
PARIS -- Since Horst Dassler of Germany died a couple of years ago, there has 
been a void in international sports. The IOC and FIFA, which governs soccer, 
have had to run themselves. Enter Bernard Tapie, the Frenchman who bought 
Adidas last summer. He wasn't buying just a sports apparel company; he was 
trying to buy Dassler's influence. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't likely to happen because Tapie is perceived to have neither the 
integrity nor character of Dassler. Considering the controversy that constantly 
surrounds Tapie's French soccer team, Olympique Marseille, a more appropriate 
comparison would be to George Steinbrenner. 
</P>
<P>
Tapie has been both the accused and the accuser in bribery allegations. Now, 
his team is under investigation for its alleged financial irregularities. The 
coach, Franz Beckenbauer, recently moved to the front office because of 
confusion about who runs the team and may be out entirely before spring. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: The French are different from you and me. 
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG -- The IOC was the first multinational organization to suspend 
South Africa because of its official policy of racial separation. Now, IOC 
President Juan Antonio Samaranch says the IOC will be the first to welcome back 
South Africa when it eliminates apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
There have been several meetings this year between South African sports 
officials and IOC delegates. An IOC delegation will make its first visit to 
Johannesburg in April. Samaranch predicts that the South Africans will compete 
in 1996 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: Samaranch should be drug tested. He's sprinting faster than Ben 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
BARCELONA -- An Italian team took the New York Knicks into overtime in the 
McDonald's Cup in Barcelona. So it was the Knicks' first exhibition game. It 
won't be long before some Italian, Spanish and Yugoslav teams are at least as 
good as the Miami Heat. 
</P>
<P>
NBA Commissioner David Stern announced that the NBA champions will play the 
champions of various European leagues in a preseason tournament that will start 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: You read it here first. By the end of the decade, basketball's 
visionaries, such as Stern, will arrange a postseason series between the best 
teams in the NBA and Europe to achieve a true world championship and an 
international marketing bonanza. 
</P>
<P>
PARIS -- The athlete of the last decade, Greg LeMond, is off to a good start in 
becoming the athlete of this decade. He won the Tour de France for the third 
time, including two in a row. The French will attempt to make it tougher for 
him next year, eliminating some of the more difficult mountain stages. He 
usually handles those as if he's riding a Harley-Davidson. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: It's a good thing for LeMond that those drug tests that tell you what 
an athlete ate for breakfast six months ago can't also determine nationality. 
Could this guy really be an American? 
</P>
<P>
INDIANAPOLIS -- Although the drug-testing program supervised by The Athletics 
Congress, which governs track and field in the United States, remains in 
turmoil, two American world record-holders, shotputter Randy Barnes and 
quarter-miler Butch Reynolds, tested positive for steroids in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Less than 8,000 people over three days attended the national championships last 
summer. The country's most prestigious indoor meet, the Millrose Games in New 
York, doesn't have a sponsor. Other meets, indoors and outdoors, are dead or 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: Who's responsible for this sport in the United States, and why does he 
still have a job? 
</P>
<P>
LOS ANGELES -- An L.A. lawyer, Alan Rothenberg, took over as president of the 
U.S. Soccer Federation. Another L.A. lawyer, Charles Cale, became chief 
executive officer of the 1994 World Cup organizing committee. Directly under 
him is Scott LeTellier, a Newport Beach lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: By the time World Cup arrives, the only L.A. lawyer who's going to 
still be practicing law is Leland McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
SEATTLE -- Not even Jane Fonda could get the Goodwill Games in shape. Goodwill 
Games II lost even more money than Goodwill Games I. Nevertheless, Ted Turner 
convinced the members of his board of directors that there should be a Goodwill 
Games III in 1994 in Moscow and Leningrad. 
</P>
<P>
Comment: Ted Turner is different from you and me.

<P>
WINNER OF HOIST THE FLAG PROVIDES SATISFACTION ($25.60) TO HIS BACKERS

Considering Satis' record, it was a bit surprising the 2-year-old, French-bred 
colt wasn't given more respect at the mutuel windows before Sunday's $112,800 
Hoist The Flag Stakes at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, he had been competing at some of France's lesser tracks, but he had 
won four times on turf, equaling the total of the 11 other members of the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Satis was only the fifth choice at nearly 12-1 and paid $25.60 in 
winning the Grade III race before 18,101. 
</P>
<P>
Last for six furlongs under Corey Black, Satis rallied widest of all into the 
stretch, accelerated impressively and won going away in 1:35 1/5 for the mile 
on turf. 
</P>
<P>
In the process, he gave trainer Christian Doumen his first U.S. stakes victory 
and a quick return on a $150,000 investment. Doumen had bought Satis in France 
earlier this year, and Sunday's success was worth $67,800 to his owner, Jean 
Laurent Andreani. 
</P>
<P>
"I bought him at an auction where we had gone to buy Mister Riv, who was 
running in the Arc (de Triomphe) the next day," Doumen said. "We bought Mister 
Riv, but I saw this little horse and liked him. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to pay a little more money than I thought, but he's worth it now. He 
was running in the French bushes, and he had a tough time when he got here. 
</P>
<P>
"He got a temperature the first month. Then, I got him right, and I wanted to 
keep him fresh for this stake. He kicked in very well at the end. He was 
flying." 
</P>
<P>
In beating 14-1 shot What A Spell by 1 1/4 lengths, Satis completed the last 
quarter in less than 23 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked him once in the morning and he went nice," Black said. "(Doumen) told 
me to try to get him covered up because he'd probably pull, but he didn't pull. 
He was kind of timid all the way. The turf was flying and he kept ducking and 
turning his head. 
</P>
<P>
"I got him in the clear on the turn, and he just kept finding momentum. It just 
turned into a sprint for him. The way he moved, there weren't very many horses 
who were going to outsprint him." 
</P>
<P>
Able to set slow fractions (23 2/5, 47 2/5 and 1:11 1/5 for six furlongs), What 
A Spell outfinished 5-2 favorite Ev For Shir by a head for place with Mucho 
Precious another head back in third. 
</P>
<P>
Making his debut for trainer Bill Spawr, Ev For Shir suffered his first loss in 
three starts in his initial try on grass, but Alex Solis wasn't discouraged. 
</P>

"He's a nice horse, but he's still pretty green," he said. "He will improve a 
lot. He really doesn't know what he's doing. Time will tell, but I think he's 
going to turn out to be a real nice horse." 
</P>
<P>
Wide Colony, the 3-1 second choice who had much trouble when third in his first 
turf start last month, was never a factor, finishing sixth. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't fire at all," Eddie Delahoussaye said. "He never kicked for me." 
</P>
<P>
Hollywood Park will conclude its 37-day meeting today with the $85,300 Auld 
Lang Syne Handicap at 1 1/4 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
Flanders Moss, an impressive allowance winner Dec. 8 at the same distance, 
would have been one of the favorites in the Auld Lang Syne, but he has been 
scratched. It was discovered he was ineligible for the race, which is 
restricted to horses who have not won $35,000 at a mile or more since July 23. 
A 3-year-old Shareef Dancer gelding, Flanders Moss earned $38,000 when winning 
a race in France Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
His ineligibility leaves a field of nine, including two females. Betty Lobelia, 
a 5-year-old Assert mare, upset Girl Of France in her California debut Dec. 5 
for trainer Rick Mettee. She has placed in 18 of 26 starts on turf and has 
earned more than $436,000. Corey Black will again ride. 
</P>
<P>
The other entrants are Lyphard's Melody, a filly who went virtually 
wire-to-wire Dec. 7 for trainer Bill Shoemaker; Dream Of Fame; Intelligently; 
Davon; Deliorman; Royal Reach; Top Apple and Coat Hanger, a 7-year-old gelding 
who will be making the 131st start of his career.

Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Post time will be 12:30 p.m., a half-hour earlier than usual. . . . Jockey Alex 
Solis had two winners Sunday, scoring with maiden Alinda in the second and War 
Commandress in the seventh. He now has 42 winners at the meeting and has 
clinched second place in the standings behind Chris McCarron. . . . Gary Jones 
has wrapped up the trainer's race. Let's Go Flying's victory in the sixth was 
the 15th for Jones, putting him three ahead of Ron McAnally and four up on Bill 
Spawr.

HIGH VACANCY RATES LEAD TO SWEET DEALS FOR OFFICE TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, SAN DIEGO COUNTY BUSINESS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Attorney David Brewer figured it would be a good time to shop for a new office 
lease -- but he had no idea it would be this good. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer's law firm is about to renew its lease at an upscale San Diego office 
building for 15% less rent than it agreed to three years ago. The deal will cap 
months of shopping and dickering with eager-to-please landlords in the 
overbuilt San Diego office market. 
</P>
<P>
The bargaining paid off: Brewer's firm is also getting an above-average 
interior improvement allowance and the right to expand to an upper floor and 
connect it with a stairwell. 
</P>
<P>
The deal signed by Brewer's firm is hardly unique. Southern California office 
tenants large and small are signing very favorable leases these days, 
capitalizing on the region's severely overbuilt office markets. And deals could 
get even sweeter amid expectations that vacancy rates will rise even further in 
the near future as new office buildings come on line. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the pressure on landlords is the declining economy and cutbacks 
among prime tenant groups, such as banking, accounting and legal firms. As a 
result, landlords have lowered rates and dangled even more financial incentives 
to hook tenants from the shrinking pool of prospects. 
</P>
<P>
"Kickers" being offered to prospective tenants include several months of free 
rent, moving allowances, athletic club memberships, lease "buy-downs" or 
assumptions, extra parking spaces and even signing bonuses to large tenants 
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are looking to sign a lease, there are better deals to be made today 
then there have been for the last several years," said Derek Thomas, director 
of real estate consulting at the San Diego office of Kenneth Leventhal &amp; 
Co., an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
"People are less likely to move now, and so, to entice people, landlords have 
to offer better deals. It's the age-old supply-and-demand story. There is 
tremendous supply and demand . . . That's why it's a tenant's market," said 
Brewer, whose firm, Saxon, Dean, Mason, Brewer &amp; Kincannon, will soon 
double its office space to 36,000 square feet at the Regent's Square building 
in the University Towne Center area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The implications of the rent slashing are already visible in the financial 
problems of insurance companies, which own many downtown high-rises across the 
country. Many less-capitalized developers have defaulted on loans or gone 
bankrupt. But brokers say the goal of most landlords remains, above all, to cut 
whatever deals necessary to fill their buildings in advance of what could 
become an even worse economy. 
</P>
<P>
Given the grim prognosis for the economy in general and for commercial real 
estate in particular, some experts think rent concessions could last for years. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California office market generally has been soft for much of the 
past decade, with waves of new office construction keeping vacancy rates at 
double-digit levels. Current vacancy rates in the region -- 18% in downtown San 
Diego, 23% in Orange County and 21% in downtown Los Angeles -- are close to 
all-time levels and heading up. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, for example, an office glut is expected to get worse 
as several new buildings are being completed. 
</P>
<P>
The few tenants out shopping for sizable leases are getting the full-court 
press from building owners and their brokers. Within Southern California, this 
deal-making is perhaps most evident in San Diego, where office vacancies in 
some areas of the city are running close to 40%. 
</P>
<P>
One tenant benefiting from this largess is Transamerica Insurance Group of San 
Diego. It will soon sign a lease at close to 40% less than the landlord's 
original asking price for the company's new 14,000-square-foot office in San 
Diego's University Towne Center area. 
</P>
<P>
"Once the word leaked out we were looking (for new offices), we had quite a few 
brokers come to us with deals," said Michael H. Scott, Transamerica's resident 
vice president in San Diego. "So we saw twice as many buildings as we 
anticipated. That was the true clue that the market was soft." 
</P>
<P>
A major factor in downtown rents staying cheap is the overbuilding of offices 
in many suburban markets and the threat they pose to downtown landlords of 
luring tenants out of city centers. As a result, owners of major downtown 
buildings have had to cut rates to compete, said Joel Mayne, marketing director 
of Tishman West Cos. in San Diego, owner of the 250,000-square-foot Bank of 
America building in downtown San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of all those market factors, "effective" office rental rates -- the 
term for the entire lease-financing package that takes into account all 
financial incentives, including free rent -- are at the lowest levels in recent 
memory in many Southern California cities. A tenant signing a five-year lease 
these days is likely to get one year of it free, said Dennis Cruzan, principal 
of Centremark, a San Diego development firm. 
</P>
<P>
And the great deals -- which not so long ago were available only to powerhouse, 
multifloor tenants, such as banks, law and accounting firms -- are now out 
there for firms large and small, Thomas added. That's because the larger 
tenants these days are as likely to be shrinking than growing, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"The major downtown tenants are banks, law firms and accountants, and we are 
seeing major cutbacks in staffing" at those kinds of firms, Thomas said. 
"Accountants Laventhol &amp; Horwath just went into bankruptcy. That's an 
indication that CPA firms in general won't be aggressively growing and taking 
large amounts of space." 
</P>
<P>
John Messner, president of Meridian Capital Management of San Diego, said his 
firm was "surprised at the clout we had" in negotiating with downtown San Diego 
office landlords. "We're only 2,000 square feet, which is not that large." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Messner's money management firm negotiated a five-year lease 
renewal at "more than 15%" less rent than he signed for five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Good office lease deals can be had throughout the region. In Orange County's 
prime office district -- located within a three-mile radius of John Wayne 
Airport -- rents are typically $1.65 to $1.85 per square foot per month, 20% 
less than three years ago, said Scott Perley, vice president and branch manager 
at the Irvine branch of Cushman &amp; Wakefield of California, a major 
commercial real estate brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, office rents are have been declining 5% to 10% a year (in 
Orange County) for three years," Perley said. 
</P>
<P>
In downtown Los Angeles, monthly rents at top-class office buildings range 
between $1.50 and $2.50 per square foot -- about 15% less than two years ago, 
factoring in all concessions, said Carl Muhlstein, executive vice president of 
Wilrock National of California, a commercial real estate brokerage with offices 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown Los Angeles office rents will get even cheaper next year, Muhlstein 
predicts, because the district will be flooded over the next 14 months with a 
new crop of buildings now under construction totaling about 6.4 million square 
feet of space. That's more than three times the office space leased in a 
typical year, Muhlstein said. Thus, vacancy rates in downtown Los Angeles will 
approach 30% by the end of 1991, Muhlstein predicted. 
</P>
<P>
But brokers say no major Southern California city has more of an office glut 
than San Diego, where vacancy rates range from 18% in the downtown district to 
25% in the Mission Valley area to higher than 35% in the University Towne 
Center and Sorrento Mesa areas in the northern part of the city, said Russ 
Stai, a commercial real estate broker with John Burnham &amp; Co. in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodletting among developers has caused one of the city's largest, Naiman 
development, developer of the Naiman Tech Center in the Sorrento Mesa area, to 
default on a $70-million loan to HomeFed Bank. That Naiman is now quoting rents 
at $1.10 per square foot per month, down from $1.75 per square foot when the 
project opened in 1983, is just another example of the competitive climate in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
Tenants aren't complaining. Pacific Bell still hasn't made up its mind among 
five "finalist" locations for a multifloor block of office space it wants in 
downtown San Diego. But wherever it is, Terry Churchill, the phone company's 
San Diego-area vice president, said he expects to ultimately pay at least 15% 
less in annual rent than he would have had to pay three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Churchill, who admits to "playing one landlord off another" in his lease 
negotiations, said he has seen a new kind of incentive dangled before him in 
the current round of lease negotiations: the right to cancel a lease earlier 
than the specified term. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of escape clause is attractive to many tenants because "most 
businesses are downsizing due to the economy and automation. So companies, not 
just specifically Pacific Bell, are not as interested in making long-term 
commitments until the market conditions changes or firms up," Churchill said. 
</P>
<P>
Just how long the current oversupply of office space -- and attractive lease 
deals -- will last is subject to debate. While most industry officials agree 
that few new office projects will be started because of the scarcity of 
financing, others insist that the huge amount of office space already under 
construction and coming on stream over the next year or so will create an 
"overhang" that could keep the office market soft for years.

JAPAN'S MIGHTY ECONOMY SEEMS TO BE SLOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE HELM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
TOKYO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, the Japanese economy has boomed, sucking in more and more products 
from abroad while flooding world markets with exports of everything from cars 
to computers. 
</P>
<P>
But sharp stock price declines, rising interest rates and declining property 
values are finally taking their toll. Automobile sales are slowing. Machinery 
orders are falling, along with businesses' capital spending plans. Corporate 
profits are flat. Big bankruptcies are rising. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Japan's muscular economy is showing signs of tiring -- and may 
even be flirting with recession. 
</P>
<P>
That's bad news for the U.S. economy. Economists have looked to Japanese 
imports of products and exports of capital to help keep the expected American 
recession shallow and short. But lower growth in Japanese consumer spending and 
capital investments will substantially reduce that nation's purchases of U.S. 
goods, possibly reversing hard-won gains by American firms in Japanese markets. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's troubles may hurt American companies at home too. As the Japanese 
economy sours, firms in such industries as autos and semiconductors will try to 
sell their excess production in the United States rather than cut production 
and lay off workers. The result? More Japanese market share at the expense of 
American rivals. 
</P>
<P>
The Japanese slowdown could also contribute to a worldwide credit crunch. 
Experts predict that with fewer exports and higher costs of oil imports, Japan 
will become a net importer of capital early next year. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Japan, which has plowed its capital surplus into financing 
investment around the world, could temporarily end up competing with U.S. and 
European companies for scarce capital. Already, Japanese financial institutions 
are pulling money out of U.S. stocks, bonds and real estate, putting upward 
pressure on U.S. interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
At first glance, Japan doesn't look like a nation headed for a downturn. 
Department stores, most of which have been plastered with Christmas trimmings 
for nearly two months, are packed with shoppers. And that's before employees 
have received their fat end-of-year bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. firms say their sales in Japan remain strong. U.S. exports of machinery 
and computer equipment nearly doubled to $14.7 billion last year from 1986. 
Digital Equipment Corp., with 3,800 employees in Japan, says it continues to 
grow at a rate of more than 20% a year. Only the difficulty of hiring new 
workers is limiting growth, it says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet subtler signs paint a different picture. 
</P>
<P>
After rising steadily for 20 months, Japanese automobile sales in November were 
down 2.7% from the year before. Growth in housing starts is down sharply, and 
corporate profits have been flat most of the year. 
</P>
<P>
In the past couple of months, Japan has seen a rise in bankruptcies, reversing 
a steady decline since 1986, according to Teikoku Data Bank, an information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Kyowa, a construction company that borrowed heavily to speculate in real 
estate, has filed for bankruptcy, becoming Japan's third-largest bankruptcy 
since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
A branch manager of Itoman Co., another company whose real estate debts 
threaten to swarm it, drowned himself in his bathtub as government 
investigations into the company's highly leveraged real estate deals broadened. 
</P>
<P>
High interest rates and falling asset values are depressing consumption, while 
declining corporate profits are dampening spending on new factories. Many small 
firms that have not speculated in real estate say they too are in danger of 
going bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
"The symptoms of recession have come out surprisingly quickly in recent days," 
says Makoto Sakurai, chief economist at Taisho Research Institute Co., an 
independent think tank. Japan has not been in a recession since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
Individuals and companies with real estate or stocks are already beginning to 
feel some pain. In October, Tadami Umezawa put his $400,000-plus house, 1 hour 
away from Tokyo, on the market at a price suggested by the broker. He has 
lowered his price 10%, but still no buyers. Unless he can sell, he can't afford 
the land to build a new home closer to work. 
</P>
<P>
"High interest rates are the main problem," says Umezawa. "They could bring 
down the economy." 
</P>
<P>
Many executives agree. Seventy-five percent expect a downturn by next summer, 
according to a recent survey. Most are angry at the Bank of Japan's policy of 
keeping interest rates high. 
</P>
<P>
With the economy treading water in Japan and shrinking in the United States, 
earnings are headed for sharp declines. Jesper Koll, chief economist at S. G. 
Warburg Securities' Japan branch, predicts that profits will fall 18.5% in 1991 
from this year. Lower earnings, combined with higher capital costs, he argues, 
will force companies to reduce growth in capital spending to 5.3% next year 
from 17.8% in 1989 and 14% estimated for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Koll says Japan's economy will shrink on a quarter-to-quarter basis in the 
first half of next year, although for the year growth will remain a healthy 
3.6%. 
</P>
<P>
Salomon Bros. Asia Ltd. forecasts import growth slowing to 4.8% from 8.3% last 
year. U.S. exports of food may remain steady, but beef, lumber, semiconductors 
and computers are expected to fall. 
</P>
<P>
High-tech sales are likely to decline more rapidly than overall imports as 
Japanese firms cut purchases from foreign suppliers and return to Japanese 
buyers. U.S. semiconductor makers are already seeing their market share shrink 
after several years of growth. 
</P>
<P>
As domestic markets shrink, Japanese companies will aim their excess capacity 
at the U.S. market. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Honda predicted that its U.S. plants would become a production base 
for exports to Japan. Instead, the capacity is feeding a boom in U.S. sales. 
Honda's American sales grew 25% in the last 10 days of November from 
year-earlier numbers, while they fell 27.9% in Japan for the month. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most observers predict a continued slowdown in Japanese investment 
overseas. 
</P>
<P>
A weaker economy will also shrink Japan's role as banker to the world. Japanese 
purchases of U.S. stocks were 89% below year-earlier levels between April and 
October, bond purchases down 72%. 
</P>
<P>
Koll predicts that Japan's capital surplus (its excess of capital outflows over 
inflows), which fell from $79 billion in 1988 to an estimated $35 billion this 
year, will actually become a capital deficit of $8 billion in the first half of 
1991. The key reason: a rise in imports caused by higher oil prices, coming as 
exports are slowing. 
</P>
<P>
A cooling economy is what Japan's government planners want. Prices, already the 
highest in the world, rose 3.9% in November from the year before -- the fastest 
growth since 1982. Slower growth should help moderate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
In April, after the spring wage offensive -- when unions negotiate industrywide 
raises with employers -- most observers believe that the Bank of Japan will 
lower interest rates again, helping to rejuvenate the economy and make U.S. 
bond markets more attractive. 
</P>
<P>
Higher public works spending, which Japan promised the United States in recent 
trade talks, should also begin kicking in then.

L.A. GEAR TOPS FORBES' PROFITABILITY RANKINGS;

EARNINGS: THE ATHLETIC FOOTWEAR MAKER HAS HAD AN AVERAGE RETURN ON EQUITY OF 
83.2% THE PAST FOUR YEARS, THE MAGAZINE SAYS.

<P>
Athletic footwear maker L.A. Gear enjoyed the best long-term profitability of 
nearly 1,200 U.S. corporations surveyed by Forbes magazine, the magazine 
announced Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles-based company has averaged an 83.2% return on equity -- primary 
earnings per share divided by common shareholders' equity per share -- in the 
past four years, according to Forbes' calculations. In the last 12 months, the 
company's profitability performance has slipped a bit. Its return on equity was 
27.8% during that period, the magazine said. 
</P>
<P>
St. Louis-based Pulitzer Publishing ranked second in profitability with an 
80.6% average return on equity the past five years. Atlanta-based chemical 
maker Georgia Gulf was third with 78.4% the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes evaluated the profitability of 1,177 companies in 20 industries for its 
Jan. 7, 1991, annual report issue. 
</P>
<P>
Software maker Microsoft Corp., based in Redmond, Wash., was the most 
profitable large corporation. Microsoft had an average return on investment of 
50.4% the past five years, which landed it in 16th place on the general list. 
</P>
<P>
To be considered among the largest companies, a firm had to have sales of more 
than $1 billion and a minimum five-year average return on equity of 22%. 
</P>
<P>
The median company in Forbes' survey had a five-year average return on 
investment of 14.6%, up from 14.3% in 1989. The firms' return on investment for 
the latest 12 months dropped, however, from 14.4% to 12.1%. 
</P>
<P>
Leading Forbes' list of best-performing stocks was Blockbuster Entertainment. 
The Fort Lauderdale, Fla.-based video rental company had a five-year average 
stock price increase of 3,060.5%. A total of 1,078 stocks were surveyed. 
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Minerals, an Englewood, Colo.-based oil, gas and coal company, had the 
highest rate of earnings-per-share growth -- a three-year average of 147.8%. 
</P>
<P>
Forbes considers companies with annual revenue of $400 million -- or $600 
million for banks or electric utilities -- for its annual report issue. 
</P>
<P>
The only exception is biotechnology, a relatively new industry with a long lead 
time between research and development and actual products. 
</P>
<P>
The magazine based most of its rankings on five-year averages, although there 
were some exceptions.

German 'Boom Year': While Americans could well spend 4% less on Christmas 
holiday shopping this year, Germany is experiencing a boom. 
</P>
<P>
German holiday shoppers are expected to spend up to 10% more this year than 
last, in large part because of reunification. In early December, F. W. 
Woolworth Co. reopened a store in Halle, formerly part of East Germany, to 
300-yard lines of customers. The company is planning to open at least 50 stores 
the next three to five years. The Communications Electronics Assn. in Frankfurt 
says its members' sales already exceed 7 billion deutsche marks for items such 
as stereos, television sets, radios and video recorders.

The Pan Am Pilots Association said Sunday that it would support either of two 
rival efforts to acquire the airline. 
</P>
<P>
The Iowa Acquisition Group, based in Waterloo, Iowa, said it made a 
$450-million offer for Pan Am last Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Pan Am said it was considering a $375 million buyout offer from 
Trans World Airlines Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am, however, requested that TWA provide bridge financing for its immediate 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Charles Caudle of the pilots group said the Iowa Acquisition Group might 
be able to provide Pan Am with bridge financing. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am spokesman Jeff Kriendler had no comment on the pilots' statement. 
However a source close to Pan Am said it was not clear whether the Iowa 
Acquisition Group's offer was credible. 
</P>
<P>
The group has declined to identify any of its prospective investment bankers.

JAPAN PREDICTS AN EASING OF GROWTH FROM 5.2% TO 3.8%; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE 1991-92 FISCAL YEAR ALSO WILL SEE A NARROWING OF ITS TRADE SURPLUS 
AND A 9.2% SURGE IN IMPORTS, THE GOVERNMENT FORECASTS.

<P>
Japan is forecasting slower economic growth and small declines in its trade and 
balance of payments surpluses in the fiscal year starting April 1. 
</P>
<P>
The government predicted Saturday that gross national product would grow 3.8% 
in real terms in 1991-92 after rising 5.2% in the current year. 
</P>
<P>
Japan's trade surplus is expected to narrow to around $56 billion next fiscal 
year from an estimated $57 billion this year. The surplus in the current 
account of its balance of payments is seen shrinking to about $30 billion from 
around $32 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"Japan's economy, although slowing a bit, will keep growing next fiscal year, 
led by domestic demand," said an official of the Economic Planning Agency, 
which released the forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
He said the economy, which entered its fifth year of expansion this month, was 
likely to enjoy its longest post-war growth period. The longest boom previously 
was 57 months -- from November, 1965, to July, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
Economic planning officials said Japan's exports are expected to rise about 7% 
to $305 billion in 1991-92 from $285 billion in 1990-91, while imports are 
expected to swell by about 9.2% to $249 billion from $228 billion. 
</P>
<P>
The government forecast that consumer prices would rise 2.4% in 1991-92 after 
increasing 3.1% this fiscal year. But it said wholesale prices will drop 0.1% 
-- due mainly to the yen's continued strength -- after rising 2% in 1990-91. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is expected to average 2.2% in 1991-92, unchanged from 1990-91. 
The government expects industrial production to rise 4.1% after growing 5.5% 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
The forecasts are based on the assumption that the Gulf crisis will be resolved 
with no major military conflict and that oil prices will average $25 per 
barrel. It also assumes an average dollar/yen exchange rate of 128.10 yen. The 
dollar is currently at around 135 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said domestic demand should remain strong, led by consumer spending 
and corporate capital investment. 
</P>
<P>
The government forecast expects consumer spending to grow by a real 4.1% in 
1991-92 after rising 4.2% this year, while capital spending should increase 
6.8% after growing 11.7%. 
</P>
<P>
But private housing investment, hurt by higher domestic interest rates, will 
likely contract by 2.7% in 1991-92 after rising 8.4% in 1990-91, the forecast 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The government said domestic demand would contribute four percentage points to 
real growth in gross national product during 1991-92, but external demand would 
trim growth by 0.2 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
In the current fiscal year, domestic demand will contribute 5.5 percentage 
points to real growth, while external demand will slow economic expansion by 
0.3 points, the officials said.

JAPANESE FIRMS TRY TO HELP SOVIETS BOLSTER ECONOMY 
</P>

<P>
Japanese businessmen are extending a tentative lifeline to the ailing Soviet 
economy even though their government has avoided wider ties pending resolution 
of a long-standing territorial dispute. 
</P>
<P>
A number of companies have signed contracts or worked behind the scenes to help 
the Soviets in their herculean task of converting to a market-oriented economy. 
</P>
<P>
"If Gorbachev is ousted and perestroika fails, it will be a very big setback, 
so some politicians and corporations have decided they must help it succeed," 
said Hiroshi Kato, a Soviet specialist at Keio University. 
</P>
<P>
Although there has been no breakthrough in a dispute over a group of islands 
north of Japan seized by Moscow at the end of World War II, Soviet President 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev is expected to make a concession on the islands when he 
visits Tokyo next spring. 
</P>
<P>
"If perestroika fails," Kato said, "Japan will have to help with refugees 
fleeing from Siberia. Inflation will become terrible and cause a complete 
economic failure. And then the Japanese will have to pay even more than now to 
bail the Soviets out." 
</P>
<P>
While Japan continues to rule out official financial aid to the Soviets until 
the islands are returned, it is providing some emergency medical relief. 
</P>
<P>
Major Japanese trading houses and banks are among the companies concluding 
deals with the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsubishi Corp., Japan's largest trading house, recently signed a $300-million 
contract to build 18 cargo ships for the Soviet shipping firm Sovcomflot. 
</P>
<P>
Mitsui Busan, another major trading firm, has reached preliminary agreement 
with the Soviet Ministry of Oil and Gas Industry for two offshore oil and 
natural gas projects near the eastern Soviet island of Sakhalin. The project 
will provide the Soviets with offshore oil extraction technology and boost 
Soviet petrochemical exports. 
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, five commercial banks agreed to lend the Soviet Union $400 
million to buy steel pipes and pay for goods already imported from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
Seiji Tsutsumi, head of the Saison Group of retail and travel companies, says 
he and other businessmen are writing a book to help the Soviets follow the 
Japanese example of rebuilding after the war. 
</P>
<P>
The two-year-old Soviet policy of allowing 14,000 enterprises to make their own 
deals with foreign companies without going through the central government has 
bred great confusion. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows who's in charge. In the past, you could depend on the government 
to back up Soviet firms, but now you can't trust the system," said Michitaka 
Hatori, economist at the Japan Assn. for Trade With the Soviet Union and 
Socialist Countries of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet businesses have been told to become self-sufficient because they can no 
longer rely on the state to bail them out. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign creditors have been unwilling to come to the rescue of ailing Soviet 
firms, and as a result some exporters have stopped shipments to the Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
Estimates of unpaid Soviet trade debts to Japan range from several hundred 
million to $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
When Soviet companies sought delays of up to nine months to pay for steel from 
Japan, supplies were cut off until a partial payment was made, Japanese 
officials say. Matsushita Electric Co. started requiring advance payment for 
exports after Soviet buyers fell behind in payments. 
</P>
<P>
Direct trade fell 6.4% in the first nine months of 1990 from the corresponding 
period a year earlier because of such embarrassments.

MARKET BEAT: ADVICE FOR ALL INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here's an easy New Year's resolution: You will invest wisely in 1991, no matter 
how many mistakes you've made before. 
</P>
<P>
With all of the uncertainties facing financial markets -- the recession, the 
Mideast and the debt spiral, to name a few -- it may not be easy to make money 
over the short run. In fact, it may be nearly impossible. So a smarter tactic 
is to improve your chances of long-term success, because that's what really 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
Here, a few suggestions for investors and savers of every stripe: 
</P>
<P>
* Never buy an investment until you've also decided when you'll sell it. Sound 
contrary? It isn't. The classic mistake most investors make is that they fail 
to set goals. That's like starting on a trip without the foggiest idea where 
you're going. Chances are, you'll just end up lost. Before you buy a stock or 
bond investment, including mutual funds, you must answer these questions: How 
long am I willing to hold this? What kind of return do I expect? How much am I 
willing to lose before I decide I've erred? 
</P>
<P>
* Never buy an investment before you've looked at its history. Naturally, 
you're attracted to an investment for its future promise, not for its past. But 
the past can tell you a lot. At the very least, you'll understand what has 
shaped the investment -- and what investors before you earned or lost. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a bond mutual fund may look appealing to you because the yield is 
high. But what's happened to the share price -- the principal value -- over the 
past 10 years? Did it fluctuate wildly? What was the average total return each 
year -- in other words, the percentage return including both interest paid and 
change in principal? And was that return better than what a plain old one-year 
bank CD would have paid each year? 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, with individual stocks, look back as far as you can. Either from the 
company's annual report or from data services such as Value Line or Standard 
&amp; Poor's, track the stock price over time. You may be surprised at how 
steadily a stock has risen -- or how badly it has performed. 
</P>
<P>
* Never buy an investment over the phone. There's a movement in the brokerage 
business to stop unsolicited telephone pitches, but it still goes on. If you 
get a call from a broker trying to sell you something, tell the caller you 
absolutely will not invest that way. Don't be buffaloed. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, you should turn the tables on the broker: Ask him or her if they'd be 
willing to sit down with you and do a complete review of your finances, tax 
situation, retirement plan and other matters. Is the broker certified as a 
financial planner? What would the firm charge for a complete financial review, 
without obligation? Never let yourself be pushed around by a salesperson. If 
the broker is a true professional, that person should put your needs first -- 
beginning with a thorough review of what you own now and what you want to 
achieve in the 1990s. Accept nothing less. 
</P>
<P>
* Divide and conquer: Diversify. Think of your money as a manure pile -- and 
spread it around. That's the best way to raise your investment crop yield over 
time while lowering your risk. If you've just got savings in the bank, spread 
it among CDs of different terms. If you have the wherewithal to invest in 
stocks and bonds, never allow one security to dominate your portfolio. Most 
mutual funds won't let a single security compose more than 5% to 10% of their 
assets. That's a good rule to lower your risk. 
</P>
<P>
As 1991 begins, think about what you don't own, but know you should. Maybe this 
is the year you should move 5% of your portfolio into an international stock 
mutual fund, for the long haul. If you're trying to save for a child's college 
education, this may be a good time to be looking at, say, three well-respected 
growth stock funds. If you need income, look into funds that buy corporate 
bonds of the highest quality. 
</P>
<P>
And if you enjoy playing individual stocks, check out things in your own back 
yard. There are hundreds of Southland stocks that you can invest in. This is a 
great time to call the companies, get their annual reports and begin looking 
for stocks that will shine once the current economic slump ends. 
</P>
<P>
* Involve your spouse in investment decisions. In many marriages, one spouse 
handles the investment portfolio, and the other often doesn't have a clue. 
That's the wrong way to go. Two heads are better than one. Plus, the 
less-knowledgeable spouse often will ask the basic questions that the more 
experienced spouse overlooks -- questions that usually are extremely important, 
including the simple, "Why are we doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
* Don't buy all at once. If you like an investment for the long run, don't 
rush. Buy it over a few months' time, or even longer. If you "average in," 
there's far less chance you'll be buying at the high price. "Averaging" your 
purchases may never be more important than this year, with all the risks -- and 
also opportunities -- inherent in the markets. 
</P>
<P>
Briefly: Reminder to investors who will be making last-minute portfolio changes 
this week: Internal Revenue Service rules say that if you make a trade up 
through the last day of 1990, the gain or loss on the investment counts for the 
1990 tax year, even if the trade settles in 1991. A few years ago, the IRS 
allowed investors to trade in the last five days of the year and choose later 
whether to apply the transaction to the old tax year or the new, since the 
trades would be settled in the new year (it generally takes five days to 
settle). But that choice has since been taken away.

COURTLY LEADER: Central Municipal Court Judge Richard W. Stanford has been 
grabbing headlines by threatening Sheriff Brad Gates with contempt of court for 
releasing inmates early to ease jail overcrowding. . . . But does he have the 
support of his fellow judges? A clue: They unanimously reelected him presiding 
judge of the Central Municipal Court, effective Jan. 1. . . . "I have not done 
any of my actions without consulting" the other judges, Stanford says. "It's a 
collective decision of the court as far as I'm concerned." Gebe Martinez and

STREET SMART: SO A DRIVER'S IN THE RIGHT (LANE), SO WHY STOP TRAFFIC? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
As long as everyone doesn't travel the same direction at the same time of day, 
it will never be possible to please everyone who approaches a traffic signal. 
Nonetheless, there may be some isolated changes that can be made to improve the 
situation at little cost. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestion I would like to propose pertains to two side entrances, or 
T-intersections, at the Meadows and the Groves developments on Jeffrey Road and 
Irvine Boulevard where traffic signals were recently installed. 
</P>
<P>
The exits feature a left-turn lane and a right-turn lane. Each has a wire loop 
embedded in the pavement that tells the signal when a car is waiting to turn 
onto the main road. 
</P>
<P>
Since a vehicle making a right turn onto the main road will have no interaction 
with the far-side lanes on the main road, it appears totally unnecessary for 
traffic on the far side of the main street to be impeded by a red light. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, since right-hand turns are normally permissible on a red light, it 
appears even unnecessary for the light to turn red at all in either direction 
on the main street. 
</P>
<P>
I suggest the signals be controlled to turn red only for those vehicles exiting 
via a left turn onto Jeffrey Road or Irvine Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
David Melvold 
</P>
<P>
Irvine 
</P>
<P>
Yes, these sorts of pipsqueak intersections can evoke a primal scream from even 
the most patient motorist. And this seems a worthy suggestion. But there are 
some solid reasons why you won't be seeing it embraced in Irvine anytime soon. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no wire loop to trip the signal light for motorists making a 
right turn onto the main road, it could potentially put some of those drivers 
in a precarious position, noted Mark Carroll, a principal project engineer for 
Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Left-turning motorists would have no problems, of course. The trouble would be 
with right-turners. Heavy traffic on the main road could make it tough for any 
but the most daring motorist to pull out. It could also lead to a real traffic 
jam on the side entrance if there were more than one or two cars lined up 
trying to turn out into traffic, Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody deserves their fair share," he said. "Let's not penalize the people 
trying to make a right turn. Everyone should take their turn. That's what 
traffic signals are all about." 
</P>
<P>
There is a way the intersections could be modified to ease the situation, but 
it would prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
As these intersections are typically configured, motorists turning right or 
left out of the side entrance follow the commands of a typical round-lensed 
traffic light. But the signal could be changed so that right-turning motorists 
would get a right arrow and left-turners would get a left arrow. 
</P>
<P>
If each arrow acted independently, the signal could be adjusted so that as a 
right-turning motorist waited at the side entrance, only the right arrow would 
be triggered, keeping the left-turn lane red. Under those circumstances, the 
main road's lane nearest the side entrance would get a red light, but the far 
lane could continue unimpeded. 
</P>
<P>
These sorts of signals, unfortunately, are complex and cost quite a bit more 
than the typical sort of signal you now see. So don't look for them anytime 
soon . . . darn it. 
</P>
<P>
Dear Street Smart: 
</P>
<P>
Unless the Department of Motor Vehicles has made a brand-new ruling regarding 
diesel cars, your assertion that all cars have to pass a smog check every other 
year is false. 
</P>
<P>
We sold our diesel Mercedes recently, but I remember filling out the back of 
the license-renewal slip stating that the car was exempt because it was a 
diesel. We passed the requirement every year. 
</P>
<P>
Farie Momayez 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 
</P>
<P>
Hey, this is the kind of situation I love. Believe it or not, we're both right! 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, the state Air Resources Board did not require a smog check for 
diesel passenger cars. But last year, the agency introduced a regulation 
mandating that diesels get an "under-hood" inspection to ensure that they are 
functioning properly. You must have sold your Mercedes in time to avoid the new 
law. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Sessa, an Air Resources Board spokesman, said the new test does not 
involve the sort of tailpipe smog checks that are performed on gasoline-powered 
autos. Such a test has yet to be perfected for diesels. 
</P>
<P>
Sessa noted that diesels don't produce a lot of the gasses that combine to form 
urban smog. What they do produce is particulates, the sooty-looking stuff that 
spews from the tailpipe when the things rev up. 
</P>
<P>
The particulates one can see are not the troublesome types. They generally do 
little more than float to the ground. More worrisome are the microscopic 
particulates that can be inhaled and prove caustic to lung tissue, Sessa said. 
</P>
<P>
While an occasional diesel can still be spotted on the road, California 
recently approved tough laws that rein in the emissions from such vehicles, 
Sessa said. Since then, manufacturers have been either unwilling or unable to 
devise models that meet the new standards. As a result, no new diesel cars have 
been sold in California in the past two years, Sessa said. 
</P>
<P>
As for those diesels still on the road, the Air Resources Board has taken steps 
to clean up the fuel they burn. New regulations on the quality of diesel 
refined and sold in California have resulted in a reduction in the sulfur and 
other gook released when the fuel is burned by cars, Sessa said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the agency plans to begin roadside inspections of diesel trucks 
and busses next spring in an effort to clean up those vehicles. 
</P>

MALL RUSH CENTERED IN PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Painfully aware that time is running out, anxious Christmas shoppers descended 
on area shopping malls Sunday, where they raced for parking spaces but paused 
before taking out their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
By many merchants' accounts, it was only a moderate shopping day compared to 
Dec. 23 in years past -- a reflection of the jump in oil prices and national 
fears of a recession. "This is the slowest we've been in a long time. It's 
absolutely crazy," said Grant Breding, a salesclerk at The Metropolitan Museum 
of Art New York located in South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
The exception to the rule at South Coast Plaza and MainPlace/Santa Ana appeared 
to be toy stores, which were jammed with children making additions to their 
wish lists as well as mothers, fathers, uncles and grandmothers all trying to 
figure out what to buy. 
</P>
<P>
For some, there were just too many choices. The popular Baby Alive -- a doll 
that eats, drinks and wets. Train sets. Educational puzzles. 
</P>
<P>
Rod Beard, 31, knelt in front of several packages of pink beauty kits, each 
equipped with fingernail polish, miniature hairbrushes, curlers and other 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just trying to figure out how to divide these up between my niece and my 
kids," said the Fullerton resident and father of two girls, 1 and 2. "I've got 
a yard of gum here too and that should do it. I think. I hope." 
</P>
<P>
At another toy store at Main Place, Tyler Martin, a 12-year-old from Irvine, 
lamented the cost of Legos and other toys. 
</P>
<P>
"The littlest things are so expensive," he said. "This little itty bitty box is 
$17," he said, holding up Space Police, a Legos set. "It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
Another popular spot for adults was Victoria's Secret, where husbands and 
boyfriends hoped to find a gift for their beloved two days before Christmas. 
</P>

"Do you know what size?" Myhowich asked helpfully. The customer, however, shook

CITY GIVES PRIORITY TO DOWNTOWN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When the brick wall of a 75-year-old downtown building developed a troubling 
bulge this month, it illustrated what many city officials and residents have 
been saying about the area. 
</P>
<P>
After two decades of painstaking planning, the city must finally face the task 
of deciding how and when it will complete its downtown redevelopment project, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
The unexpected swell that suddenly appeared Dec. 9 on the side of Jack's 
Surfboards, Main Street and Pacific Coast Highway, prompted the evacuation of 
the shop and its top-story apartments for an indefinite period. Like many 
structures in the aging neighborhood, the building's badly needed renovations 
have long been on hold as future development proposals are mulled and 
scrutinized. 
</P>
<P>
Now, eight years and dozens of scrapped proposals after the council approved 
the original master plan for the downtown area, the new council has targeted 
the redevelopment project as its priority for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
During the council's first meeting since the election of three new council 
members and selection of Peter M. Green as mayor, it adopted a detailed 
schedule for developing a definitive new downtown plan within the next months. 
</P>
<P>
City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga, who is nearing the end of his first 
year at the job, has also strongly recommended that an updated, detailed plan 
for the area be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for us to get moving on this," said Councilman Jack Kelly, 
who served on the council from 1980 to 1988 before returning this month. "We do 
not have a conceptual plan or anything else on paper to look at and say yes or 
no to." 
</P>
<P>
The council has planned a series of meetings among city officials, developers 
and residents during the new year. The council hopes to approve the new 
redevelopment project by April 1, which could be in place by June if adopted by 
the California Coastal Commission, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
To date, the 336-acre downtown redevelopment plan has been riddled with delays 
and glitches, has sharply divided the community and has satisfied no one. 
</P>
<P>
The original concept for the area, which was enacted in 1982 and included 
towering condominium complexes and hotels, is moot. 
</P>
<P>
"Until about a month ago, the city's plans for downtown have basically been 
running amok," said Douglas Langevin, a downtown property owner and one of 
those leading critics. But with council members and city planners retraining 
their sights on developing the downtown area, redevelopment advocates and 
opponents alike are hopeful about the prospects. 
</P>
<P>
The first step in honing the new plan will be to clearly define the "village 
concept" that the council three years ago agreed the area should reflect. 
</P>
<P>
Council members and other city officials differ widely on their interpretations 
of the concept. Some say it entails a quaint, low-density housing and small 
shops, while others believe it suggests a bustling, high-rise, Westwood-style 
retail hub. 
</P>
<P>
First in line among the planned projects is the critical, second phase of the 
Main-Pier project: a two-block area of 1920s-era apartments and shops, 
including Jack's Surfboards, bound by Pacific Coast Highway, Walnut Avenue and 
6th and Main streets. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now, that area looks like a slum," Mayor Pro Tem Jim Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the obstacles, Green said he is confident that this council can finally 
reinvigorate the stagnant downtown effort. 
</P>
<P>
"And now is as good a time as any . . . to look critically at each individual 
project and develop a solid, working plan for the entire area." JOHN PENNER

PLANNERS APPROVE SIGN ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MESSINA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The city's first comprehensive sign ordinance was approved by the Planning 
Commission and will be sent to the City Council for final approval next month. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, merchants and city planners had been working from guidelines set by 
the county and planned community documents, according to Community Development 
Director Clint Sherrod. 
</P>
<P>
"A merchant can now just come to the counter (at City Hall) and see what the 
requirements are," all in one document, Sherrod said. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioners approved the ordinance 4 to 0. Commissioner Joseph Lowe was 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
The sign law establishes architectural standards, including height and overall 
size. 
</P>
<P>
The ordinance was ready to be sent to the council last June but was delayed by 
the passage of a state law preventing municipalities from banning real estate 
signs, such as those on private property giving directions to an open house. 
</P>
<P>
City planners revised the Mission Viejo ordinance to reflect the state law that 
takes effect Jan. 1. FRANK MESSINA

PLAY AREA APPROVED FOR JEFFREY-LYNNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Children living in Anaheim's Jeffrey-Lynne area behind Disneyland will soon 
have a new place to play, ending years of hazardous street recreation in the 
tiny, crowded neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Just this month, a child playing in the streets was hit by a car, and although 
he was not harmed, the accident renewed pleas from the community for a safer 
play area. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real close to home for a lot of parents -- the need for a park," said 
Anita Castro-Zvoda, director of the neighborhood's community center. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, city officials approved a long-delayed plan to close off one 
of the neighborhood streets to traffic and convert it into a play area. 
</P>
<P>
Audre Drive, between Jeffrey and Hampstead streets, will be limited to 
pedestrian traffic. Play equipment and shrubbery will replace asphalt. 
</P>
<P>
Construction, scheduled to begin in February, will take less than a month, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Residents who attended a neighborhood meeting last week voiced concerns about 
the safety of the park in the neighborhood, which was once a haven for drug 
dealers and gang members. 
</P>
<P>
Residents said they were also concerned about losing parking spaces on Audre 
Drive, once it becomes a park. Many families renting apartments in the densely 
populated neighborhood said their landlords charge them rent to park in the 
apartment garages, and rather than pay the additional fees, they park in the 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The reality is we're going to lose some parking places, and there's going to 
be some obvious parking problems," said Castro-Zvoda. She said she hopes to 
work with the landlords to make the garages more affordable for the residents. 
</P>
<P>
The play area on Audre Drive has been a dream since residents first organized 
and began lobbying the city to help take better care of their neighborhood a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The park will not be grassy when first constructed but will include potted 
trees and play equipment such as swings. It may also include a temporary 
community center. 
</P>
<P>
If the first, one-year phase of the park is successful, without problems due to 
parking or a return of gang or drug activity, the city will close the street, 
plant grass and build a permanent community center.LISA MASCARO

FUNDS SOUGHT FOR ROAD IMPROVEMENTS 
</P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The City Council has approved a request for nearly $300,000 in county matching 
grant funds to improve El Camino Real, the main street linking the north and 
south ends of the city. 
</P>
<P>
Plans call for repaving the north end of the four-lane street from Avenida 
Mateo to El Portal, with the city paying for half of the project, estimated to 
cost $594,000. 
</P>
<P>
The council also approved a separate request for county matching funds to 
repave Avenida Pico, between Calle de Los Molinos and Calle Frontera, a heavily 
traveled area from the freeway to San Clemente High School. 
</P>
<P>
If county officials agree, the city would pay $475,000 toward the project from 
its share of state gasoline tax revenue. The rest of the money would come from 
the county's Arterial Highway Financing Program. WENDY PAULSON

GIRLS' SOCCER: AFTER A SEASON OF TURMOIL IN 1989, LYNN MURRAY, THE AZTECS' ONLY

<P>
Last season, the Esperanza High School girls' soccer team had a group of 
talented players who didn't like each other much. 
</P>
<P>
Egos and tempers flared. Grudges were nurtured. Disputes unrelated to soccer 
were carried onto the field, and players involved in the disputes withheld 
passes to each other from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
It got so bad that after the season the players held three elections to 
determine which players' honors would be awarded. 
</P>
<P>
It was a fitting conclusion to a season that ended before anyone's 
expectations. Ranked No. 1 in the Southern Section Division 4-A for most of the 
season, Esperanza lost to Royal, 2-1, in the quarterfinals of the divisional 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
With the lessons of last year in mind, Lynn Murray, Esperanza's only returning 
starter, has taken control of a young team and stepped forward to become one of 
the most prolific scorers in Orange County and Division 4-A. 
</P>
<P>
"It just fell apart last year," Murray said. "Eventually, we got it back 
together but, by that time, it was just too late and that's a shame. We should 
have done it two years in a row with that team because we had a lot of talent." 
</P>
<P>
Esperanza might not have as many talented players as it did last year, Coach 
John Coppage said, but it's a better team. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, the majority of the team last year was playing for itself," he 
said. "Lynn was one of the few who was playing for the team. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nowhere near the individual talent we had last year, but they are a 
better team and she makes them that. She's the catalyst to take a lot of young 
players and make them think they are better than they are. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't get me wrong, we have five or six really good players but last year we 
had 13 great players." 
</P>
<P>
Murray, a two-time first-team all-division forward, has 18 goals in 10 games 
for Esperanza (9-0-1). The Aztecs, ranked No. 5 in the Division 4-A preseason 
coaches' poll, will play No. 1 El Toro for the championship of the Cerritos 
tournament at 7 p.m. Wednesday at Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
Although she led Esperanza in scoring with 23 goals her sophomore year and was 
second last season (18), this is the first year Murray isn't sharing the 
spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
In each of her first two seasons on the varsity, Esperanza made it to the 
championship game of the divisional playoffs. The Aztecs have a 79-5-7 record 
since Murray has been on the team. 
</P>
<P>
Murray, who scored six goals in a reserve role as a freshman, immediately 
contributed because of her speed. She also runs for the Esperanza track and 
field team and last spring anchored the 1,600-meter relay team to the fastest 
time in Orange County and fifth-fastest in the state. Currently, she is 
pondering whether she would like to run track in college. She has no doubts 
about playing soccer in college and Coppage said he is certain she will be a 
great Division I player. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of times you'll find players with great speed and that's all they have," 
Coppage said. "She's not as quick as she was as a ninth-grader, but she's 
without a doubt the best forward in the county and possibly the Southern 
Section." 
</P>
<P>
Coppage said Murray, who also leads the team with 13 assists, has been patient 
with teammates who are still learning. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't stand around with her hands on her hips wondering why they can't 
play up to her expectations," Coppage said. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the team's captain, Murray said she has had to let loose on the 
field when someone isn't playing her best. 
</P>
<P>
"I tend to get really tense when I'm on the field," Murray said. "I'm always 
yelling, telling people to do things." 
</P>
<P>
But she makes certain no feelings are hurt, explaining after the game that her 
exhortations are meant to help teammates play better. 
</P>
<P>
"It never gets to the point where people stop what they're doing and yell at 
each other," she said. "And often that did happen last year."

<P>
Saturday's Freedom Bowl matches up Oregon's Quack Attack and Colorado State's 
Battering Rams. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing the teams' offenses have in common are their colors -- 
green and gold -- right? 
</P>
<P>
After all, Oregon passes every chance it gets, the better to show off 
quarterback Bill Musgrave and a stable of speedy receivers. 
</P>
<P>
And Colorado State runs the ball down its opponents' throats with fullback Todd 
Yert and tailbacks Tony Alford and Brain Copeland. 
</P>
<P>
That's the perception many people have, but both teams feature balanced 
offenses. At least that's what a comparison of the statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon has a slight advantage in passing, averaging 229.3 yards to Colorado 
State's 192.9. Colorado State runs more often, averaging 219.3 yards to 
Oregon's 151.5. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave has passed for 2,219 yards and 14 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State quarterbacks Kevin Verdugo and Mike Gimenez have passed for 
2,256 yards and 12 touchdowns combined. 
</P>
<P>
Copeland, the Rams' leading rusher, gained 945 yards. Sean Burwell, the Ducks' 
leading rusher, gained 949 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Musgrave's hopes of a Rhodes Scholarship ended when he was not granted an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
On the advice of an Oregon faculty member, Musgrave applied for the prestigious 
postgraduate scholarship to England's Oxford University. The paperwork was 
filed and the final step would have been an interview. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon injuries: Peter Brantley, an all-conference linebacker, suffered a 
moderate knee strain during Saturday's practice. He did not practice Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
It is not known whether Brantley, a starter for 22 consecutive games, will play 
against Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell, a redshirt freshman tailback, practiced at full speed Saturday for the 
first time since injuring his lower back Nov. 17 in the Ducks' 6-3 victory over 
Oregon State. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell's 949 rushing yards were the fourth-best in the Pacific 10 Conference, 
and he was the nation's top freshman in all-purpose yards with a 139.9-yard 
average. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket update: The Oregon ticket office has sold 17,500 tickets, the most by 
one Freedom Bowl school. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Orange County Sports Assn. presented Oregon Athletic Director 
Bill Byrne with the "Babe Ruth" award. 
</P>
<P>
"For calling his shot," said Don Anderson, Freedom Bowl executive director. "He 
said Oregon would sell 15,000 tickets when we extended the invitation and he 
delivered." 
</P>
<P>
Colorado State has sold 7,000 tickets in Ft. Collins, according to school 
officials.

REGULATORS REWRITE RULES, FLEX MUSCLES OVER S&amp;LS, BANKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For banks and thrifts, 1990 has been a year of renewed regulation. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County and throughout the nation, federal banking and thrift 
regulators used a stiff, wide broom to sweep away anything remotely resembling 
trouble at the institutions they examined. 
</P>
<P>
Empowered by the 1989 federal law -- the Financial Institutions Reform, 
Recovery and Enforcement Act -- that restructured the thrift industry, 
beefed-up federal agencies have been scrutinizing bank and savings and loan 
assets as never before. 
</P>
<P>
The current economic downturn -- a recession in many regions -- has increased 
the pressure, as regulators have insisted on ever bigger write-downs in the 
value of loans, securities and other assets held by banks and S&amp;Ls. 
</P>
<P>
And regulators are still rewriting the rules. Less than a year after the 
restructuring law mandated three strict capital tests, regulators are raising 
the level of one of those tests. The changes will continue into 1991. 
</P>
<P>
It is a decimated thrift industry and a shaky independent banking industry, 
both of which have had difficulty raising needed capital, that must grapple 
with the change. There is certain to be more failures, putting more pressure on 
the federal deposit insurance fund. 
</P>
<P>
"They're still writing rules for the Charles Keatings of the world, and they've 
got most of them locked up already," said James P. Giraldin, president of 
Irvine City Bank, an S&amp;L. "Why isn't the government adding strength to the 
industry instead of sapping it?" 
</P>
<P>
The pendulum has swung far since the days of deregulation that spawned a host 
of high-flying thrift owners like Keating. His Irvine-based Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan expanded rapidly in the mid-1980s as he took advantage of expanded 
powers to put depositors' money to work on desert land in Arizona, junk bonds 
and other highly risky ventures. But the thrift failed in 1989, and this year 
Keating was indicted on charges of state securities fraud. Lincoln is expected 
to cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln was not alone and the industry's cleanup is likely to cost more than 
$500 billion over the next 40 years. So it is little wonder that regulators are 
using their new powers to flex their muscles as never before. 
</P>
<P>
They are poring over loan files, checking to see that each loan is properly 
documented. 
</P>
<P>
They are reviewing appraisal reports for real estate and other assets, and they 
are questioning how institutions account for the value of their assets, often 
requiring that some assets be marked to their current value regardless of 
whether those assets are for sale now. And they have come down hard on thrifts 
especially. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been subjected to a full-fledged regulatory transformation," said 
Fredric J. Forster, president and chief executive of ITT Federal Bank, an 
Irvine thrift. "There has been so much fear instilled into the system, with 
tougher capital requirements and much tougher write-down requirements, that 
it's causing the thrift industry to have cardiac arrest." 
</P>
<P>
Orders to write down the values of assets, he said, can set off a chain 
reaction resulting in an institution's nose-dive. Write-downs can wipe out 
earnings first and then capital, leaving institutions on the doorsteps of 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
On the banking side, closer scrutiny by regulators is only one aspect of the 
year-old federal law and the heightened awareness of troubles at financial 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole general attitude of the public and the regulators and the 
politicians has affected us more than anything else," said Clyde H. Gossert, 
president and chief executive of CommerceBank in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The negative attitude, he said, has led to deflated prices for bank stocks, 
which in turn makes it more difficult for banks to sell new stock and raise 
capital to make themselves stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Fear of what regulators might do is so pervasive that bankers often engage in 
harsh self-regulation, refusing to make commercial construction loans, for 
instance, that might be criticized by federal agents, said Richard Boyle, 
president of Pioneer Bank in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
But Boyle said that although regulators are tough, they won't block loans that 
make financial sense. "My guess is that a lot of bankers use regulators as an 
excuse for not making certain kinds of loans," Boyle said. "But regulators 
won't stop you from making good loans." 
</P>
<P>
Top officials at federal agencies have been trying to reassure bank and thrift 
executives that regulators don't want to overreact and prevent lenders from 
making quality loans, said Stephen W. Prough, president of Western Financial 
Savings Bank in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the tougher regulatory climate has played havoc with bank and thrift 
financial statements. Most S&amp;Ls have been limiting their growth and, in 
some cases, selling off assets as they try to shore up capital to comply with 
new rules. 
</P>
<P>
More than 200 thrifts nationwide failed the three strict tests and fell into 
the hands of the federal government after the law was passed. And soon the test 
will get tougher. One standard now requiring a 3% ratio of capital to assets is 
being raised to 4%. 
</P>
<P>
Bankers, fearing the fate that befell the thrifts, aren't stepping in as they 
might to pick up the slack in home lending. And there aren't many other places 
for them to put their money, either. 
</P>
<P>
"When you see the flags flying, you've got to pay attention," said William J. 
Mylymok, president of Sunwest Bank in Tustin. Besides facing a soft real estate 
market, bankers see unemployment creeping up and consumer spending going down, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gerry Findley, a Brea-based financial institutions consultant, said bankers are 
being pressured subtly by regulators to put their money into government 
securities. Such bonds are about the only assets that regulators aren't 
criticizing. 
</P>
<P>
"The demand for loans has not been strong," he said. "And there's been a shift 
of funding sources for consumer loans, like automobile loans, to non-bank 
lenders." 
</P>
<P>
Yet banks have been picking up billions of dollars in deposits this year by 
buying failed thrifts, and the only place the money can go quickly is into 
federal securities, he said. 
</P>
<P>
By the time annual statistics are compiled early next year, Findley expects to 
see a drop in total assets among thrifts statewide and only a slight growth -- 
about 5% -- in the size of the state's banking industry, which grew 16% the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, banks are generally solid and are expected to remain 
profitable, he said, but local S&amp;Ls may be prevented from posting their 
first combined profit in years because of huge losses at Lincoln and FarWest 
Savings in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
The local thrift picture is improving if only because regulators sold four 
thrifts that failed this year and two that failed previously. 
</P>
<P>
Lincoln is the only failed local thrift in government hands that is still 
operating and still for sale. FarWest, though insolvent, has not been seized. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in three years, a county-based bank was closed by 
regulators, bringing to 11 the number of banks that have collapsed in the last 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
Far Western Bank in Tustin, which invested nearly all of its assets in 
low-quality automobile loans, was closed Dec. 14. 
</P>
<P>
The four Orange County S&amp;Ls that failed this year bring to 19 the number of 
county-based thrifts that have collapsed in the last six years. No county in 
the state has seen more of its thrifts fail. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, the public image of financial institutions nationwide took a 
beating at the hands of nearly everyone from comic Jay Leno to President Bush. 
</P>
<P>
The President launched a special prosecution unit to tackle fraud in financial 
institutions, even while his son was being investigated for possible wrongdoing 
at a Denver thrift. 
</P>
<P>
The FBI identified four failed Orange County thrifts -- Lincoln, Mercury, 
Consolidated Savings and American Diversified Savings -- as part of the 
nation's 20 top-priority criminal investigations of thrifts. 
</P>
<P>
And several thrift executives were convicted of fraud and sent to prison. More 
indictments and trials are expected next year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Year in Review / BANKS AND S&amp;Ls UNDER PRESSURE 
</P>
<P>
Audits, Scandal and Insolvency 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, many banks found it difficult to make good-quality loans. Most savings 
and loans were trimming loan portfolios. Now, loan demand is down, and both 
banks and S&amp;Ls are looking for other places to invest their deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Audit Issues 
</P>
<P>
Facing tougher laws and new regulations, banks and S&amp;Ls saw increased 
scrutiny in regulatory examinations this year. Among the major issues addressed 
in audits of financial institutions this year were: 
</P>
<P>
* Forced write-downs in the value of loans, real estate investments, junk bonds 
and other assets to reflect current sale value rather than long-term market 
value. 
</P>
<P>
* Severe limits on the amount of loans S&amp;Ls could make to one borrower. 
</P>
<P>
* Increased costs of federal audits and federal deposit insurance. 
</P>
<P>
* Closer scrutiny of appraisals on real estate and other assets and collateral. 
</P>
<P>
* More criticism of certain types of loans, especially construction loans for 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
* A likely increase in the amount of capital required of S&amp;Ls to meet one 
of three strict capital standards.

Financial Figures in the News 
</P>
<P>
* Charles H. Keating Jr., former owner of failed Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in 
Irvine, was indicted with three associates on 46 counts of securities fraud in 
connection with the sale of $200 million in bonds. 
</P>
<P>
* Leonard Shane, former chairman of Mercury Savings &amp; Loan in Huntington 
Beach, was given an honorary doctorate for his philanthropic donations just a 
month before his thrift failed because of changes in accounting rules and bad 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
* Frank J. Mola, an Orange County developer, walked away from his multimillion 
investment in Charter Savings Bank in Newport Beach when the institution fell 
into insolvency. Charter's problems stemmed from the purchase of a failed 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
* William Belzberg, chairman of the company that owns FarWest Savings in 
Newport Beach, has -- with two brothers -- resisted investing more money into 
the insolvent institution, making it a likely candidate for a federal takeover.

ANN CONWAY: CELEBRATING THE FAMILY;

<P>
TIME TOGETHER SEEMS TO BE THE MOST COVETED GIFT OF ALL

<P>
There'll be no racing into the living room on Christmas morning for the Kemp 
family of Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition dictates that everyone lines up, youngest to oldest, at the door 
before taking a mad dash at the presents stacked under the tree. That's the 
Kemps' way of protecting their young, even though each of the little ones -- 
never the adults! -- gets to open a gift on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
And tradition ensures that Betty Kemp will whip lasagna out of the freezer this 
morning and serve it up with a tossed salad and garlic bread tonight. Turkey 
and the trimmings are reserved for Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"Lasagna is something I can cook up and freeze ahead of time," explains Betty, 
wife of Tom Kemp (brother of Jack Kemp, U.S. secretary of housing and urban 
development). "We always have it -- makes life much easier." 
</P>
<P>
As always, there'll be ice cream for dessert tonight, along with carols played 
on the piano by the Kemps' daughter, Anne Hummel, and a theatrical reading of 
"The Night Before Christmas" by her husband, Rob. ("He used to be a radio 
announcer in St. Louis," Betty says. "Wonderful voice.") Before the evening 
ends, Tom Kemp Jr. will have engaged his grandmother, Fern Benson, in a serious 
game of Scrabble. And, providing one of his grandchildren doesn't want to take 
a stab at it, Tom Kemp will say grace. 
</P>
<P>
So go the holiday traditions of one of Orange County's leading families. "Of 
course, the most traditional thing of all is that we're together," Betty says. 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy Bendetti of Emerald Bay agrees. "Our family wouldn't miss Christmas 
Eve," says the woman who arranged the social whirl that surrounded the opening 
of the Nixon Library in Yorba Linda. "A son is coming all the way from 
Vancouver. For us, it's so special no one would miss it for the world." 
</P>
<P>
Dorothy and Donald Bendetti's celebration begins with salmon and champagne and 
a family gift exchange. 
</P>
<P>
"We all sit around and open gifts and it's bedlam," says Dorothy. Afterward, 
the family dines formally on prime rib and the trimmings. "Turkey is reserved 
for Christmas Day," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Before bedtime, Donald whips up his scrumptious Tom and Jerry drinks. "And 
then, we'll all retire. We have to get up early for church," Dorothy says. 
</P>
<P>
One of Dorothy's favorite traditions is the way she trims her tree. "I put all 
of the homemade ornaments at the bottom so the little ones can touch them and 
learn about them. And I put the fancy ones at the top of the tree." 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas morning, Donald starts a "big fire in the fireplace," she says. 
"And we all sit together and have coffee and muffins while we open our 
Christmas stockings." 
</P>

The most traditional thing about Mary and James Roosevelt's Christmas Eve is 
that they celebrate it two days early. 
</P>
<P>
"I always do Christmas on Dec. 22," Mary says, "because I hate to cook on 
Christmas Day." 
</P>
<P>
It all started years ago when Mary traveled a lot as a young career woman. "I 
would come back to England for Christmas and our family would stay in a 
wonderful old inn in the heart of the English countryside," she says. There, 
she would dine on grand hotel fare. 
</P>
<P>
"When Jim and I got married, the last thing I wanted to do on Christmas was 
grow up," she says, laughing. "I'd never cooked a turkey, so I just skated 
around it. I've always been entertained on Christmas Day." 
</P>
<P>
But on Dec. 22, Mary -- who has long since learned the art of bird roasting -- 
pulls out the stops for Jim and their daughter, Becky. "I do a turkey dinner 
right down to Christmas pudding with hard sauce," she says. On Christmas, the 
Roosevelts will step out. "We're having dinner with our good friends, Barbara 
and Bill Ficker," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Leaving town for the holidays is becoming traditional for UC Irvine Chancellor 
Jack Peltason and his wife, Suzanne. The couple plan to be with their two 
daughters and three of their grandchildren in St. Louis on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
"We've visited our daughter there for the last three years," says Suzanne. 
</P>
<P>
The night before Christmas, the Peltasons will dine on ham with their family 
and then go to church. "We love a Christmas Eve service," Suzanne says. Jack 
Peltason calls the celebration with his loved ones, "a quiet and wonderful time 
that gives significance to the rest of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Former astronaut Buzz Aldrin and his wife, Lois, hole up in their Sun Valley 
condo on Christmas Eve to watch the torch parade on the snow-covered slopes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely gorgeous," says Lois. "Skiers race down the mountain holding 
flaming torches. And there are beautiful fireworks. It's Sun Valley's way of 
heralding the birth of Christ." 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day, the couple will ski. "It's a big deal -- tradition in the 
valley to ski on Christmas," says Lois, adding that billionaire Donald Bren "is 
always on Sun Valley's slopes that day." 
</P>
<P>
For Orange County Supervisor Thomas F. Riley and his wife, Emma Jane, Christmas 
Eve marks a tradition more than 50 years old. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to midnight Mass and then we have a chicken-salad supper before opening 
our presents," Emma Jane says. "That's an old Riley family tradition. 
</P>
<P>
She loved the tradition from the start, Emma Jane says. "I was studying voice 
when I met Tom and I loved singing at midnight Mass. I have a particular 
sentiment attached to it because one Christmas Eve I was lucky enough to sing 
for the troops at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. It was the Christmas before World War 
II was declared. I'll never forget singing 'O Holy Night' with a Marine officer 
who had one of the most beautiful voices you've ever heard."

FAST ACTION REQUIRED TO LIFT STAINS FROM DELICATE LINEN; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAYS: CLEANING HEIRLOOM CLOTHS IS NOT A PROJECT FOR THE DO-IT-YOURSELFER, 
BUT SOME PRECAUTIONS CAN HELP MINIMIZE THE DAMAGE. 
</P>

When you bring out those heirloom linen tablecloths and napkins for holiday 
entertaining, be sure to watch out for such hazards as melted candle wax, 
spilled wine and grease, and damage to delicate cutwork. 
</P>
<P>
"When you have an accident, except for wine spills, less is more," advises Liz 
Barbatelli of Linens Limited, a national specialized laundry care service. 
"Most of the time, too many operations and cleaning agents are tried in the 
home, which only make the situation more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
A survey done by the company indicated that the holidays are the No. 1 period 
for linen usage, with 71.4% of the respondents saying they always use fine 
linens for the Christmas and Hanukkah holidays, and 80.4% saying they use fine 
linens frequently during this time. 
</P>
<P>
Of those polled, 68.4% said they always use fine table linens for Thanksgiving 
and 76.8% said they use them frequently or always. 
</P>
<P>
Although cleaning stains from fine linens is not a project for the 
do-it-yourselfer, Barbatelli offers the following precautions for linen owners 
should damage occur: 
</P>
<P>
* Candle wax. Allow it to harden. Do not scrape, as this will damage the 
fabric. Dyes in some candle wax will penetrate and stain the fibers. Both can 
be removed only through professional laundering because the chemicals required 
to remove stains and wax are available only to commercial operations. Water 
will not stop the stain action. 
</P>
<P>
* Spilled wine. Soak tablecloths or napkins immediately in cold water; this 
releases the stain so it will not set. Have the linen professionally laundered 
as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
* Grease. This is the toughest of all stains so don't try to treat it at home. 
Grease-stained fabric must be handled by trained professionals and the 
procedure involves boiling the fabric in copper kettles. 
</P>
<P>
* Damaged cutwork. Items such as tablecloths, napkins and runners with cutwork 
usually are family heirlooms and may require professional repair and 
restoration. Remove any damaged items immediately to avoid additional tearing. 
</P>
<P>
"Linens require care and cleaning unlike any other fabric -- hand care, 
stretching, blocking and air drying all preserve the fibers and restore the 
fabric's original size, shape and beauty," said Barbatelli. 
</P>
<P>
"Providing linens the proper care as soon as possible is the best hedge against 
permanent stains and damage."

MANY WHO LOOK TO DATE END UP MEETING WITH OBSTACLES 
</P>

Wanting to meet someone doesn't make it happen, as war-scarred daters will tell 
you. Obstacles ranging from age to long working hours, fear of crime and 
geography keep singles away from parties, gatherings of family and friends, 
cultural events and other common avenues of socialization. 
</P>
<P>
For many, leisure time has decreased, according to Joe Collins, a founder of 
Special Times, a date planning service. What daters say bears him out. 
</P>
<P>
"It is more difficult to meet people. People are working more, and suddenly 
they are wanting family and some balance to life," says Kurt Morrow, co-owner 
of the Baltimore-Washington franchise of the Great Expectations video dating 
service. 
</P>
<P>
Among those who find dating more difficult are people who work long or odd 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Carroll, operations manager for Metro Traffic Control, has a work schedule 
that leaves him little time for sleep, let alone going out. 
</P>
<P>
"I get up at 3:30 a.m. and work at least 12 hours, getting home anywhere from 4 
to 8 p.m.," Carroll says. "Work has forced me to not actively pursue dating as 
I would if I didn't have a crazy work schedule." 
</P>
<P>
Karen Harris, an office manager, works from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and her fiance 
works from 1:30 to 10 p.m. for the U.S. Postal Service, Tuesday through 
Saturday. They snatch evening hours to see each other and reserve Sunday for 
going to church and other quiet, relaxing activities. Monday night is the only 
"date" night for dinner or movies. 
</P>
<P>
Young singles may complain about the pressures of work, but many older singles 
feel isolation brought on by their years away from the dating scene. Middle-age 
and elderly people are often swept off balance after divorce or the death of a 
spouse. By the time they work up the courage to think about dating, the 
prospect looks insurmountable. Women outlive men, generally, so most senior 
singles events are dominated by females. Such women also find that the men in 
their age group often want to date younger women. 
</P>
<P>
Julia Miller, a 68-year-old widowed grandmother, found Pikesville Senior Center 
a place she enjoyed volunteering, meeting friends, and ultimately her new 
husband, Irvin, 75. 
</P>
<P>
They met when he approached her in the sewing room and asked her to mend his 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
"I usually don't fix anything for men, but I said to myself, well, he looks 
good to me," Miller says. "I fixed his shirt and he invited me to breakfast at 
Big Boy's. He kept coming back to the sewing room and asking me out, over and 
over. It took about six weeks, and the romance started." 
</P>
<P>
Another obstacle to dating is the fear of crime. Incoming college freshmen 
women around the nation are routinely warned about the problem of date rape. 
Overall, violent crime against women is reportedly up 50% in the past decade. 
One reason for the increase is more women are reporting such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary," a 45-year-old divorcee, always arranged to meet the men she was sent by 
a computer dating service in a busy, well-lit bar in a suburban hotel. She 
drove herself to the dates and never stepped into a man's car or allowed him in 
her house. Her caution arose after a friend was almost assaulted by a man she 
met through a magazine's personal ad. 
</P>
<P>
While using a computer dating service, Mary was keenly aware of her need to 
protect herself while dating strangers. 
</P>
<P>
Worries about crime aside, Mary was disappointed with the computer dating 
service, which led to a series of mishaps that makes her laugh now. The 
computer dates the service sent -- a succession of meter readers, plumbers, 
janitors and other blue-collar men -- were resentful of her status as a 
stockbroker, she says. "Tell them you are a secretary," the dating service 
advised Mary. And although she had asked for someone within five years of her 
age, all of the dates looked to be her father's age. The exception was a Tom 
Selleck look-alike, who was instantly disqualified when he wanted to go to bed 
on their first date -- despite the fact she had pneumonia. Mary saw 15 men over 
a year's time and not one worked out. 
</P>
<P>
"The men I met were nice people, I just knew they weren't somebody I could 
spend the rest of my life with, or even another hour," Mary says. "They were 
sweaty -- desperate. They all wanted to get married again immediately, to find 
a caretaker." 
</P>
<P>
She has since retired from actively looking for dates. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you are over 40 it's really difficult to meet somebody. You have 
friends and families and that's enough. . . . My life without men is fairly 
comfortable, though it's not exciting."

RUSHDIE MOVES TO SUPPRESS 'SATANIC VERSES'

Author Salman Rushdie has given up his campaign for a paperback version of "The 
Satanic Verses" and will authorize no further translations so long as there is 
any possibility of causing offense to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
An Islamic leader in Britain who met with Rushdie said today the author hopes 
the statement will "make him a free man" after living in hiding for nearly two 
years under a death threat. 
</P>
<P>
In a statement released by Dr. Hesham Essawy, president of the Islamic Society 
for the Promotion of Religious Tolerance, Rushdie also declared he does not 
agree with any statements uttered by characters in the book that cast 
aspersions on Islam, question the authenticity of the Koran or reject the 
divinity of Allah. 
</P>
<P>
"I talked to Salman a couple of minutes ago. That is his statement, and he 
signed it," said Frances D'Souza, who is chairman of Rushdie's defense 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
Without a paperback, Rushdie said in an interview with the Independent on 
Sunday newspaper, "in a few years the book simply won't be there for anyone who 
wants to read it. It will, in all practical terms, have been suppressed." 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie has been in hiding under police guard since February, 1989, when 
now-deceased Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini said the writer 
deserved death as a blasphemer. Iran offered a $1-million bounty for Rushdie's 
death.

The state Supreme Court today upheld most of Proposition 115, the so-called 
"Speedy Trial" initiative, but struck down its broadest provision, a repeal of 
independent state constitutional rights for criminal defendants. 
</P>
<P>
One effect of the ruling is to eliminate a restriction on privacy rights that 
opponents said could be used to allow criminal prosecutions for certain 
abortions. 
</P>
<P>
The court ruled unanimously that the constitutional provision, which would have 
required California courts to follow U.S. Supreme Court rulings in applying a 
long list of constitutional rights, was such a fundamental change that it 
amounted to a "revision" of the state Constitution, which cannot be done by 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
But the court voted 6 to 1 to uphold the rest of the measure, which was passed 
by voters in June.

A 13-year-old girl was recovering today from bullet wounds sustained on a 
Brooklyn street when a masked gunman opened fire on her and two friends because 
he wanted their nylon jackets, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The violence brought to 10 the number of people shot over a coat in the New 
York area since the beginning of the month, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Five of those people have died. 
</P>
<P>
The girl suffered a bullet wound to the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
She and two of her friends were accosted by a ski-mask clad gunman and an 
accomplice as the trio walked down a street in Brownsville, Police Sgt. Grace 
Ridley said. 
</P>
<P>
The girls initially refused the robbers' demands for their nylon jackets -- 
which had the word Columbia on them -- but two of them finally relented after 
the armed bandit fired a shot in the air. As the two robbers fled, the gunman 
randomly fired three more shots, one of which hit the 13-year-old girl.

Two sailors from the aircraft carrier Midway were killed when a tour bus they

Five other U.S. sailors were injured, two of whom were in serious condition 
after the accident Sunday about 50 miles south of al-Dhafra air base in Abu 
Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
The sailors were on shore leave, taking an off-road tour in an all-terrain bus 
when the accident occurred, the military said. 
</P>
<P>
A Navy spokesman said that because of the remoteness of the area, helicopters 
from the Midway flew to the scene to assist local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
One of the injured was flown to the hospital ship Comfort and three to the 
Midway. The whereabouts of the fifth was not immediately known. 
</P>
<P>
The accident brought the number of U.S. deaths in Operation Desert Shield to 
80. On Saturday in the Mediterranean, a chartered Israeli ferry carrying U.S. 
sailors capsized while returning to the Saratoga from the Israeli port of 
Haifa, killing 21.

Israel's ambassador to Bonn urged Soviet Jewish immigrants today to seek refuge 
first in the Jewish state, instead of Germany. 
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Benjamin Navon, in an interview with the Berlin daily Neue Zeit, 
said Israel is troubled that Soviet Jews fleeing anti-Semitism and dismal 
living conditions are streaming to newly united Germany. 
</P>
<P>
"This migration brings us certain difficulties. They want to come to Germany as 
refugees. But this is contrary to the Zionist position that since the state of 
Israel has existed, there can be no more Jewish refugees in the world," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"The issue of refugees is totally unacceptable for us. If they leave the Soviet 
Union, they should come to their old and new homeland Israel, where they are 
wanted and loved. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to emigrate (again) from there, that is their own free decision. 
Then they would be going as emigrants, not as refugees," Navon said.

everybody's heart is in the right place," said the Santa Claus, Lt. Col. Bob 
Murphy, 43, of Fayetteville, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
He was dressed in a Santa suit, complete with white whiskers and black boots. 
He handed out razor blades, candy, Frisbees, yo-yos and other gifts stashed in 
a brown garbage can liner. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, we'd love to be home with our loved ones, but, my gosh, we got an 
important mission to do over here," Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
The Army division's band, led by Chief Warrant Officer Willie James Lockett, 
played "Deck the Halls" to entertain the troops. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing this so the soldier won't be lonely and think about what it's like 
back in the world where he isn't," said Lockett, 35, of Jacksonville, Fla., a 
17-year Army veteran. "My Christmas tree will be up whenever I get back. If 
it's the year 2002, that sucker will still be up." 
</P>
<P>
Chief Warrant Officer Ben Cooper, 30, of Monticello, Ark., finished first in 
the jog with a time of 24 minutes, 31 seconds. Keeping busy helped keep his 
mind off his wife and three children back home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"You try to stay occupied instead of sitting around moping (and) thinking about 
how bad off you are," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Michael Thomas, 30, of Trenton, N.J., ran the race wearing a Santa's cap 
and a pair of Bart Simpson shorts. He's been away from home six times in the 
last eight years. He even saw a bright spot in spending Christmas in the 
desert. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, out here, we're away from the commercial side of Christmas," he 
said. "You have to look inside yourself to find the real Christmas spirit." 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Lisa Titus, 27, of the Army's 18th Airborne Corps, got time off to run the 
race with her husband, Greg, a captain who commands a battery of artillery with 
the 82nd Airborne. 
</P>
<P>
She sat on Santa's lap but didn't make a Christmas wish.

Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co. said today its stake in Isosceles PLC will 
be diluted as a result of the British company's decision to proceed with an 
equity financing. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;P currently holds a 19.9% interest in Isosceles, which will raise about 
$422 million via the financing as part of a capital restructuring recently 
approved by the Isosceles board. 
</P>
<P>
A&amp;P said it does not plan to purchase any shares in the offering of new 
equity and converted debt but intends to vote in favor of shareholder 
resolutions needed to authorize the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
Pending completion of the offering, A&amp;P's equity position will be reduced 
to 6.6% of Isosceles. A&amp;P will retain its director's seat on the Isosceles 
board.

A shopping mall in Hiroshima repainted a huge rooftop Santa Claus it had 
portrayed as a black man after black residents reportedly complained, a 
professor said today. 
</P>
<P>
The 18-foot-high black Santa had exaggeratedly fat lips, diamond-studded rings, 
sunglasses and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
Such caricatures of blacks are common in Japanese advertising but are becoming 
less popular because of criticism of racial stereotyping. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa was put up in November on a fake brick chimney above the Sun Mall in 
Hiroshima, 430 miles southwest of Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Goldsbury, a professor of philosophy at Hiroshima University, put a photo 
of the Santa on the cover of his local magazine, "Hiroshima Sign Post," after 
he heard that black foreigners living in the city were upset by the figure's 
exaggerated features. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to make people talk," Goldsbury said. "Hiroshima is supposed to be a 
center of 'international peace culture,' but here was yet another example of 
undesirable cultural stereotyping."

Hundreds of stores in England and Wales opened in defiance of Sunday trading 
laws, taking advantage of one of the last two shopping days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
The open violations of the law, in some cases advertised in the newspapers, 
followed similar openings last week. 
</P>
<P>
For the large stores, drawing thousands of customers, the fines levied against 
them are not a hardship. 
</P>
<P>
Some managers reported "absolutely fantastic" business, the shop-workers' union 
said it wasn't fair to the staffs and the Keep Sunday Special campaign said 
people were complaining that the shop openings disrupted family life. 
</P>
<P>
The issue of Sunday trading has been controversial for years. Prime Minister 
John Major said in Parliament last week that the time is approaching for talks 
to find a compromise.

"The Japanese judge kept asking me, 'You are? You are?' For the first time in

South Dakota is making progress in improving relations between Indians and 
whites, said Mills, who now lives in California. But Mills, 52, said Indians 
still have difficulty getting the respect and representation they deserve.

"I live for the day when there is a constitutional amendment to elect two 
at-large senators to represent all Indian tribes," he said. "Then and only then

NFL PLAYOFFS;

<P>
UNRAVELING MYSTERY OF THE TIE-BREAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM LITKE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The NFL's tie-breaking procedures are supposed to reveal who's in and who's out 
of the postseason. But heading into the final weekend with six teams coveting 
three remaining slots, we are reminded again that deciphering the Dead Sea 
Scrolls probably was easier. 
</P>
<P>
And if the NFL keeps adding to the burden -- remember, this season is the first 
with three wild-card slots available in each conference -- it is hardly going 
to be worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
Under the league's rules, as many as nine steps might be applied if the tie to 
be broken involves teams in the same division; eight if tie-breaking is needed 
to determine the wild-card teams. But the only step that most people readily 
grasp, under either scenario, is the last one: Flip a coin. 
</P>
<P>
"Really, you'd be surprised at how many fans are knowledgeable about this 
stuff," said Pete Abitante, whose job it is to determine the AFC playoff 
entrants. It kept him working late into the night Sunday at the league's 
headquarters. "In a sense, it's like learning a foreign language -- you're 
always trying to figure which situation applies in which case. 
</P>
<P>
"But there are obviously a lot of other people doing it. I get plenty of calls 
around this time of year from people who say, 'I've got it figured this way,' 
and they ask if there's anything they might have missed." 
</P>
<P>
"And when you straighten them out," he added, "they really thank you for it." 
</P>
<P>
Abitante has no way of knowing how many of the callers happen to be employed by 
the NFL as general managers, coaches or players. But it's a safe bet that the 
long-distance lines from the four cities still chasing the two remaining AFC 
spots -- Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Houston and Seattle -- to his extension in New 
York will be humming in the days to come. 
</P>
<P>
Under one punishing scenario, the Steelers, who are alone at the top of the AFC 
Central Division this week, could be out of the playoffs altogether by this 
same time next week. 
</P>
<P>
A Pittsburgh loss at Houston, coupled with a Cincinnati victory over the lowly 
Cleveland Browns, would leave all three teams at 9-7. But Cincinnati would 
claim the AFC Central title by virtue of beating the Steelers in head-to-head 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
Houston or Seattle would then get the wild-card berth, leaving Pittsburgh out 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
"Maybe it's better that we have to win," Steeler cornerback David Johnson said. 
"If we knew there was a chance we could lose and still make the playoffs, who 
knows? Maybe we'd relax." 
</P>
<P>
If it's any consolation to Johnson, the Bengals and the Oilers won't be 
breathing any easier next week. Seattle also could finish 9-7 (or 8-8 if both 
Cincinnati and Houston lose as well), and because of this head-to-head 
business, nose out either of them for the wild card. 
</P>
<P>
The NFC, thankfully, is easier to figure because only two teams -- Dallas and 
New Orleans -- are circling the last musical chair. If the Cowboys win Sunday 
against the Falcons, regardless of how the Saints do against the Rams, they're 
in. If both lose, Dallas still wins. 
</P>
<P>
But that kind of simplicity carries a price; under that both-teams-losing 
scenario, the Cowboys, at 7-9, would mark the first time a team with a losing 
record made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
It was that very danger -- diluting the product -- that was raised earlier this 
year when the NFL announced in March that it was expanding the playoffs by 
adding a third wild-card team to each conference.

ALOHA BOWL;

SYRACUSE DOESN'T WANT A CHRISTMAS TIE

Syracuse and Arizona want to work out some frustrations on each other in the 
Aloha Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Early ties against Michigan State and Pittsburgh started the Orangemen toward a 
disappointing 6-4-2 finish. Arizona's wins over nationally ranked Illinois and 
USC were coupled with losses to Oregon State, Stanford and California as the 
Wildcats finished 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We could have had a lot more," said Arizona All-American cornerback Darryl 
Lewis, the Pacific 10 Conference's co-defensive player of the year. "It's been 
a strange year, beating powerhouse teams and losing to weak teams." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't feel that 1990 has been the year that we wanted it to be," Syracuse 
Coach Dick MacPherson said. "I don't think we recovered from those ties." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona is a slight underdog going into the Christmas Day game, but MacPherson 
said the teams match up pretty evenly. 
</P>
<P>
"It becomes a question of execution and turnovers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams have question marks: Can Arizona's running game sustain long drives 
against the Orangemen? How will Syracuse's balanced offensive package stand up 
to Arizona's defense? Will the teams avoid inconsistencies that have plagued 
them this season? 
</P>
<P>
Arizona this season became only the second Pac-10 team to defeat USC and UCLA 
on the road in the same season. But sandwiched between those victories was a 
27-21 loss to Oregon State, the Beavers' only victory this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our losses were more mental than physical," Arizona running back Art 
Greathouse said. "We have to get everybody ready to play." 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse, making its fourth straight bowl appearance, hopes to show that 
despite its record it's a bowl-caliber team. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an up-and-down season, but we can end it on a good note with a 
seventh win," quarterback Marvin Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
Graves, a redshirt freshman, recovered from a slow start to complete 58% of his 
passes for 1,711 yards and nine touchdowns. He was intercepted 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
MacPherson thinks Graves' best years are yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he's one of the most pure passers -- in terms of a gun -- I've ever 
seen," MacPherson said.

MELVIN DURSLAG: IN FOOTBALL, THERE'S NO PLACE LIKE HOME FOR THE POSTSEASON

When Bud Grant was coaching the Minnesota Vikings, chronic entrant in the 
postseason football tournament, he was asked how he would feel losing the 
home-field edge. Bud responded: 
</P>
<P>
"All places I've been, the field measures 100 yards long by 53 1/3 yards wide. 
Each side has featured 11 people at a time. And each has been allowed four 
tries to make a first down. If I go somewhere and find any variations to the 
foregoing, I will worry. Otherwise, I won't." 
</P>
<P>
It is standard at this time of year, though, for most teams to worry enormously 
about home field. Is the advantage real, or is it another phantom galloping 
through the minds of coaches beset with a multitude of other worries? 
</P>
<P>
You begin your exploration of the subject by citing the practices of those who 
make odds in the neighborly state of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
To them, home field normally is worth three points. If, for instance, the 49ers 
were to play the Giants in San Francisco and the oddsmaker saw the 49ers as a 
point better, he would hang up a price of four points, allowing for home field. 
</P>
<P>
An exception to the rule is Los Angeles, where home field is rated only two 
points, mainly because of the composition of those inhabiting the seats. A 
visiting team in Los Angeles picks up more friends than anyplace else. 
</P>
<P>
Why would a partial crowd influence the price on a football game? Two reasons 
are advanced. 
</P>
<P>
First, noisemaking on its part when the visitors are trying to call signals 
damages the visitors' offense. As many as 15% of a team's plays can be 
audibilized. When those involved can't hear, this weapon is partly wiped out. 
</P>
<P>
Secondly, oddsmakers don't feel officials are crooked, but they do feel, 
however unconsciously, they can be intimidated by a home crowd. 
</P>
<P>
Discussing home field one time with Dan Reeves, coach of Denver, we were told 
that atmospheric conditions on the road always must be considered. 
</P>
<P>
"A thrower must understand the wind," said Dan, "and the receivers have to know 
where the sun is." 
</P>
<P>
If, in late afternoon, a receiver doesn't find the sun in the west, he has a 
problem shared by many. 
</P>
<P>
When Seattle's Chuck Knox took his team to the playoffs one year, he was asked 
if stadium conditions and hostile crowds troubled him. 
</P>
<P>
"Not as much as planes, buses and hotels," answered Chuck. "When planes and 
buses are late, your players get upset. They also get upset if service is slow 
in the coffee shop." 
</P>
<P>
You can see the case with which the delicate cerebral machinery of today's 
entertainer can be tilted. 
</P>
<P>
OK, the last time the Raiders go to the playoffs, in 1985, we ask the 
celebrated strategist, Al Davis, how a visiting team can suffer playing on 
alien grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Al answers they suffer for lack of cheers. 
</P>
<P>
"Football players need reaffirmation," he says. "It begins in college with 
rallies, bonfires, booster functions. The roar of the crowd makes them feel 
loved. They seem to draw strength from it." 
</P>
<P>
He is asked: "Can they do anything in postseason to make it fair for both 
entrants?" 
</P>
<P>
"Yes," he replies. "They can play the games in Japan where it is the custom at 
sporting events to applaud both sides." 
</P>
<P>
Since the playoffs have become such a vital component of professional football, 
many have argued that the games be played on neutral fields, principally on the 
ground that too much is at stake for a team to have a bulge once the tournament 
begins. 
</P>
<P>
But the counterargument is that if home field in the playoffs isn't determined 
by a team's record during regular season, teams clinching playoff spots before 
the end of the season will dog it, depriving fans of their money's worth. 
</P>
<P>
For the playoffs, the home-field neurosis isn't going to vanish, but if 
visiting players need love, as Al Davis deduces, a way must be found to get 
this commodity delivered.

Why did Francis Ford Coppola make "The Godfather, Part III"? 
</P>
<P>
"For the same reasons I made the second one: it didn't go away, and they 
basically promised me carte blanche," Coppola, 51, said in Sunday's New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Godfather' became my claim to fame and my claim to be able to continue 
making movies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The first two "Godfathers" are the only movie and its sequel to both win the 
Academy Award for best picture. Earlier this year Coppola filed for bankruptcy 
and claims to owe up to $7 million after such flops as "The Cotton Club" and 
"One From the Heart." 
</P>
<P>
"I began to realize I didn't know who my audience was," he told the Times. 
"When I made a film, a ton of people didn't just turn out to see it." 
</P>
<P>
He said he began to realize that he was getting older and didn't have a big 
audience anymore. 
</P>
<P>
" 'The Godfather' always represented to me a chance to have a big audience," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Coppola will earn $5 million for writing, directing and producing the third 
chapter of the saga, plus a 15% share of the gross.

LIZ SMITH: LIZA, GERO A PAIR APART; NICHOLSON'S EYES ON ANJELICA

HERE IS A P.S. on the Liza Minnelli marriage situation. She and her artist 
husband, Mark Gero, have mutually agreed to separate. I am told by their 
intimates that "this is all they'd like to say right now." 
</P>
<P>
Liza and Mark have been married since Dec. 4, 1979. It was Liza's third 
marriage, after Peter Allen and Jack Haley. 
</P>
<P>
I ran into Liza at the Frank Sinatra birthday party last week. She was glowing 
and crowing, having a wonderful time, looking great, and telling me about a new 
movie of hers that she wanted me to see. Liza was with her sister, Lorna Luft, 
who is currently knocking them dead in the Rainbow &amp; Stars at New York's 
Rockefeller Center. 
</P>
<P>
Liza and Lorna spent most of their time with me raving about Lorna's baby 
daughter, Vanessa Jade. Lorna said: "She may be my child, but she is just Liza 
all over again. She looks like Liza, behaves like Liza. I just wonder how this 
could be? It's my baby, but it's Liza Minnelli; very spooky." 
</P>
<P>
Liza just laughed, winked at me and pretended to buff her nails. 
</P>
<P>
THEY DO say Anjelica Huston's performance as a blond con woman in "The 
Grifters" is Oscar bait. And last week the Los Angeles Film Critics gave her 
their award, so anything can happen at the Academy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
But that's not the big news about Anjelica. The speculation goes that Anjelica 
and her ex-lover of 17 years, Jack Nicholson, are about to forge a reunion of 
the professional kind. 
</P>
<P>
Nicholson told Life magazine earlier this year that he wanted very much to act 
with Anjelica again. They played together marvelously in "Prizzi's Honor." (He 
is said also personally to miss her friendship very much.) Now he wants her to 
play Josephine to his film Napoleon. 
</P>
<P>
Does history repeat? Josephine was the love of Napoleon's life, but he had to 
set her aside to wed an Austrian princess who could give him an heir. The long 
affair of Nicholson and Huston came to a halt when Nicholson had a child out of 
wedlock with another actress, Rebecca Broussard. 
</P>
<P>
It would be fun to see Anjelica in those period Empire dresses, doing her stuff 
as a woman scorned. And Jack? It's always fun to see Jack in any guise 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
They are two of the acting greats of our time.

'BONFIRE' HARD ON WHITES: HANKS

<TEXT>
<P>
Actor Tom Hanks says charges of racism in "The Bonfire of the Vanities" may be 
misdirected because the movie hits rich, white people most of all. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't worry much about the racist angle," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"The story is hard on everybody, probably hardest of all on the white Park 
Avenue types." 
</P>
<P>
Director Brian DePalma ran into considerable community opposition while making 
the movie, particularly from blacks. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview published Sunday in The Tennessean, Hanks said he was "bracing 
to hear from the Southern belle lobbyists. My mistress in the movie is not a 
very flattering example of Southern womanhood." 
</P>
<P>
The star of "Splash," "Dragnet" and "Big" said that the offer from DePalma to 
play selfish yuppie Sherman McCoy came as a surprise and that he thought the 
offer was a joke.
