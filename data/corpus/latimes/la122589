<P>
For New Orleans, it was a great finish to a disappointing season. For 
Indianapolis, it was a disappointing ending to a promising season. 
</P>
<P>
John Fourcade passed for two touchdowns and ran for one Sunday, leading New 
Orleans to a 41-6 victory over Indianapolis that ended the Colts' playoff hopes 
and gave the Saints an unprecedented third straight winning season. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything rolled their way," Colt Coach Ron Meyer said. "It looked like we 
were always a play behind them." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans, which never finished above the .500 mark in its first 20 seasons, 
failed to make the playoffs despite a 9-7 record. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts, who needed a victory to gain a wild-card berth, finished 8-8, one 
game behind Buffalo in the AFC East. 
</P>
<P>
Fourcade, who had never started a regular-season game until three weeks ago, 
completed 21 of 28 passes for 291 yards and ran five times for 30 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He hit Eric Martin with a three-yard touchdown pass in the second quarter and 
Hoby Brenner with a 30-yarder five seconds into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints' quarterback also came up with a few free-lance plays, such as a 
shovel pass to fullback Craig Heyward after being chased from the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to be on a flag football team, and we had that play," Fourcade said. 
"Craig wasn't on that team, but he sure picked it up in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
The Saints won eight of their last 11 games after starting the season 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
"We have nobody to blame but ourselves (for missing the playoffs)," New Orleans 
linebacker Pat Swilling said. "We dug our own hole with that 1-4 start. But it 
still hurts." 
</P>
<P>
The Colts also blew their chance to make the playoffs, but Meyer wasn't bitter 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
"Thank heavens we were in a position to be there," he said. "There were a lot 
of football teams, like the Saints, playing on sheer pride." 
</P>
<P>
New Orleans scored on a seven-yard run by Dalton Hilliard in the third quarter, 
a two-yard run by Fourcade in the fourth period and a 63-yard interception 
return by Toi Cook with 1:37 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Morten Andersen added two field goals for the Saints, a 21-yarder in the first 
quarter and a 29-yarder with 3:05 left to play in the game. 
</P>
<P>
Hilliard scored 114 points and Andersen 104 this season, the first pair of 
100-point scorers in Saints history. Hilliard is the first non-kicker to hit 
the century mark for New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
The Colts' only points came on a pair of field goals by Dean Biasucci in the 
second quarter, from 41 and 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The Saints held Eric Dickerson, who rushed for more than 1,300 yards this 
season, to 54 yards in 16 carries. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea we could hold them without a touchdown," Saint Coach Jim Mora 
said. "We were concerned about their offense, with Dickerson and that offensive 
line they have." 
</P>
<P>
Indianapolis quarterback Jack Trudeau completed 15 of 27 passes for 118 yards 
and was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
Backup Tom Ramsey threw the pass that was picked off by Cook in the final 
quarter.

PACKERS NOW COUNTING ON BENGALS; 
</P>
<P>
PACKERS: AFTER 20-10 VICTORY OVER DALLAS, THEY STILL HAVE A CHANCE FOR THEIR 
FIRST PLAYOFF BERTH SINCE 1982.

<P>
The Packers put themselves in position to win their first divisional title in 
17 seasons and brought an end to the Dallas Cowboys' second-worst season. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay beat Dallas, 20-10, Sunday and would win the NFC Central and go the 
playoffs for the first time since 1982 if the Minnesota Vikings lose to the 
Cincinnati Bengals tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay was eliminated from wild-card contention when the Rams beat New 
England, 24-20. The Packers saw the end of the Ram-Patriot game on television 
and were disappointed when the New England failed to score from the Rams' 
five-yard line at the end. 
</P>
<P>
"We're big Cincinnati fans now," Lion Coach Lindy Infante said. 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay's 10-6 record was its best in 17 years. It was the 14th consecutive 
home loss for Dallas, an NFL record. 
</P>
<P>
"We knew this wouldn't be an easy one, coming into a place where you are 
supposed to win is never easy," Infante said. "We've been playing sudden death 
football for six weeks now. Regardless of what happens we have a lot to be 
proud of." 
</P>
<P>
Dallas finished at 1-15 in Jimmy Johnson's rookie year as coach. The only 
Cowboys team to do worse was in 1960, when they finished 0-11-1. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's behind us," Johnson said. "The Cowboys will have better days in the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Johnson said that the season for Dallas was to assess everything for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a season of evaluation, " he said. "It was a situation where we sat 
back and watched. Next year we will take care of business." 
</P>
<P>
Green Bay's go-ahead touchdown came on a five-yard scoring pass from Majkowski 
to tight end Ed West with 3:58 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Murphy's fourth-quarter fumble recovery at the Green Bay 30 set up a 
63-yard drive that ended with Chris Jacke's 24-yard field goal with 3:24 left. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys tied the score, 10-10, on former Trojan Jack Del Rio's 57-yard 
fumble return with 6:51 left in the third quarter. Jon Carter caused the fumble 
when he hit Brent Fullwood, who was attempting to handoff on a reverse. 
</P>
<P>
A crowd of 41,265 fans watched in 35-degree cold. The Cowboys announced 55,000 
tickets were sold.

49ERS FINISH DECADE IN FINE FASHION; 
</P>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO: TEAM RECORD (14-2) IS EASILY BEST IN THE LEAGUE AFTER SHUTOUT 
VICTORY OVER BEARS.

<TEXT>
<P>
The team of the '80s ended the decade with a bang Sunday while the once-mighty 
Chicago Bears went out with a whimper. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Montana put the cap on a record-breaking regular season as the San 
Francisco 49ers beat the Bears, 26-0, and set their sights on the first Super 
Bowl of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been an extremely exciting 10 years, no question about it," rookie Coach 
George Seifert said after the 49ers (14-2) wrapped up their second-best record 
ever. No other NFL team won more than 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel very fortunate to have been part of it," Seifert said. "The trick now 
is to keep it going." 
</P>
<P>
Montana threw a 29-yard touchdown pass to Jerry Rice and set an NFL season 
record for highest quarterback rating as the 49ers won their fifth consecutive 
game and the Bears dropped their sixth straight. Mike Cofer kicked four field 
goals and won the NFL scoring title with 136 points. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we feel good about what we did today," Montana said, shrugging off 
talk of personal achievements. "It took a while to get things going, but our 
defense just played a heck of a game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, whose better record was 15-1 in 1984 en route to their second of 
three Super Bowl championships, will have a week off before playing host to an 
NFC playoff game against either Philadelphia or the NFC Central champion. 
</P>
<P>
Chicago Coach Mike Ditka vowed the Bears would bounce back after "hitting 
bottom" with 10 losses in their last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
"Somewhere along the line we lost our confidence," Ditka said. "I don't really 
believe we're that bad a football team, although I guess you have to believe 
that after today. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a bad day and it's been a sad season, but they come and go. We've had a 
lot of great seasons. . . . If all of a sudden football passed us by in '89, 
and I don't think it did, then I'd say we change the system. But we just 
haven't executed very well." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago missed the playoffs for the first time since 1983.

The Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins battled for 60 minutes, then learned 
their game had been meaningless in the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
Nick Lowery kicked a 41-yard field goal with 1:31 left to give Kansas City a 
27-24 victory Sunday. A few minutes later, Pittsburgh completed a 31-22 victory 
over Tampa Bay that ensured both AFC wild-card teams will be from the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Chiefs (8-7-1) won four of their final five games to finish over .500 for 
only the second time since 1981. But Kansas City failed to make the playoffs 
for the 17th time in the past 18 years. 
</P>
<P>
Houston (9-7) will be one AFC wild-card team. Cincinnati (8-7) will be the 
other if the Bengals beat Minnesota tonight. If they don't, Pittsburgh (9-7) 
will make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Miami finished 8-8 and would have been eliminated from the playoffs even with a 
victory Sunday. The Dolphins lost four of their final five games and for the 
fourth consecutive year failed to make the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Dolphins had rallied from a 24-14 deficit with two fourth-quarter scores to 
tie Sunday's game with 4:24 to go. But Kansas City moved 44 yards in nine plays 
to set up Lowery's field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Marino then hit Mark Clayton for 35 yards to the Chiefs' 45-yard line, but 
on the next series Clayton dropped a fourth-down pass at the Chiefs' 29 with 
1:02 left. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City's Christian Okoye carried 26 times for 98 yards to all but clinch 
his first NFL rushing title. He finished with 1,480 yards in 370 carries, both 
team records. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty big goal for me to lead the league in rushing," said Okoye, who 
attended Azusa Pacific College. "To look at it and say I did it, thank God."

"May God prosper the efforts of all those . . . seeking a just solution to the 
grave problems which delay the return to normality greatly desired by all 
Lebanese," the Pope said in a letter to Maronite Christian Patriarch Nasrallah 
Pierre Sfeir. The text was released by the Vatican on Sunday.

BRITISH OFFICIAL DEFENDS HONG KONG CITIZENSHIP PLAN

Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has defended the government's plan to give full 
British citizenship to up to 50,000 professionals and their families -- about 
225,000 people in all from Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said in the Sunday Express that the move was necessary to persuade 
professionals essential for Hong Kong's prosperity not to emigrate before the 
British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
Confidence in Hong Kong has plummeted since the Chinese army brutally repressed 
pro-democracy protesters in Beijing in June. 
</P>
<P>
Hurd said that assurances for the colony are needed because many people have 
already left. "The lifeblood of Hong Kong is being drained away." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the package was designed to give Hong Kong citizens most likely 
to emigrate an "insurance policy" of right of abode in Britain if needed after 
1997, thus encouraging them to stay in the colony. 
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong legislators have described the British government's proposal as 
potentially divisive and pledged to fight for the rights of all 3.25 million 
British passport-holders in the colony.

VOLCANO MONITORED FOR MOLTEN ROCK

Although Redoubt Volcano has been fairly quiet in recent days since it exploded 
back to life this month, geologists said Sunday magma, or molten rock, may be 
very near the volcano's crater floor. 
</P>
<P>
But Steve Brantley, a geologist with the Alaska Volcano Observatory, said 
scientists will have to wait until poor weather conditions improve for them to 
fly over the volcano to confirm their suspicions. 
</P>
<P>
The crater floor is estimated to be about 200 feet from the volcano's summit, 
Brantley said. 
</P>
<P>
Observatory officials have been monitoring the volcano around the clock since 
it began rumbling earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
The latest series of eruptions at the 10,197-foot volcano, 110 miles southwest 
of Anchorage, began Dec. 14, sending ash plumes several thousand feet into the 
air and temporarily grounding thousands of frustrated holiday travelers. Air 
travel has since returned to normal with no reports of ash for several days. 
</P>
<P>
Brantley said subtle changes in the type and number of earthquakes at the 
volcano's summit suggest the presence of molten rock.

OLD COURT CASES SIFTED FOR CLUES AFTER BOMBING ATTACK ON JUDGE

<P>
Police and postal inspectors spent Sunday reviewing evidence in a bomb attack 
that injured a Washington County judge, sifting through old court cases to see 
if a criminal he sentenced might have held a grudge. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. postal inspectors took over as the lead investigators after determining 
Saturday that one of two package bombs that injured Judge John P. Corderman on 
Friday was delivered by a postal carrier. 
</P>
<P>
Corderman, 47, continued recovering in the Washington County Hospital on Sunday 
from surgery to remove shrapnel that was embedded in his abdomen when the bomb 
exploded in his apartment. He was in good condition and was expected to be 
released in a few days, possibly as early as today, said Sheran White, a 
hospital spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Morgan, the Postal Service's inspector-in-charge in Baltimore, said the 
Postal Service would test fragments from the explosives at their Washington, 
D.C., lab this week, once the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms completes 
its review. 
</P>
<P>
"We are using every lead, and obviously, with a judge that hears 100 to 150 
cases each year, (old cases are) part of our investigation that we're looking 
into," Morgan said. He acknowledged that the Christmas holidays would delay 
some aspects of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators were quoted in Sunday's Baltimore Sun as saying they planned to 
focus on drug cases Corderman has heard, but Morgan said the review wouldn't be 
that limited. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not focusing on any particular type of cases," he said. "I think it's a 
common sense approach to the investigation, looking at anyone who might 
possibly have a grudge against the judge. He hears more than drug cases, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
Corderman has a reputation for delivering tough sentences, and has taken a hard 
line in the past in cases involving drugs, gambling and illegal gun use. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to performing surgery on Corderman's abdomen, doctors at Washington 
County Hospital removed an eighth of an inch of his middle finger and said he 
suffered damage to his eardrums from the bomb blast. 
</P>
<P>
While hospitalized, he remained under police guard and officers have been 
assigned to watch his immediate family as well.

CLAIRE MARINE'S UNIQUE LOVE OF HOLLYWOOD PARK RESURFACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Chris McCarron was sorry Claire Marine didn't have one more opponent in the 
$200,000 Matriarch on closing day at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
"The way she ran today or the way she ran in Chicago (the Beverly D.) or when 
Robbie (Davis) rode her at Del Mar (the Palomar Handicap), I don't think Brown 
Bess would have beaten her," McCarron said after completing a stakes sweep for 
trainer Charlie Whittingham. Ruhlmann had won the Native Diver Handicap the day 
before. "But we won't find that out until next year." 
</P>
<P>
At one time, Brown Bess was coming south for the Grade I Matriarch, but her 
handlers decided to give her some time off and she won't be seen for several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
However, the 7-year-old Northern California-based mare easily dispatched Claire 
Marine and nine others in Oak Tree's Yellow Ribbon and probably earned herself 
an Eclipse Award as the nation's top female grass performer. 
</P>
<P>
This honor seemed destined for Claire Marine, but her fifth in the Yellow 
Ribbon was preceded by a fourth-place finish at 4-5 in the Las Palmas Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
Moving over to Inglewood, the 4-year-old What A Guest filly bounced back, and 
although she has won seven races this year at four tracks, it is apparent she 
has a special affinity for the Hollywood Park turf. 
</P>
<P>
Her latest victory, a wire-to-wire, one-length decision over 22-1 shot General 
Charge, was her third in four starts at Hollywood Park. Her only loss was by a 
nose to stablemate Fitzwilliam Place in the Gamely. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't handle the track at Santa Anita like she did this one," said 
Whittingham after his fourth stakes victory of the 30-day meeting. "Plus, she 
was giving a lot of weight in those races and it was kind of even today. She 
also had a trip to Chicago before those races." 
</P>
<P>
Still, her sixth added-money victory of 1989 probably won't be enough to earn 
her the Eclipse. "It's not over 'til it's over," Whittingham said. 
</P>
<P>
McCarron, who has been Claire Marine's jockey in all but three of her 12 races 
this year, didn't think she had any particular dislike for the Santa Anita 
grass. 
</P>
<P>
"She didn't act like she wasn't handling it," he said. "She never bobbled or 
took any bad steps. She just didn't run her race either time. 
</P>
<P>
"Charlie wanted a good fresh filly for the Yellow Ribbon, so he didn't crank 
her up real hard for the Las Palmas. We wanted to win, but she came up a little 
empty that day. I thought it was possible she just needed the race. 
</P>
<P>
"Then, when she didn't run well in the Yellow Ribbon, I didn't know what to 
think." 
</P>
<P>
With a couple of sharp recent works, including a :57 for five furlongs last 
Tuesday, Claire Marine signaled she was back and it was apparent after the 
first quarter-mile of the Matriarch she was going to be hard to catch. 
</P>
<P>
Relaxing nicely, the 11-10 second choice had restrained early fractions of :23 
4/5 and :48 2/5. She had more than enough left to beat General Charge while 
completing the last furlong in a rapid :11 4/5 en route to a final time of 1:47 
2/5 for the 1 1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
"It's no problem getting her to relax," said McCarron. "She just threw her ears 
straight up right away and loped around there." 
</P>
<P>
Claire Marine will continue racing next year. 
</P>
<P>
The Matriarch disappointments were Colorado Dancer and Royal Touch, two-thirds 
of the entry which was the slim betting favorite. Fourth in the Breeders' Cup 
Mile, beaten only a length and a half by Steinlen, Royal Touch finished third 
Sunday, nearly four lengths behind. A half-length behind her was Colorado 
Dancer, who finished third in the Yellow Ribbon, her first U.S. race. 
</P>
<P>
"No excuses," said Russell Baze of Royal Touch, who will remain in 
Whittingham's barn after being saddled by John Hammond for this race. "I think 
she probably prefers a softer course. She better get used to a firm track if 
she's going to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
Laffit Pincay, who also rode Colorado Dancer in the Yellow Ribbon, was puzzled 
by her performance. 
</P>
<P>
"She was a little bit fresh and tried to run (off) the first part, but I got 
through along the inside," he said. "She gave it up a little the last part. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran much better the last time, there's no question about that. But I still 
think she's a good filly." 
</P>
<P>
Far and away the longest shot in the field, General Charge looked like she 
might beat Claire Marine at one point in the stretch, and she might have staged 
an upset if the late-runner had gotten any help up front. 
</P>
<P>
"She ran a dynamite race," said Robbie Davis of Bobby Frankel's 3-year-old 
General Assembly filly. "She's been kind of a hard-luck filly. She always tries 
hard, but something always seems to happen. She's only won one race on the turf 
and she probably should have won two or three. 
</P>
<P>
"The outside post killed us. We were wide on both turns. Charlie and Chris can 
be pretty tough on a guy. I should know." 
</P>
<P>
Davis, who had four seconds, three thirds and a sixth in eight rides Sunday, 
also had to settle for second in the Native Diver when Lively One's late rally 
came up a neck short. 
</P>
<P>
Continuing its trend, Hollywood Park showed declines in both on-track 
attendance and handle. 
</P>
<P>
The average attendance was 15,044, compared to 15,794 in 1988, which was a 
decrease of 4.6%. The average handle decreased 1.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Factoring in the nine intertrack sites, total attendance increased 1.8% from 
'88 and handle increased 3.9%. 
</P>
<P>
Even though he didn't ride the final five days, Eddie Delahoussaye won the 
jockey title, beating Gary Stevens, who also sat out the final week, 30-28. 
Delahoussaye has now won titles at three consecutive meetings. He also won at 
Del Mar and Oak Tree. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Hofmans topped the trainers with 12 victories, two more than Ron McAnally 
and three more than John Sadler.

Hawaii sees the Aloha Bowl as an opportunity to earn the national respect it 
has long sought. 
</P>
<P>
The 25th-ranked Rainbows (9-2-1), of the Western Athletic Conference, will try 
to add a bowl victory to a long list of 1989 accomplishments when they meet No. 
22 Michigan State (7-4) of the Big Ten Conference today. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a chance to show the country what we're all about," Hawaii Coach Bob 
Wagner said. "I mean, they come from one of the oldest conferences in the 
country and we come from the youngest. This is a very big step for our 
program." 
</P>
<P>
For Michigan State, making its fifth bowl appearance in six years, a win would 
help prove that despite four losses this is one of its best teams. 
</P>
<P>
The day will also provide a chance for seniors in the Blue-Gray all-star 
football game in Montgomery, Ala., one final chance to display their skills for 
pro scouts that might be watching.

INTERCEPTIONS NEW TO RAMS' STRICKLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Before Sunday, Ram linebacker Fred Strickland didn't remember intercepting a 
pass in his life. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, he was saving up for the New England Patriots. In the Rams' 24-20 
victory at Sullivan Stadium, Strickland had two key interceptions in the first 
half that may have saved his team's season. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots were second and 13 at the Rams' 14-yard line late in the first 
quarter when Strickland stepped in front of a Marc Wilson pass and returned it 
29 yards, bailing the Rams out of deep trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"On the first one," Strickland said, "LeRoy Irvin came over to me and told me 
to watch out for the quick slant in from the wide out, and as soon as I looked 
at the quarterback he looked that way and I ran right toward the wide out. I 
just tried to run as far as I could run." 
</P>
<P>
Strickland's second interception, in the second quarter, came against Wilson's 
replacement, Steve Grogan. Again, it stopped another potential scoring drive. 
This one came with the Patriots on the Rams' nine with a first down. 
</P>
<P>
Strickland returned this interception 27 yards to the 32. 
</P>
<P>
To put it as mildly as possible, Jim Everett endured the cold. He completed 13 
of 29 passes, had two interceptions and finished with 181 yards, his lowest 
total of the season. 
</P>
<P>
But he also put 24 points on the scoreboard, enough to get the Rams into the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"Mistakes are part of the game," Everett said. "We're human. I made a couple of 
early mistakes, but the main thing is to recover from them. Go on from there. 
Don't dwell on them." 
</P>
<P>
Everett finished the regular season with 4,210 passing yards, the ninth-highest 
total in National Football League history. With one touchdown pass Sunday, 
Everett ended the season with 29, two shy of the Ram record he set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Patriots' four-headed quarterback fell short of 4,000 yards, 
with Steve Grogan, Marc Wilson, Doug Flutie and the recently departed Tony 
Eason combining for 3,957 yards. 
</P>
<P>
The breakdown: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Grogan: 1,697 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wilson: 1,006. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Eason: 761. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Flutie: 493. 
</P>
<P>
Each quarterback had at least three starts, with Grogan leading the pack with 
six. 
</P>
<P>
New England running back John Stephens on the Patriots' 5-11 season: "No one 
person in particular did terribly bad. I'm just glad we were able to stick 
together." 
</P>
<P>
Best politically motivated banner of the year: In reference to Central 
America's most elusive runner, fans in the bleachers at Sullivan Stadium held 
up a poster that read: "Tackle Noriega." 
</P>
<P>
File this one under the Inauspicious Debut category: Crowd favorite Steve 
Grogan got a roaring ovation when he took the field to replace former Raider 
Marc Wilson at quarterback early in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan then fumbled his first snap from center and fell on it for a two-yard 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
On the Patriots' next possession, Grogan's first pass was blocked and, on the 
next play, he lost control of the ball while pump faking. After a television 
replay, the play was ruled an incomplete pass. 
</P>
<P>
Irvin's assessment of Sunday's game: "Just another typical Ram game." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the elements, the Rams drew the fewest number of penalties -- three -- 
of any of their 16 regular-season games. The 26 yards assessed was the 
second-lowest only to the 25 they were charged with in the Oct. 22 game with 
New Orleans.

A Bakersfield weapons manufacturing firm has won a preliminary injunction 
barring state and county authorities from prosecuting it for producing and 
selling guns banned under a new state law. Sacramento Superior Court Judge 
Jeffrey T. Gunther agreed with Amerind Inc.'s contention that it should not be 
prevented from manufacturing weapons for sale to the military, law enforcement 
and out-of-state purchasers. Gunther said his ruling will stand only until the 
issue can be pursued in the courts. A new state law, effective Jan. 1, 
prohibits the sale or manufacture of assault weapons, including the Calico 
M-900 assault carbines and the Calico M-900 pistols made by Amerind. The law 
was enacted after a Jan. 17 shooting in a Stockton schoolyard that left five 
children dead.

RAMS ESCAPE, ENTER PLAYOFFS; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THEY WIN, 24-20, AS PATRIOTS' LAST-SECOND SCORING CHANCE BARELY 
MISSES.

Time stood still here, long enough at least for the Rams to gray a few more 
hairs, fray well-worn nerves, strain overworked larynxes and breeze (as in 
minus-20 windchill) into the playoffs as maybe the wildest cards to enter the 
postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
One second was the loneliest number the Rams had ever known as New England 
quarterback Steve Grogan awaited center snap at the Ram four-yard line with one 
second remaining in the regular season. Gee, who could have guessed it would 
come down to this? 
</P>
<P>
Down four points, Grogan set up camp in his pocket. He pitched stakes. 
</P>
<P>
"Throw the ball!" Rams' linebacker Fred Strickland pleaded as he took turns 
covering receivers who entered his zone. "Throw it! To someone! Pleeeease. That 
one second lasted forever." 
</P>
<P>
Unmoved and untouched by the Rams' prevent defense and pesky three-man rush, 
Grogan took his time before letting the ball go toward receiver Hart Lee Dykes, 
who was tip-toeing the back end line -- one foot out of bounds -- when the pass 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
When Dykes dropped the ball, saving Sunday's 24-20 victory and perhaps their 
season, the Rams dropped their cold-weather capes and stormed the field. They'd 
have kissed the artificial surface at Sullivan Stadium if not for a fear of 
sticking to it. 
</P>
<P>
By the skin of their teeth, however, the Rams are bound for a wild-card game at 
Philadelphia Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play like a team destined to win it all," cornerback LeRoy Irvin 
said. "As usual, we made it a tough ball game." 
</P>
<P>
Tough ball game? 
</P>
<P>
Consider these highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ram tight end Damone Johnson dropped a sure touchdown pass in the first 
quarter, the Rams settling instead for a 19-yard Mike Lansford field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- At the end of the half, the Rams allowed the Patriots a 25-yard, 
desperation completion with one second left to set up Jason Staurovsky's 
44-yard field goal as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lansford, his bare foot reduced to a fleshy Popsicle in the frigid weather, 
saw his 50-yard field goal attempt bounce off the left upright in the third 
quarter. Ouch, that hurt. 
</P>
<P>
But what is a 17-3 lead with 9:24 remaining in the third quarter when the Rams 
are in town? 
</P>
<P>
Just let your 35-year-old backup quarterback loosen up a bit and let him go at 
the Rams' secondary. And that's what the Patriots did with Grogan, who replaced 
starter Marc Wilson in the second quarter and ended up with 313 passing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Behind by two touchdowns, Grogan let one fly to receiver Irving Fryar, who 
escaped the Rams' coverage and jogged in for a 47-yard scoring pass play with 
6:39 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
After Lansford's 50-yard attempt sent shivers down a goal post, Grogan marched 
on without a care, his team in no playoff race to speak of. 
</P>
<P>
"When we didn't put them away early, they were all foot-loose and fancy free," 
Ram Coach John Robinson said later. "We've all seen games like this." 
</P>
<P>
So, when the Patriots faced fourth-and-six at the Ram 37 late in the third 
quarter, they didn't do the sensible thing and summon the punt team. That's the 
strategy of playoff teams, not one playing out a string while trying to please 
what's left of 27,940 fans who bothered to show up on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Grogan, instead, passed to Fryar for eight yards and a first down. A few plays 
later, John Stephens swept left from four yards out for the game-tying 
touchdown with 11:32. 
</P>
<P>
So flustered, the Rams could barely keep hold of the ball on their next 
possession, let alone advance it. They punted, instead, almost begging to be 
punished. The Patriots obliged when Staurovsky put his team ahead, 20-17, on a 
48-yard field goal with 5:28 left. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, quarterback Jim Everett was sifting through old Ram game plans, 
trying to figure the coolest way to pull off his sixth fourth-quarter comeback 
of the season. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a situation where we were definitely saying we were here before," 
Everett said. "This was so typical of the way this season is going." 
</P>
<P>
Everett took over on his 20 with 5:19 remaining. Free safety Fred Marion nearly 
picked off his pass on first down, but Everett countered on his second with a 
53-yard pass play to Henry Ellard to the New England 27. 
</P>
<P>
From there, tailback Greg Bell, who had dominated the game to that point, took 
over. He had consecutive runs of five, seven, six and six yards to the Patriot 
three, where he was stopped only by the two-minute warning. 
</P>
<P>
On first and goal at the three, Bell used blocks from right tackle Jackie 
Slater and fullback Buford McGee to wedge his way in for the go-ahead score 
with 1:55 left. 
</P>
<P>
Bell, who had totaled only 213 rushing yards in his last six games, finished 
with 210 yards in 26 carries against the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
On one Ram scoring drive in the third quarter, Bell gained 63 of his team's 92 
yards in four carries before collapsing in exhaustion after a 30-yard burst to 
the New England 32. 
</P>
<P>
Some doubted if Bell would ever reach 1,000 yards this season, even after he 
gained 556 yards the first six weeks. He needed 73 yards to reach the mark 
Sunday, and eliminated the suspense by rushing for 88 yards in the first 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"Personal goals are not important," he said. "As long as I'm doing things that 
are needed, other running backs in the system can be more important. This team 
has a lot of dimensions and if we keep that balance going, maybe they'll call 
us the team of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
But no one was convinced the game was over after Bell scored with 1:55 left. 
You need only inspect the Rams' track record. Sure enough, the ensuing kickoff 
was squibbed, short, and returned eight yards to the Patriot 37. From there, 
Grogan pecked away at the Rams' zone. The Patriots made it to the Ram 28 with 
33 seconds left, and still had a timeout remaining. 
</P>
<P>
On second and five at the 23, Grogan then threw 19 yards to a former Ram, Eric 
Sievers, who held on at the four despite a hammer-like blow delivered by safety 
Vince Newsome. New England called time out with nine seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Then, crunch time. Grogan had Fryar open on first down, but he made the catch 
out of bounds. On second down, Grogan misfired to an open Sievers in the back 
of the end zone. Some Rams thought the game had ended. But there was one more 
second, and one more shot. 
</P>
<P>
Fritz Shurmur, Ram defensive coordinator, one second from explaining once more 
a zone defense that has no pass rush, could hardly watch the last play unfold. 
</P>
<P>
"I've probably lost eight years off my life this year," Shurmur said. 
</P>
<P>
But Shurmur ordered zone defense again for the last play and bit his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
"I said to myself 'If you blitz, Fritz, you dummy, they'll get you in 
man-coverage and they'll score again.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Rams didn't blitz. They gave Grogan all the time in the world. He needed 
more. 
</P>
<P>
"Prevent defense my butt," Shurmur said as he raced for the team charter. "They 
didn't score at the end." 
</P>
<P>
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
Although the Rams and Philadelphia Eagles both finished at 11-5, the Eagles 
will play host to the wild-card game based on a better record against common 
opponents than the Rams, 7-3 to 5-4. . . . Duval Love started at right guard in 
place of Tony Slaton. It was Love's first start of the season. . . . Kevin 
Greene's eight-yard sack of Steve Grogan late in the second quarter gave him 
16.5 for the season, tying last-year's total. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Bell's 200-yard performance was his second this season and the third of 
his career. Bell has rushed for more than 100 yards in a game eight times since 
joining the Rams in 1987. Bell finishes the season with 1,137 yards and 15 
rushing touchdowns. . . . After two critical first-quarter interceptions, Jim 
Everett recovered to finish 13 of 29 for 181 yards and a touchdown. . . . The 
Rams reported injuries to Bell (ribs), Brett Faryniarz (right hamstring), Shawn 
Miller (groin), Larry Kelm (dislocated index finger) and Cliff Hicks (right 
knee sprain). Of the injuries, Hicks' appeared the most serious. . . . 
Cornerback Jerry Gray, who has missed several chances at interceptions this 
season, picked off a Grogan pass in the first half and returned it 27 yards for 
a touchdown. . . . Linebacker Fred Strickland had two interceptions in the 
first half, with returns of 29 and 27 yards, respectively.

RAIDER FINISH LINE: OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS, MAYBE OUT OF L.A.

<P>
Was that all there is? 
</P>
<P>
With one last hiccup -- try perhaps the worst game ever played by their special 
teams -- the Raiders once again squandered what riches they possess and what 
gallantry they could summon and fell Sunday by a resounding 34-17 to a real 
playoff team, the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
The team that had never been out of the playoffs in back-to-back seasons before 
1987 is out for the fourth season in a row, another new low in the Al Davis 
era. 
</P>
<P>
What's one more disappointing finish? The news lies in Davis' impending choice 
of sites. Oakland? Sacramento? Will there ever be a Los Angeles Raiders again? 
</P>
<P>
Before the game, Davis told to NBC that he'll decide soon. 
</P>
<P>
"We certainly have need for an intimate stadium," Davis said. "We need the roar 
of the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
He also managed to get the phrase "greatness of the Raiders" in four times, by 
actual count of a team official, and said he still hoped to "finish on a high 
note in the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
But then the Raiders ran their first play and Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor 
blew past lineman Steve Wright and landed atop quarterback Steve Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders ran seven plays from scrimmage before ever gaining a yard. They 
also punted once in that stretch and watched the Giants' Dave Meggett return it 
76 yards for a touchdown, making five Raiders miss, or bounce off. The game was 
4:55 old before they gained a yard or made a tackle. 
</P>
<P>
They came back behind the promising Beuerlein to actually dominate the first 
half, but had only a 17-17 tie after their special teams committed the 
following gaffes: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The 76-yard punt return by Meggett. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A 43-yard kickoff return by Meggett with 1:02 left in the first half, 
setting up a tying field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kerry Porter's attempt to pick up and run with a Giant fumble at the New 
York 10 instead of just falling on it. Instead Meggett recovered. 
</P>
<P>
More goofs awaited in the second half, including the piece de resistance: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Stefon Adams fielding Sean Landeta's punt at his own two-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
Adams returned the ball to the 8. An illegal block brought it back to the 
Raider 4. On second-and-eight, Bo Jackson burst 15 yards up the middle and out 
of danger, but a holding call on Bruce Wilkerson brought that back, too. 
</P>
<P>
They wound up punting to their own 39. Ten plays later, running back Ottis 
Anderson went the last yard for a touchdown and lead that was never lost. 
</P>
<P>
A return man is never supposed to field the ball inside his own 10. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just a mistake," said Coach Art Shell. "Those things happen in the 
course of the game." 
</P>
<P>
"He (Landeta) just got a good hit on it and I just lost track of where I was," 
Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
With the temperature falling and the windchill minus-6 by halftime -- the 
Raiders did what marginal teams do. 
</P>
<P>
They went bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants scored on three straight possessions. 
</P>
<P>
The venerable Anderson rolled up 74 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
Simms, who started with four incompletions and a sack, finished seven for 12 
and scored his first rushing touchdown in three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders never again crossed midfield until the Giants led, 34-17. 
</P>
<P>
It only makes it crueler that the other results the Raiders needed to make the 
playoffs were on track. 
</P>
<P>
They required losses by the Colts and Bengals. Sure enough, the Colts got 
flattened in New Orleans, and the Bengals are six-point underdogs tonight in 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
"All along, this entire week, we talked about just going out and doing our own 
job and not being concerned about what the other teams did," said Raider 
running back Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
He laughed a short, bitter laugh. 
</P>
<P>
"The other teams lose and we don't take care of what we're supposed to do. And 
now we're not in it." 
</P>
<P>
Not that they didn't try everything. 
</P>
<P>
Davis left his seat in the press box in the third period -- perchance for the 
coaches' booth to help with the play-calling? 
</P>
<P>
But the immediate future of the Raiders was carved in granite. 
</P>
<P>
For all sad words of tongue or pen, 
</P>
<P>
 The saddest are these: 
</P>
<P>
 It might have been. 
</P>
<P>
Those words by John Greenleaf Whittier, not "Pride and Poise" or "Commitment to 
Excellence" describe the Raiders, circa 1986-89. 
</P>
<P>
Now let's see who gets this dynasty for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
Steve Beuerlein withstood a fierce rush that sacked him four times and knocked 
him out for one play to perform admirably. A writer asked him if he'd taken a 
beating. "That's an understatement," murmured backup quarterback Jay Schroeder. 
. . . Beuerlein picked up a third-and-17 situation with a 23-yard pass to Mike 
Alexander in the first scoring drive, finishing it with a one-yard toss to 
Ethan Horton. Beuerlein marched them to the Giant 13 on their next possession 
before Mervyn Fernandez fumbled after a catch. On their next possession, 
Beuerlein was knocked out of the game by a crushing Pepper Johnson hit, 
returned one play later and threw a 30-yard TD pass to Fernandez. On the next 
possession, he picked up a third-and-22 situation with a 34-yard pass to 
Alexander, setting up Jeff Jaeger's field goal for a 17-14 lead. . . . 
Beuerlein, on the Johnson hit: "Guy hit me just under the rib cage, knocked the 
air out of me. That's the worst feeling in the world. You know you're not hurt, 
but you can't move and you can't talk. I was trying to squirm around to let 
some air back in." Sounds like fun. 
</P>
<P>
Fernandez had six catches for 125 yards and finishes with 57 for 1,069. He's 
the first Raider wide receiver to gain 1,000 yards since Cliff Branch in 1976. 
. . . Bo Jackson was held to 35 yards in 10 carries, finished with 950 in his 
11 games and a 5.5 average. For his career, he's at 5.3. . . . The 32-year-old 
Ottis Anderson's 74 yards give him 1,023. His 3.1 average is the lowest of any 
1,000 rusher ever, beating the previous low, Joe Morris' 3.5 in 1988.

PERFECTION IS ALWAYS HIS GAME; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER UCLA ASSISTANT HOMER SMITH, NOW WITH ALABAMA, IS ONE 
OF THE KEYS TO A 10-1 RECORD FOR SUGAR BOWL-BOUND CRIMSON TIDE. 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wee, silent hours of Dec. 1, Homer Smith, his face flushed with fever 
and sweat, awoke from a troubled sleep. The alarm clock read 4 a.m. -- only 33 
hours before his Alabama offense would face Auburn in a game that would have 
national championship ramifications. For Smith, the Crimson Tide's offensive 
coordinator, it might as well have been 33 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
His mind raced. What had he forgotten? What key detail had he inadvertently 
ignored? 
</P>
<P>
X's and O's swirled about. His head ached. His skin was hot to the touch, but 
yet, he wasn't really ill. In essence, Smith had worried himself sick. 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Kathy, whom he had met 42 years ago at Benson High in Omaha, Neb., 
knew what had happened. Nerves. And the obsession. Her husband didn't just 
strive for perfection, he craved it. It was both his blessing and curse. 
</P>
<P>
She took Smith's temperature. It was 101 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, my gosh," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Then she thought of Norman Cousins, an author and lecturer whose works detailed 
the use of laughter and humor as a healing therapy. Cousins is on the faculty 
of UCLA's School of Medicine. It was during Smith's stay as an assistant coach 
on Terry Donahue's Bruin staff that he had come to admire Cousins' writings. 
</P>
<P>
"You know what Norman Cousins says about the mind," Kathy Smith told her 
husband. "You just tell your mind to make you well." 
</P>
<P>
So he did. Two hours later, his temperature had returned to normal. Anxiety had 
lost this one. But when would the obsession come calling again? 
</P>
<P>
For as long as anyone can remember, Smith has been infatuated by football's 
reluctance to be tamed by any one system, coach or player. He searches for the 
perfectly played game in a sport that features an oblong ball and imperfect 
bounces. 
</P>
<P>
His boss, Alabama Coach Bill Curry, calls Smith "the finest offensive mind in 
the country." And perhaps the most driven, too. Curry, who earned a pair of 
Super Bowl rings as a player for the Green Bay Packers and Baltimore Colts, can 
name only one other coach who rivaled Smith in the mental preparation for a 
game: a gap-toothed, former offensive lineman named Vince Lombardi. 
</P>
<P>
Frank Gansz lured Smith from UCLA to the Kansas City Chiefs in 1987. He offered 
the prestige of the NFL, a title of offensive coordinator and a $35,000 raise. 
And even though the Chiefs struggled, Gansz said it was some of the best money 
the franchise ever spent. 
</P>
<P>
"(Smith is) the type of coach who really sets the standards for people who want 
to be coaches," said Gansz, who now coaches the Detroit Lions' special teams. 
"He's committed to the highest standards of excellence in the profession." 
</P>
<P>
No wonder Smith can send the mercury zooming toward thermometer's tip. How 
would you like to be the standard bearer of a business that majors in paranoia 
and insecurity? Then again, Smith has been preparing for the honor, whether he 
knew it or not, since his days at Benson High. 
</P>
<P>
ATTENTION TO DETAIL 
</P>
<P>
Smith, who has helped Alabama earn a 10-1 record and a bid to the Sugar Bowl 
where it plays 10-1 Miami, always has been a detail man. His closet at home 
looks as if a butler had spent the weekend tidying it up. His shoes are set 
just so. His shirts and pants hang an inch apart. His garage is, as garages go, 
neat and ordered. His coaching attire -- Alabama sweatshirt, Crimson polyester 
pants -- looks pressed. Smith figures that if he preaches exactness, he must 
live it, too. 
</P>
<P>
And about that preaching . . . 
</P>
<P>
Smith may be the only major college coach to include on his resume a degree 
from the Harvard Divinity School. In a perfect -- there's that word again -- 
world, Smith said he would like nothing better than "to coach football in the 
afternoon, be a professor in the morning and take my wife out in the evening." 
One dimensional, he isn't. A stickler for exactitude, well, there you've got 
him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an obsession," Kathy Smith said. "When things don't go right, it upsets 
him terribly." 
</P>
<P>
At UCLA, his players called him "My Favorite Martian," a reference to his 
slightly eccentric ways. 
</P>
<P>
On one occasion, Smith walked into a quarterbacks meeting with his shirt 
buttoned wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"Uh, Coach, I think you missed something," a player said. 
</P>
<P>
As the players giggled nervously, Smith fumbled about, trying to figure the 
best way to correct the mistake. Then he turned to his captivated audience and 
offered a lesson. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason the buttons are out of order at the top is because I got started 
wrong at the bottom," he said. "If you get started wrong at the base, then you 
can't do anything about correcting it at the top." 
</P>
<P>
Silly, simple, but effective. Smith's players got the message. 
</P>
<P>
And it was no coincidence that when Smith met his Alabama players in 1988, he 
arrived with his shirt buttoned wrong. 
</P>
<P>
During the first workout he conducted at Alabama, he replaced a quarterback in 
a drill simply because the player didn't properly enunciate his words. Smith 
wants his quarterbacks to make two syllables out of one. "Down, set," becomes 
"Dow-nnn, se-eeet." 
</P>
<P>
And pity the player who doesn't line up exactly where Smith's formation 
requires him to be. In ballet, it is called first position, a term Smith now 
uses to describe where and when a tailback might go into motion, how a 
quarterback will stand under center, where a wide receiver will settle into his 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it is important to give them no choice in certain fundamentals," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
He applies the same standard to himself. After watching game films with his 
players, Smith often retires to the privacy of his office and watches them 
again, this time to grade his own efforts. More times than not, he leaves the 
screening unsatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
HITTING THE PERFECTA 
</P>
<P>
Occasionally, though, there are moments when performance flirts with 
perfection. Earlier this season, Alabama scored 62 points against a bowl-bound 
Mississippi team. It gained 644 net yards against LSU. It passed for 379 yards 
against 10-1 Tennessee. It did all of this with a quarterback, Gary 
Hollingsworth, and a running back, Siran Stacy, who were second-stringers at 
season's start. 
</P>
<P>
But it was at UCLA that Smith's system came closest to achieving what he had in 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
"When Rick Neuheisel hit 25 out of 27 passes (against Washington in 1983), that 
was close," he said. "That was a great day. And there have been quarters. The 
second quarter against Michigan in 1982 was a highlight film. All of a sudden 
it all happened, everything happened. Oh, yes, there have been times." 
</P>
<P>
But never enough to satisfy him. During his two- and seven-year stays at UCLA, 
the Bruins won a total of 76 games, including five consecutive bowl games, 
three of which included the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Ramsey led the nation in passing efficiency in 1982. Neuheisel set an NCAA 
single-game record for completion percentage in 1983. Steve Bono led UCLA to a 
wacky, memorable victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl the following season. 
David Norrie helped beat Iowa in the 1985 Rose Bowl. Matt Stevens gave the 
Bruins a 1986 Freedom Bowl win over BYU. 
</P>
<P>
Five winning seasons, five different quarterbacks, five bowl victories, dozens 
of school offensive records, one coach. 
</P>
<P>
But despite a string of heady successes, Smith wanted out of Westwood. Rumors 
persisted that he and Donahue were at odds with one another, that Donahue 
resented the attention Smith received. 
</P>
<P>
If so, it's news to Smith, who said he left because the Chiefs' offer was too 
good to refuse -- and because the Alabama offensive coordinator position was 
filled in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue was unavailable to comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss (UCLA)? Of course, I do," Smith said. "I've got blue and gold all over 
the place. I miss it very much." 
</P>
<P>
Smith rummaged through a pile of papers on his desk and found a photograph of 
Neuheisel. "See? It's just a shot of him making a good fake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Donahue also did his part to quell the reports of ill will. When asked if he 
could dispel the gossip once and for all, Donahue said it wasn't necessary. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't need to put it to rest," he said. "You need to have truth or 
credibility to have a rumor. This one had none of that. I think Homer Smith 
left because he had a chance to go to the NFL and make a lot more money than I 
was paying him. 
</P>
<P>
"But when he was here, he did a real good job." 
</P>
<P>
CHANGING ADDRESSES 
</P>
<P>
After a 4-11 season at Kansas City, Smith decided that a change in venues was 
in order. Maybe so, but Gansz insisted that Smith wasn't to blame for the 
Chiefs' dismal showing. 
</P>
<P>
"What can he do about it?" Gansz asked. "We had it going, we were 1-1 and then 
the teams went on strike. When players go on strike, they don't come back with 
any of the same enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
Without benefit of a 16th game and 104 fewer plays from scrimmage, Smith's 
offense managed to surpass the 1986 Chiefs' offense in first downs, rushing 
yards and total yards. Still, the Chiefs finished 24th in total offense. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought he did an outstanding job," Gansz said. "He did a real top-notch 
job." 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Perfection didn't think so. In fact, in a letter he recently sent to Gansz, 
Smith apologized, again, for his work in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
"It was extremely frustrating for me," Smith said. "I did not do a good job for 
Frank Gansz and I wanted to and will regret, every day that I live, that I did 
not do a better job." 
</P>
<P>
Curry came calling with an offer shortly after the 1987 season was completed. 
But he had first heard of Smith 19 years earlier, when he was a center for the 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
In training camp that summer was a Davidson College quarterback named Gordon 
Slade. Slade didn't have much chance of making the team, what with Johnny 
Unitas and Earl Morrall on the roster, but he did impress Curry with his 
knowledge of the game. Curry asked him who his coach had been. 
</P>
<P>
"Homer Smith," Slade said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, Georgia Tech Coach Pepper Rodgers gave Curry, then an assistant, a 
large, thick text book. 
</P>
<P>
"Study it and memorize it," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
Curry examined the cover. It was a tome on the intricacies of the wishbone 
offense. The author was Homer Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"I can still quote it," Curry said. "I remember all of it." 
</P>
<P>
Years later, when Curry had a chance to hire Smith, he hesitated just long 
enough to listen to a recommendation from, ta-da, Donahue. 
</P>
<P>
"(Donahue) said some amazing things about Homer's work with him, shocking 
things which I don't have his permission to repeat," Curry said. "They were all 
positive. When I learned that we might be able to attract him . . . I jumped at 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Said Donahue: "I just told Bill Curry that Homer Smith had done a fabulous job 
for us here at UCLA and that he was more capable of getting the most out of a 
football player than anybody I've been around. I thought if he could hire Homer 
Smith, he would really be happy with him." 
</P>
<P>
The courting process was unabashedly direct. 
</P>
<P>
"I begged. I recruited. I was so excited that he would even consider us that I 
flew to Kansas City," Curry said. "I would have done whatever I had to do, as 
long as it was legal, to get him here because I knew what he could do." 
</P>
<P>
Since Smith arrived at Tuscaloosa, Alabama is 19-4. Do we detect a pattern 
here? 
</P>
<P>
Curry, as you might expect, spread the praise among his other coaches when he 
listed the reasons for the Crimson Tide's success. Still, he admitted that 
Smith's value to his staff has been "incalculable." 
</P>
<P>
Smith said he doesn't understand what all the fuss is about. His methods aren't 
revolutionary. He stresses discipline. He demands concentration. He believes a 
point is best learned by repetition. What's so hard about that? 
</P>
<P>
"It has nothing to do with me seeing something that has not been seen 
previously by other coaches," he said. "I can almost remember when and where I 
stole each of the ideas that I use. In business, they would call it stealing. 
In academics, they would call it plagiarism. In coaching, they would call it 
research." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever it is, it works for Smith. It had better work. Smith isn't one to 
accept failure gently. 
</P>
<P>
And as you might remember, Auburn beat Alabama that next day. The loss not only 
ended the Crimson Tide's hopes for a national title, but deprived Smith of what 
he wants most -- a perfect season.

GIANTS: HE SCORES ON A 76-YARD PUNT RETURN, SETS UP A FIELD GOAL WITH A 43-YARD 
KICKOFF RETURN AND RUNS THE RAIDERS OUT OF THE PLAYOFFS.

Tailback Dave Meggett of the New York Giants was overcome with emotion as he 
ran through the tunnel that leads to the dressing rooms after the Giants beat 
the Raiders, 34-17, to win the NFC East championship. 
</P>
<P>
"Way to go Giants!" Meggett shouted as he made his way out of the freezing 
afternoon and into the warmth of the Giant clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
A speedy, compact (5 feet 7, 180 pounds) rookie running back, Meggett helped to 
spark the Giants, returning a punt 76 yards for New York's first touchdown. He 
also returned a kickoff 43 yards to set up a field goal that tied the score, 
17-17, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got to be somewhat of a psycho to be a punt returner and that's 
Meggett," Giant running back Ottis Anderson said. "He believes in himself. He 
believes that every time he touches the football he can make something happen." 
</P>
<P>
Meggett made things happen the first time he touched the ball, eluding what 
seemed like the entire Raider punt team on his 76-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Fielding the kick at the 24, Meggett cut left and eluded Raider cornerback Dan 
Land. He juked Raider running back Steve Smith by cutting inside and bounced 
off punter Jeff Gossett. Raider defenders Kerry Porter and Vance Mueller also 
missed shots at him. The Giants mobbed him in the end zone, piling on top of 
him. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett credited his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
"Our return team did a great job," Meggett said. "They created a lot of seams 
for me. It was just up to me to get to the seams. To get to the seams I broke 
four tackles. I did what I had to do. 
</P>
<P>
"When I broke the last tackle there was a wide opening and the blockers just 
escorted me to the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
Land thought he should have stopped Maggett. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a good shot at him," Land said. "But my responsibility is to contain the 
outside so I broke down and when I broke down he cut around me and it was too 
late. I knew he was quick but I didn't think he could get outside me." 
</P>
<P>
Why did the Raiders have such a difficult time containing Meggett, who returned 
five punts for 114 yards? 
</P>
<P>
"When he gets the ball the first thing he does is come at you," Land said. "And 
when he comes at you he's going to freeze you. And he's got the quickness to 
get by you. 
</P>
<P>
"He's comes straight at you then goes around you. Most punt returners catch the 
ball and go wherever they're going. But he'll come at you and then he'll make 
his break. That's what makes him so hard to catch. He makes the first guy miss 
and then he relies on his blocking." 
</P>
<P>
Voted to the Pro Bowl, Meggett is one of the top kick returners in the NFC. He 
finished the season with 582 yards on 46 punt returns to break a 38-year-old 
team record for most punt return yardage in a season. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett's response when informed that he'd broken the record set by Emlen 
Tunnell: "Who's Emlen Tunnell? I've got a plane to catch." 
</P>
<P>
With that he was gone, dashing into the night in a black leather trench coat 
and a matching black leather baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
A fifth-round draft pick from Towson State, Meggett was almost on the first 
plane home after fumbling two punts because he lost them in the lights in his 
first exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
Meggett felt he was going to be cut after his awful debut, but Coach Bill 
Parcells reassured him that he was going to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
His confidence restored, Meggett broke a punt return for 45 yards in his second 
exhibition game. And the Giants cut Phil McConkey, a popular journeyman wide 
receiver/punt returner, to make room for Meggett. 
</P>
<P>
"Meggett gives us a new dimension to our team that we haven't had in the past," 
said Lawrence Taylor, Giant linebacker. "He's got speed and quickness out of 
the backfield. Every defensive player has to worry about him because he can 
break it every time he touches the football. I was very happy that he had a 
chance to break one today because he's worked very hard." 
</P>
<P>
Does Meggett have more confidence now than he did at the start of the season? 
</P>
<P>
"I feel great about myself," Meggett said. "Sixteen weeks ago I felt great 
about myself. I felt great about myself 900 years ago. As the season progresses 
you get more and more of a feel for the game because you get more NFL 
experience. But hey, I felt good about myself when I was 3 or 4 years old." 
</P>
<P>
Meggett has also been adept at turning routine passes into big plays. Meggett 
turned a screen pass into a 62-yard touchdown to help break open the Giants' 
27-24 season-opening win over the Washington Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
On a third-and-31 play, Meggett turned a dump pass from quarterback Phil Simms 
into a 57-yard touchdown to lift the Giants to a 14-7 victory at Denver two 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been the one single biggest surprise on the team this year," Simms said 
of Meggett. "He's just done a lot of things for us. Today he was just 
magnificent. It was the best I've ever seen him." 
</P>
<P>
While Meggett has made some big plays, scoring four touchdowns of more than 50 
yards this season, he's had problems fumbling. He has fumbled seven times this 
season, losing five, including one which led to the Raiders' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants feel that too much emphasis has been placed on Meggett's fumbles. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got a guy who's only 175 pounds and you've got guys hitting you, 
you're going to fumble," said New York fullback Maurice Carthon. "If I was like 
him I would have coughed it up too. He makes big plays and all those (fumbles) 
don't mean anything. He's made more good plays than bad plays and that's the 
way we look at it. We don't look at how many times he's fumbled. He's done 
positive things for us. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad I don't have to run down and cover kicks when this guy is running the 
ball. He's eludes people and breaks tackles and he's strong. He does a 
tremendous job on punt returns." 
</P>
<P>
After Meggett ran them out of the playoffs, the Raiders concurred.

ROBIN ROMEO HAS HER GAME ROLLING NOW; 
</P>
<P>
BOWLING: SHE WON A NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP AND FOUR OTHER TITLES. NOW SOME 
YEAR-END AWARDS ARE EXPECTED TO COME HER WAY, TOO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Bowler Robin Romeo started 1989 with dim prospects. She awoke in early January 
to find that she couldn't raise her bowling arm. The doctor called it a slight 
shoulder separation, caused by a bump or a pull. 
</P>
<P>
After a three-week layoff from the lanes, her fortunes took off in the other 
direction. She won the national championship, had the most titles, set the 
all-time single-year high earnings record and had two performance streaks that 
also are records in women's pro competition. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the best of years," she said in her trophy-filled Van Nuys living room. 
</P>
<P>
Things can even get better. 
</P>
<P>
The award for U.S. woman bowler of the year is within reach. Selection to this 
honor by the Bowling Writers Assn. of America is to be announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy of Sports lists her among finalists for U.S. woman athlete 
of the year. 
</P>
<P>
On the 1989 tournament trail, the 5-foot-4 Romeo won the Canoga Park Classic, 
the San Diego Classic, the Fairlanes Open at Washington D.C., the Midwest Open 
at Rockford, Ill., and the U.S. Open at Addison, Ill. The latter is symbolic of 
the national individual championship in bowling. 
</P>
<P>
Her five titles led the LPBT cross-country tour. She finished with earnings of 
$113,550 to break Lisa Wagner's single-year record of $105,500, set in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Only Romeo and Wagner, of Palmetto, Fla., have won more than $100,000 during a 
year in women's pro bowling. Romeo's 210 average (for 1,000 games) was second 
to Wagner's 211 average (934 games) in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
A record pro streak of cashing in 80 consecutive tour tournaments is still 
alive for Romeo. Her record of making 77 straight pro tournament finals, a 
streak that started in 1984, was broken this year when she missed the cut at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo has been Southern California woman bowler of the year four consecutive 
years but never did so many of biggest and best things happen. 
</P>
<P>
She talked about "a new surge of confidence to win" and blanking out thoughts 
of making mistakes -- like rushing a step, allowing a wrong fractional turn of 
the hand at delivery or letting a distraction spoil concentration. 
</P>
<P>
She spoke of humming inside her head to chase away distractions. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember early in the year at Canoga Park Bowl, a critical point in a match. 
I had to have a strike. When a sharp sound came out of the crowd that could 
have spoiled my concentration, I strangely and suddenly began to quietly hum 
'Two Hearts.' It's the one Phil Collins sings. It relaxed me. I got that 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
Romeo said she has been humming "Two Hearts" in every tournament since. And 
"Nothing Is Going To Stop Us Now," from the movie "Mannequin," recently joined 
her repertoire for use in the heat of competition. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo is Brooklyn born. Ray and Joan Romeo raised and schooled their daughter 
in Mamaronek and had her bowling at 6 in nearby New Rochelle. At 10, she won a 
New York state junior title. 
</P>
<P>
At 13, she partnered with world-record setter Bev Ortner in a pro-junior am 
event and "I was so impressed it was after that I decided on wanting one day to 
be a professional bowler though I was averaging only 169 and hadn't yet scored 
a 200 game in competition." 
</P>
<P>
At 18, she averaged 200 in league for the first time, then at 19 joined the 
Women's All-Star Assn., winning a WASA title against top East Coast bowlers 
before the family moved to Southern California in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo was an instant winner on the California-based Worldwide Women Pro Bowlers 
tour. The first of her 12 career titles on the national pro tour was in 1981 at 
Bradenton, Fla. She rolled 26 consecutive strikes to set a women's world record 
in 1982 and became the first woman to score more than one 800 series (three 
games). Her 216 average in 1984 set a world's individual mark for a trio 
league. 
</P>
<P>
Major triumphs kept coming here and there -- in 1986 winning the WIBC (Women's 
International Bowling Congress) Queens Classic and the prestigious WIBC 
All-events, in 1987 setting the WIBC Tournament doubles record with Connecticut 
partner Laura Grant. 
</P>
<P>
Romeo, who has bowled 12 perfect games in her career, has two brothers and two 
sisters, one of whom is Tori, 27, who joined the national pro tour this year. 
</P>
<P>
Tori, a leading candidate for 1989 LPBT rookie of the year, travels the tour 
with Robin in the latter's van. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gone a good many miles across the country to tournaments," Robin said. 
"Only the other day, I drove to a stop at Sepulveda and Victory and was singing 
my favorite tune out the window. The driver next to me gave me a strange look. 
He didn't know how important 'Two Hearts' is to me."

NEWSWIRE: BILL WALSH SPURNS JOB WITH JETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Former San Francisco 49er coach Bill Walsh told the New York Jets he is not 
interested in coaching the team, which is expected to fire Coach Joe Walton 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Dick Steinberg, the Jets' new general manager, said Sunday he has discussed the 
Jets' coaching job with Walsh, an analyst with NBC. Walsh was in New York 
Saturday for the Jet-Buffalo Bill game at Giants Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
"I asked Bill if he had any interest in returning to coaching," Steinberg said. 
"He likes what he's doing now and wants to make a go of it." 
</P>
<P>
Steinberg is scheduled to meet with Walton Tuesday, at which time he is 
expected to announce Walton's departure. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh recommended his former offensive coordinator, Mike Holmgren, and 
Cincinnati offensive coordinator Bruce Coslet as possible replacements for 
Walton, and Steinberg said: "Those two guys will go right on our list because I 
respect Bill's opinion." 
</P>
<P>
Walton, 54-59-1 in seven years with the Jets, declined to talk about his future 
after Saturday's 37-0 loss to the Bills. 
</P>
<P>
Jet wide receiver Al Toon said Walton spoke to the team earlier. "He talked for 
22 minutes," Toon said. "He thanked us for all the work we've done. He wished 
us a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. Then he said goodby."

PANAMA: THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; 
</P>
<P>
BUSH PLEASED, BUT PLOY MAY FORCE STALEMATE 
</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush said Sunday that he is pleased that Manuel A. Noriega sought 
refuge in the Vatican embassy in Panama, declaring that it means that the 
dictator's "reign of terror is over." But the wily general's move poses 
potentially awkward problems for his pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
In a worst-case scenario, officials said, it could produce a long and 
embarrassing diplomatic stalemate that might result in his escape to another 
country. 
</P>
<P>
"I am pleased that the general is now under the control of diplomatic 
authorities. His reign of terror is over," Bush said in a statement released by 
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. "As we work to help return law and 
order to Panama City, and as the government of President (Guillermo) Endara 
begins its work, the demise of Gen. Noriega sends a strong signal that freedom 
and democracy in Panama are on the rise." 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater said the Administration is asking the Vatican to turn Noriega over to 
U.S. or Panamanian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"The United States will continue to pursue avenues to bringing Gen. Noriega, 
now located, to justice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said officials are discussing how best to obtain the Vatican's agreement. 
"That's what we're considering right now," he said. ". . . We have been in 
touch with a number of officials relevant to this." 
</P>
<P>
Under international law, embassies and other diplomatic missions have the right 
to grant asylum to dissidents or others who seek refuge; U.S. forces cannot 
pursue Noriega onto the embassy's premises. 
</P>
<P>
But the Vatican's response was far from certain. According to an Italian news 
agency report from Panama, the papal nuncio in Panama City, Bishop Jose 
Sebastian Laboa, had already refused to turn Noriega over to the U.S. armed 
forces who invaded the country last week. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be a night of many questions and no answers," a weary White 
House official said. "Everything remains open. We just want to bring him to 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
"There have been contacts on (several) levels between the U.S. and Vatican 
officials in Washington as well as in Rome," a State Department official said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't expect a third country deal (under which Noriega would find refuge in 
another country) to emerge," he said. "We expect that the Pope may have to be 
in on the decision-making process." 
</P>
<P>
He indicated that the Administration will try to persuade the pontiff that 
Noriega's case "is different from other cases because it is not political, he 
is not being persecuted for political reasons. He is a criminal just out to 
save his skin." 
</P>
<P>
The Pope himself did not hear the news of Noriega's arrival on his doorstep 
until after celebrating Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica in the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing to say. Later today, we shall see," said Vatican spokesman 
Joaquin Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Tradition might sway the Vatican to allow Noriega to escape. Vatican and other 
foreign embassies in Latin America have been confronted by dozens of asylum 
requests during the wars and revolutions of the past decade, and their most 
frequent response has been to arrange safe passage out of the country. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has already been offered asylum in two countries, the Dominican 
Republic and Spain, although those offers were made before the U.S. invasion of 
Panama last week. In 1988, the Reagan Administration offered the general safe 
passage to one of those countries if he would voluntarily relinquish power, an 
offer Noriega walked away from. 
</P>
<P>
The issue is complicated by the fact that the United States is asking for 
Noriega to be handed over to U.S. authorities for trial before a federal court 
in Florida -- not to Panamanian authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not clear exactly what the situation is, either diplomatically or 
legally, at this time," said David Runkel, a special assistant to Atty. Gen. 
Dick Thornburgh. "Our interest remains the same -- bringing this man to trial 
in the United States if that's possible." 
</P>
<P>
However, earlier Sunday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney raised the possibility 
that the United States might agree to allow Noriega to be prosecuted in Panama 
instead. Panama normally does not allow its citizens to be extradited to the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
"If he were to be captured in Panama and arrested, then I suppose we'd have to 
sit down at that point and decide whether he was going to be brought back to 
the United States, extradited if you will, or whether he would be prosecuted in 
Panama," Cheney said on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley." 
</P>
<P>
Much will depend on the attitude of the Endara government, officials said. The 
Vatican was one of the first countries to extend tacit recognition to the 
Endara government; the papal nuncio, Bishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, met with 
Endara last week. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Endara himself took refuge at the nuncio's residence until shortly 
before the U.S. invasion last week. 
</P>
<P>
Even if Noriega settles in for a long stay, some State Department officials 
consoled themselves with the thought that it might be better than the 
alternative. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at it this way," said one. "It's not the worst-case scenario. He could be 
out in the hills, leading a guerrilla movement of resistance against the U.S. 
occupation. This way, at least he's admitted that he's a fugitive from 
justice." 
</P>
<P>
A group of senior State Department officials was meeting Sunday evening to 
consider the Administration's legal and diplomatic options, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The officials reportedly included Undersecretary of State Robert M. Kimmitt, 
Assistant Secretary of State Bernard W. Aronson and Legal Adviser Abraham 
Sofaer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the Christmas holiday, President Bush and his senior advisers were 
out of Washington, with Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Md., 
and Secretary of State James A. Baker III visiting his family in Houston. 
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney was visiting American troops in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The United States has frequently extended asylum in its embassies to prominent 
dissidents in Communist countries -- sometimes for long periods. Chinese 
dissident Fang Lizhi has been living in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since June, 
although Chinese authorities seek him for treason. In the 1950s, the U.S. 
Embassy in Budapest, Hungary, sheltered Cardinal Josef Mindszenty, the Catholic 
primate of Hungary, for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
The concept of diplomatic asylum is different from the sanctuary that churches 
provided to fugitives in medieval days. Asylum in embassies in generally 
provided solely to political dissidents. "The ancient concept is that a church 
provides sanctuary." said the Rev. George Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal 
Church in Pasadena, who has been active in the modern sanctuary movement, 
providing shelter to emigrants from Central America. 
</P>
<P>
"It usually is not sanctuary for someone fleeing from the law as it is for 
someone who is obeying a higher law out of conscience. Noriega does not fit 
that bill, I don't think. So the church would have to decide on what grounds it 
would give sanctuary. It's a very complicated legal issue."

TREE BECOMES SYMBOL OF NEW LIFE FOR PANAMANIANS

<TEXT>
<P>
Among the 12,000 refugees camped on blankets and cardboard at Balboa High 
School, a wiry man in Bermuda shorts squatted over his foot-high coconut palm 
Sunday to hang an array of makeshift Christmas ornaments. 
</P>
<P>
The unemployed machinist had lost his home and everything in it to fire ignited 
by a U.S. air strike last week, but he was determined not to lose out on a 
Christmas tree. Among the decorations he strung were condiments from a U.S. 
Army rations package, a paper cup and Camel cigarette wrappers. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to celebrate Christmas," said Cristobal Colon -- the name Christopher 
Columbus used in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether things are good or bad, whether we have anything or not, we always 
celebrate Christmas," he added as his neighbors crowded around. 
</P>
<P>
Even under normal circumstances, a steamy Christmas in the tropics is an 
incongruous event. But after a U.S. invasion to oust Panamanian strongman 
Manuel A. Noriega, the holiday seemed both sad and surreal. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. soldiers on patrol downtown dripped with perspiration under the weight of 
their flak jackets and camouflage uniforms as they reminisced about winters 
back home. At the headquarters of the new, U.S.-installed government, Sgt. 
Richard Ellis manned an M-60 machine gun from the turret of an armored 
personnel carrier and peered at the pictures of his three children taped in the 
window. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at them every day, all the time," said Ellis, 30, of Canton, Mass. 
"Christmas is for kids and it turns you into a big juvenile. You get down and 
play, and when that gets taken away, it bothers me." 
</P>
<P>
Nearby, at a concertina-shaped, barbed-wire barricade, Staff Sgt. Lionel San 
Jose said he received a picture of his first son for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of hard for me because we just had a little boy two weeks before I 
came here," said San Jose, 31, of Los Angeles. "But a lot of the Panamanian 
people were happy to see us here and that makes us feel better." 
</P>
<P>
The soldiers, who arrived in October and hope to leave by February, said they 
had received candy cane from the base and stockings from home. And, at the 
headquarters of the U.S. Southern Command, hundreds of packages addressed to 
"any American GI," arrived by airlift from the United States. 
</P>
<P>
But Christmas dinner was to be a brown plastic bag of K-rations -- officially 
known as "Meals Ready to Eat," but widely disparaged as "Meals Rejected 
Everywhere." The likely fare: corned beef hash or tuna with noodles. 
</P>
<P>
Good-natured Panamanians also joked Sunday that there were "no more looting 
days until Christmas," after almost all of the major warehouses and department 
stores had been sacked. 
</P>
<P>
In poor housing projects, meanwhile, kids could be seen playing with brand new 
soccer balls and listening to fancy cassette players. 
</P>
<P>
At Noriega's private residence in the swank suburb of San Francisco, members of 
the 82nd Airborne Division slouched in wicker chairs beside the ousted 
dictator's Christmas tree, which was adorned with white ribbons and blonde 
dolls. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas ornaments broken in the U.S. assault littered the ground in front of 
Noriega's old office at Ft. Amador, a base shared by U.S. and Panamanian 
forces; unopened presents to the general were stacked inside. A banner on the 
American half of the base read, "Felices Pascuas -- Merry Christmas." The 
message on the Panamanian side: "Welcome To Those Who Bring Peace." 
</P>
<P>
As word of Noriega's surrender spread at nightfall on Christmas Eve, 
Panamanians turned out on the balconies and in the streets to cheer and bang on 
pots, an act that once symbolized opposition to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"No more Noriega," they shouted gleefully. "Merry Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
In the Balboa refugee camp, dreams were larger than life for some of the newly 
homeless. Celina Rivera, 58, applauded the U.S. invasion that leveled her 
shanty home and said she looked upon President Bush as Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
"Bush said he is going to give each of us a chalet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, with a swimming pool," chimed in a laughing youth. 
</P>
<P>
Down the way, past the camouflaged "Porta-potties," children and adults 
gathered around Colon's Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
"Houses and clothes are material," said Celia White, who lost all of hers. 
"What is important is our spirit to struggle and get ahead." 
</P>
<P>
Colon, 42, sprinkled rice and lentils under the tree, where he had laid 
offerings of bread and orange and egg -- "so that they will never be scarce." 
</P>
<P>
He said the tree was a symbol in the aftermath of the invasion -- "because I am 
not dead," he said. "Because I am alive."

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manuel Antonio Noriega, ousted as Panama's dictator five days ago by a U.S. 
invasion force, surrendered Sunday to the Vatican's embassy here and asked for 
sanctuary from his American pursuers. 
</P>
<P>
The development sparked a spontaneous demonstration of pot-banging and 
horn-honking elation as the news spread quickly through the city. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender came near the end of a day that for the first time since 
the U.S. invasion began was unmarred by reports of serious violence. 
</P>
<P>
Archbishop Marcos G. McGrath, Panama's Roman Catholic primate, told reporters 
that Noriega "simply drove up in a private car and asked for political asylum." 
</P>
<P>
An American official, speaking on condition that he not be identified by name, 
added that Noriega rang the bell on the ornate iron gate of the papal 
nunciature, as the embassy is formally known, at 3:36 p.m. Noriega said he was 
seeking protection and ultimately wants political asylum to be arranged in 
either Cuba or Spain. 
</P>
<P>
He was then escorted through the yellow wall that surrounds the Victorian 
mansion housing the embassy by Father Joseph Esspeteri, secretary to the papal 
nuncio, Bishop Jose Sebastian Laboa. 
</P>
<P>
The papal envoy did not immediately announce that Noriega's request had been 
granted, but church officials and U.S. sources said they understood that it 
would be. 
</P>
<P>
At the Vatican, the news arrived a few minutes before Pope John Paul II 
celebrated his traditional Midnight Mass at St. Peter's Basilica. "There is 
nothing to say. Later today, we shall see," said Vatican spokesman Joaquin 
Navarro. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish diplomats here would not comment, but the Spanish ambassador was 
reported to be in close touch with Madrid, awaiting instructions. The Cuban 
embassy did not answer its phone. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega has successfully eluded the Americans from the moment U.S. troops 
attacked and burned his military headquarters and sacked his various homes in 
Panama City in the early morning hours of Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Although he was deemed responsible for directing a series of hit-and-run 
attacks that harassed and frustrated American forces in 
</P>
<P>
the first days after the invasion, Noriega's hope of survival dissolved as his 
allies increasingly deserted him and U.S. troops gradually gained control of 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
That dwindling support and indications that U.S. agents were about to close in 
on his hiding place in Panama City prompted his surrender, European diplomats 
said, an assessment confirmed by a U.S. military source with a curt grunt of 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, one U.S. commando unit was hot on his trail Sunday. When its members 
burst into a villa a mile from the Marriott Hotel, a few miles east of downtown 
Panama City, they found two women cooking a Chistmas turkey and evidence that 
the dictator had been there only 90 minutes earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Lt. Col. Harry Axson of the 82nd Airborne Division, Ft. Bragg, N.C., who led 
the 2 p.m. raid, said the women were Noriega's mistress and her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"They told us he was going to turn himself in. . . . They told us he was 
thinking of turning himself in," Axson said. 
</P>
<P>
The officer said he had no doubt that the raiders had just missed Noriega. 
Neighbors confirmed that a helicopter had lifted off from the villa grounds 
just an 90 minutes earlier. That was just after a surveillance team, acting on 
a tip, had approached the plush villa in a heavily wooded area and had decided 
to get reinforcements before launching a raid. 
</P>
<P>
Axson said the surveillance party had gathered at the Marriott in the morning 
after being tipped that Noriega was nearby. The four-man commando team was sent 
to the villa soon after noon in a hotel vehicle that looked like a small moving 
van. When they returned to fetch back-up, they were sent out in the same van 
with 25 members of the 82nd Airborne, who then stormed the house, Axxon said. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official here, when asked if Noriega had made a good move, answered 
that, "It was the only move. He had nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's surrender met the most important of the American policy demands set 
in 1987 when the man who had been personally honored by two U.S. presidents as 
a loyal and dedicated friend was cast adrift because of his major role in the 
international drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
Even though Noriega was indicted by two federal grand juries in Florida, 
Washington officials found the criminal charges to be impeding their real 
objective, that of ending his political and military control here. 
</P>
<P>
That view was expounded Sunday by a U.S. official. "Sure, we would have been 
happy to try him," he said, "but this (his surrender) is positive. It is good 
news. Noriega is out of circulation and that is the key." 
</P>
<P>
He explained that the three crucial aims of U.S. policy were "one, (get) 
Noriega out of power; No. 2, out of circulation; and No. 3, he's going to be 
(stay) out of power." 
</P>
<P>
This official and military sources denied suggestions that the United States 
had botched its effort to apprehend Noriega by not staking out the Vatican's 
embassy, as they had done the Cuban and Nicaraguan embassies here. 
</P>
<P>
They also rejected any suggestion that they could simply enter the Vatican 
territory and seize Noriega. "If this were the Rwandan embassy, you'd say 
'Screw them.' But you're not going to do that with the Vatican," said one 
official. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, they said, the U.S. strategy was to provide Noriega with an incentive 
to do exactly as he did by signaling that the relatively lenient treatment 
accorded his previous allies would be applied in some form or another to him. 
</P>
<P>
In a meeting between the papal envoy and U.S. officials two days ago, a 
conscious decision was reached to be as non-threatening as possible, Western 
diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
It was hoped that as former Panama Defense Force officers turned themselves in 
and were treated lightly, Noriega would realize both that he had no viable 
support and that the American goal was to get rid of him, not to send him to 
prison in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"The key thing was not to put up a threatening posture," one source said. "The 
big thing was to maintain public order by removing the one-time strongman as 
both a leader and inspiration of violent opposition." 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's fears may have been further eased by a statement earlier Sunday from 
the new Panamanian president, Guillermo Endara, who told a news conference that 
his American-sponsored government was not searching for the former dictator and 
would not 
</P>
<P>
extradite him to the United States if he were apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
"At this moment, we are not looking for him. We have other priorities," Endara 
said. He added that under the country's constitution, "we may not extradite any 
Panamanian citizen." 
</P>
<P>
In military action Sunday, U.S. troops discovered a cache of arms in a rented 
house near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of the city. 
Neighbors said the house had been rented by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Officials said the cache included 300 G-3 rifles, 72,000 rounds of ammunition, 
at least 360 concussion grenades, about 300 AK-47 assault rifles with 20,000 
rounds of ammunition and 30 light anti-tank weapons. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, three senior Panama Defense Forces officers turned themselves in 
to American troops. They were identified as Lt. Cols. Carlos Arosemena King, 
Daniel Delgado Diamante and Arnulfo Castrejon. 
</P>
<P>
Although the United States was apparently willing to allow Noriega to seek 
sanctuary in the Vatican's embassy, American authorities were determined that 
he not change his mind and walk out. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as American diplomats and officials were informed that Noriega was in 
the building, soldiers, a helicopter gunship, several light tanks and armored 
personnel carriers blocked the streets, sealing off the area at least four 
blocks away. 
</P>
<P>
The American soldiers, their faces totally covered with green camouflage paint 
and brandishing weapons from assault rifles to rocket launchers, prevented 
celebrating Panamanians from getting anywhere near Noriega's sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
"We secured the hell out of the place," said one American source. "He is not 
leaving without us knowing about." 
</P>
<P>
But as cheering, clapping citizens and frantic journalists gathered at the 
barricades, an American UH-1 Huey helicopter gunship lifted off from a vacant 
lot across the street from the mansion. It appeared to be an escort for a 
caravan of diplomatic cars, including one bearing a U.S. Embassy license plate, 
that emerged from the Vatican embassy compound. 
</P>
<P>
Speculation and rumor immediately had Noriega being kidnaped by the Americans. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, Laboa, as the senior serving diplomat in Panama, was to host 
a 4 p.m. reception for other envoys to meet the country's new foreign minister, 
Julio Linares. 
</P>
<P>
Laboa notified the invited guests, including American Ambassador Arthur Davis, 
but suggested that the meeting go on to avoid premature disclosure of Noriega's 
arrival. 
</P>
<P>
Davis declined, but he sent an armored embassy car as security for Linares. 
Other diplomats did attend. Diplomatically, they did not ask to see Noriega and 
left about 4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The city began its celebration as news of what had happened spread. People 
lined Via Argentina, a major Panama City thoroughfare, and stood on balconies 
to bang kitchen pots and cheer for the Americans who set off the chain of 
events with their invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now Panama can have a merry Christmas," one exultant Panamanian, Larry 
Larrinaga, exclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
"I am very happy for my country," said Ruben Carles, chairman 
</P>
<P>
of the board of directors of La Prensa, a liberal newspaper closed by Noriega 
for most of its eight-year existence. "We will now gain our goal of getting rid 
of the military system," he said. 
</P>
<P>
But some expressed another sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
"It would have been much better if he had shot himself or someone would have 
shot him," said a bitter businessman. 
</P>
<P>
But for the most part, the reaction was happy, the people looking forward 
rather than complaining about the Noriega past. 
</P>
<P>
In the provincial town of Penonome, 95 miles west of the capital, stores 
reopened to sell liquor to the people who filled the city's square and streets 
in wild celebration. 
</P>
<P>
As 120 U.S. soldiers stood guard over an equal number of captured Noriega 
military supporters, the people chanted their praise for the American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are broke this Christmas but thanks to you gringos, we can now be happy," 
said Isaac Guardia, a mechanic who says he was impoverished by Noriega's rule. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in Washington, President Bush declared himself very pleased with 
progress in the military situation in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very good pre-Christmas report that I have received," Bush said after a 
briefing at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said he had dispatched Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Panama, but did 
not elaborate. A White House official said the trip was intended to boost the 
morale of the troops and to illustrate that the President, while proceeding 
with his own holiday plans, was closely in touch with the military and 
political situation here. Officials did not say how long Cheney would remain in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. Concern 
</P>
<P>
American officials have been concerned about a political backlash in both the 
United States and Panama if it is determined the U.S. assault caused heavy 
civilian casualties. 
</P>
<P>
In a television interview, Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for 
Latin America, acknowledged the figure could be as high as 1,000 Panamanians 
killed or injured in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
He noted that an early report that a Panama City hospital was full of hundreds 
of dead civilians turned out to be false. But, he added, "I don't mean to 
minimize the problem. There are clearly going to be civilian casualties, but I 
don't think we should speculate (on figures) based on rumors." 
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Cheney acknowledged that the presence of a massive 
American occupation force in Panama was making it more difficult for President 
Endara to establish a credible democratic government. 
</P>
<P>
Endara said Saturday that news of the impending American invasion, which he 
received a day before American soldiers landed, was "like a kick in the head." 
He said he had made no prior plans for forming a government. 
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps Mr. Endara would say we are a mixed blessing," Cheney said. "We did 
what we did partly to stand up for democracy in Panama, but also to protect 
American interests and American lives in Panama. We have a legitimate right to 
be in Panama." 
</P>
<P>
Cheney said that some pro-Noriega paramilitary forces, called Dignity 
Battalions, were still "running loose in the streets, but the situation appears 
to be steadily improving." 
</P>
<P>
Explaining why the looting got out of hand after the invasion, Cheney said, "We 
didn't have any way to have people everywhere in Panama City at the same time. 
We sent in a large number of additional troops, but we had to focus in on 
specific targets." 
</P>
<P>
He said that many former members of the Panama Defense Forces were laying down 
their arms and that 1,000 of them had joined in efforts to restore civil order. 
"So, the situation does appear to be improving. It's not all over yet. I mean 
we still have a lot of work to do, but clearly we're in better shape today than 
at any point since the effort started." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Sunday that U.S. troops would remain 
in Panama "as long as it takes to get the job done." 
</P>
<P>
"We really ought not to put a date on it, because then we get into playing the 
old expectations game," Baker added. 
</P>
<P>
Aronson said that the chaos and looting that followed after the American 
military "neutralized" the PDF was regrettable, but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
"Three months ago Hurricane Hugo hit St. Croix, Virgin Islands, which is U.S. 
territory. You saw the exact same pictures; in Detroit, in 1968; in Washington 
D.C. Wherever there is a temporary breakdown of law and order there's going to 
be a small criminal element who will go in and break a window and steal a 
television set. We don't minimize the loss; we obviously regret it. And it's 
not a happy occasion." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
Manuel A. Noriega became commander of the Panama Defense Forces Aug. 12, 1983, 
12 days after receiving his star as a brigadier general. He had risen through 
the ranks after joining the old National Guard in 1962. As a lieutenant 
colonel, he had headed the intelligence unit under the late Gen. Omar Torrijos, 
a military dictator who negotiated the Panama Canal treaties with the United 
States in the 1970s. He became a colonel and chief of the general staff in 
1982. Noriega defied a military rule and tradition when he refused to retire in 
1987, after 25 years of service. He was deposed Dec. 20 by invading U.S. 
troops.

PANAMA UPDATE 
</P>
<P>
Noriega 
</P>
<P>
Ousted dictator Manuel A. Noriega turned himself in to the Vatican embassy in 
Panama City and asked for political asylum, U.S. officials announced. Earlier, 
four of Noriega's top commanders surrendered to U.S. soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
The Fighting 
</P>
<P>
Fighting tapered off, with some Panamanians trying to clean up streets and put 
up Christmas decorations. U.S. troops discovered a huge cache of arms in a 
rented house near Noriega's family home in an upper-middle class section of 
Panama City. Neighbors who tipped off the military said the house had been 
rented by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Local Government 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-backed President Guillermo Endara said that he hoped the Americans would 
be able to leave soon but that he wasn't optimistic. In Washington, President 
Bush said that American troops have accomplished "a real turnaround" in 
restoring law and order in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Casualties 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon said that U.S. casualties since Wednesday's invasion were 25 
American servicemen and two civilians killed, 281 servicemen wounded and one 
missing. U.S. figures on Panamanian casualties were 154 military dead and 113 
wounded, with 2,969 troops being held prisoner.

BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Some of Europe's worst urban warfare since World War II continued to rage in 
Bucharest and other Romanian cities on Sunday despite a warning by Romania's 
new provisional government that those opponents who fail to lay down their arms 
will be punished "promptly and mercilessly." 
</P>
<P>
The sights and sounds of anarchy -- sniper fire, roadblocks and flaming 
buildings -- dominated the capital as army units and their civilian allies 
fought on to dislodge forces still loyal to deposed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no government," said one Western diplomat. "Nobody seems to be in 
charge." 
</P>
<P>
Bucharest Radio insisted that army troops supporting the popular uprising which 
last Friday deposed Ceausescu were in control of all strategic points in the 
country, and that some fighters loyal to the old regime had begun to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
But other loyalists, though badly outnumbered, were still putting up a savage 
struggle that surprised even those who have long viewed them as an 
extraordinarily ruthless, well-trained and fanatic force. 
</P>
<P>
With the city's airport still closed and the scene of heavy fighting, the U.S., 
Canadian, Israeli and Japanese embassies evacuated more than a 150 dependents 
by car Sunday afternoon to the Bulgarian border. 
</P>
<P>
As if to underscore the need for that evacuation, more than 30 dependents of 
British officials were forced to abandon their embassy later in the day and 
seek refuge in the American compound after the British ambassador's residence, 
which overlooks some of the heaviest fighting, caught fire. The Britons had 
chosen not to join the earlier evacuation. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian army sources told Reuters news agency in Bucharest that there appeared 
to be about 3,000 Ceausescu loyalists providing the backbone of a bloody 
resistance that the Red Cross estimated had claimed up to 5,000 lives over the 
weekend alone. 
</P>
<P>
Even more were reported killed earlier in Timisoara, where Romania's popular 
uprising began 10 days ago. 
</P>
<P>
More than half the holdouts are believed to be in the Romanian capital, where, 
traveling in plain clothes through a secret network of subterranean passageways 
and with access to hidden stockpiles of arms and ammunition, they have wreaked 
havoc by firing from roofs and top-floor apartments on soldiers and civilians 
below. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were reported in army custody on Saturday, 
although no details of his alleged capture have yet been revealed, and the 
so-called Front of National Salvation has produced 
</P>
<P>
no evidence that he is actually in the new government's hands. 
</P>
<P>
Soviet state television reported without elaboration Sunday that the couple 
were apprehended while hiding in an underground bunker. At about the same time, 
Bucharest Radio said that soldiers have found a vast network of safehouses and 
secret tunnels criss-crossing the city. The tunnels were stocked with arms, 
ammunition and electronic monitoring equipment, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
The Ceausescus' son, Nicu, was arrested and shown on television Friday, and on 
Sunday it was revealed that their daughter, Zoia, was also being held at the 
state television studios which have become an important headquarters of the 
revolution. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the provisional government said Ceausescu has not been shown on 
television because of concern that his appearance might inspire the dreaded 
Securitate, the dictator's secret police and his own private guard, to step up 
their last-ditch struggle. 
</P>
<P>
In Switzerland, meanwhile, the justice minister said Sunday that the government 
has imposed a "precautionary" freeze on any assets the Ceausescus might have in 
that country. The authorities acted after Romanian exile groups said that the 
deposed dictator had stashed up to $400 million worth of gold in Zurich. 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television continued to be one of the diehard security forces' primary 
targets Sunday. Interviewed from a studio in the station in the afternoon, 
Independent Television News correspondent Paul Davies reported that the 
building had come under bazooka attack minutes before. 
</P>
<P>
"These attacks came all day yesterday, into the night, into the early morning. 
We had a lull for two or three hours, and now they're starting again," he said, 
adding: "It's one thing to have soldiers and tanks around the building; it's 
another to actually secure it." 
</P>
<P>
At one point early Sunday, Ceausescu supporters in civilian clothes reportedly 
penetrated the building, killing a woman and wounding two men in a knife and 
rifle attack before being subdued. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the afternoon, the sound of sniper fire from rooftops scattered 
crowds around the city. And residents nervously talked of reports that 
Securitate men attacked hospitals early Sunday, destroying blood supplies and 
seizing ambulances in which they reportedly cruised the city, shooting into 
crowds. 
</P>
<P>
In the city's central square, the Plaza of the Republic, tanks and armored 
personnel carriers stood guard and the sound of machine-gun fire echoed off the 
still-burning shells of wrecked buildings. 
</P>
<P>
In the main university library, which faces the square, a huge fire raged out 
of control for a second day. Across the square, young men in civilian clothes 
carrying knives and semi-automatic rifles guarded the former headquarters of 
the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party, now being used by the 
army and the civilian committees of the Front of National Salvation. 
</P>
<P>
Trucks, buses, cement mixers, trolleys and overturned tables and chairs were 
used to block traffic in the streets as residents searched for Securitate 
agents. Virtually every neighborhood in the city's central area had roadblocks 
protected by nervous-looking young men, some armed with automatic rifles, 
others with clubs, bats and pieces of wood. 
</P>
<P>
A drive at mid-afternoon to the city center from the southern edge of the city, 
a distance of only a few miles, required passage though nine separate 
roadblocks, some no more than two blocks apart. At each stop, the blockaders 
searched all cars, looking in trunks and under hoods, eyeing foreigners 
suspiciously and demanding to see passports. 
</P>
<P>
Pedestrians, even small children 
</P>
<P>
and elderly women, were routinely being patted down in the search for weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The provisional government set up by the army and the Front of National 
Salvation has appealed to the public to avoid further revenge attacks which, it 
said, had reached "alarming proportions." Where possible, army troops protected 
prisoners against angry mobs of Romanians. But by and large the plea seems to 
have been ignored in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
A Western diplomat reported seeing a Securitate agent beaten to death by a 
crowd that seized him at a roadblock. Another agent captured after being 
refused refuge at a Western embassy was beaten and taken away in a car by armed 
men. 
</P>
<P>
The greatest fury appears to be directed at agents of the elite anti-terrorist 
squads, known by their Romanian initials, USLA, who are blamed for the worst of 
the shooting here. 
</P>
<P>
The anger in the streets has been further inflamed by constantly repeated but 
never verified rumors that Ceausescu loyalists are being aided by foreign 
mercenaries, variously described as Asian or Arab -- Libyan, Palestinian or 
Syrian. These reports have made many Romanians suspicious of nearly all 
foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu reportedly had provided training grounds in the countryside for 
terrorist groups, and he had maintained close security links with North Korea 
and some hard-line Arab states. 
</P>
<P>
Reuters news agency quoted Lt. Col. Georges Ionesco as saying that six men 
killed in Saturday night fighting were believed to be Syrians, and a Reuters 
photographer visiting a Bucharest hospital quoted medical personnel as saying 
that some of the Securitate men they had treated were Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
A British Broadcasting Corp. radio correspondent with long experience in the 
region reported that he saw a wounded Securitate man in the hospital "who 
looked suspiciously Asian." 
</P>
<P>
The BBC man added, however, that while "I'm sure there are foreigners who have 
been fighting on behalf of Ceausescu . . . I suspect the number is greatly 
exaggerated by the popular imagination here." 
</P>
<P>
Securitate forces in Iasi, near the Soviet border, were reported to have 
surrendered en masse Sunday, triggering celebrations throughout the town. 
Foreign and 
</P>
<P>
Romanian television broadcasts monitored in the West also showed what were 
reputed to be uniformed, loyalist forces who switched sides during the day and 
are now supporting the army. And the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug said more than 
40 security troops, including a number of women, had surrendered in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately clear whether the new government's call for a cease-fire 
at mid-afternoon Sunday had played a role in the surrenders. Its warning 
appeared to apply both to pro-Ceausescu forces and armed vigilante bands 
seeking revenge against them. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone other than army troops who have weapons should turn them over by 5 p.m. 
today, according to the provisional government announcement. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one more drop of blood should be shed," it said, adding that anyone 
violating the cease-fire would be punished "promptly and mercilessly." 
</P>
<P>
Outside of Bucharest, the military situation was spotty. 
</P>
<P>
A BBC television crew encountered 46 checkpoints in the 250-mile drive from the 
Hungarian border to the capital, all of them apparently manned by 
anti-Ceausescu militias and the army. But a local army commander warned the 
crew against traveling certain routes. 
</P>
<P>
In Timisoara, four journalists and a diplomat were wounded by snipers or men 
manning roadblocks Saturday night and early Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
State radio also reported fighting in Sibiu and Brasov, two more towns that 
were considered strongholds of Ceausescu's secret police. 
</P>
<P>
In the border town of Giurgiu, residents told reporters that 15 people had been 
killed Saturday afternoon when Securitate members seized a church and a 
neighboring apartment building 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first convoys of outside medical aid began to reach the capital 
in the afternoon. Crowds cheered as the first such parade of trucks arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The convoy had started out from the Bulgarian border town of Ruse, carrying 21 
doctors and 15 nurses from French civil defense forces as well as others from 
the Paris-based humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders. The doctors brought 
with them several tons of hospital beds, blood supplies and vitally needed 
medical equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Other aid teams arrived later from the Red Cross. And the Czechoslovak news 
agency CTK said the first shipment of medicines from Czechoslovakia had reached 
Timisoara by road. 
</P>
<P>
Hungary also sent a convoy to the western Romanian border region. 
</P>
<P>
The 35-mile drive from the Bulgarian border to Bucharest took several hours as 
the convoy wound its way through farm villages, many of which were slated to be 
destroyed in the sweeping rural reconstruction program that Ceausescu had began 
imposing on the countryside several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
The towns looked mostly peaceful, in marked contrast with the capital. In one 
village, public buildings displayed the new version of the Romanian flag -- the 
traditional red, yellow and blue banner with a large hole in the center where 
the Communist insignia had been cut out. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, an official of the Soviet Health Ministry said 200 doctors and 
medics were standing by to help but that the ministry had been unable to assure 
their safe passage across the Soviet-Romanian border. 
</P>
<P>
The British Red Cross said it has been inundated with donations to a special 
Romanian appeal fund. "The response has been terrific," said Director General 
John Burke-Gaffney. But another official stressed that the needs in Romania are 
so great that more help is needed.

TOUR OF DUTY PLACES CHRISTMAS ON HOLD FOR MILITARY FAMILIES

<P>
For many families in this gritty military town next door to Ft. Ord, Christmas 
is on hold, awaiting the end of a conflict thousands of miles away. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not like a holiday. I don't feel in the mood," said Ramona Remy, the 
mother of a newborn and a 5-year-old son. 
</P>
<P>
Santa will come for Remy's children eventually. But she had to explain to her 
5-year-old that "Daddy is on a tour of duty" and would not be home on Christmas 
morning. Remy will leave her gifts and those of her husband's under the tree 
until his tour of duty ends. 
</P>
<P>
Three thousand miles away, in another military town, Fayetteville, N.C., a 
similar scene was played out in Mary Pugliese's home. She had to explain to her 
5-year-old son, Vincent Jr., why his father would be away for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Daddy is Army Capt. Vincent Pugliese, a company commander in the 313th Military 
Intelligence Battalion based at nearby Ft. Bragg. Pugliese's company was in the 
vanguard of U.S. military forces that invaded Panama last week. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest job now is making sure other families aren't alone during the 
holidays," Mary Pugliese said, as she looked forward to joining with the 
families of other enlisted men at the home of their husbands' first sergeant. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the United States, military wives whose husbands abruptly deployed 
for combat in Panama spent the holiday weekend trying to maintain their 
Christmas cheer while trying to hold down their anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
Some, Mary Pugliese among them, found solace in keeping busy -- making 
stockings for unmarried soldiers away from home, going shopping at the last 
minute, entertaining visiting relatives. Some canceled planned feasts and 
scaled back celebrations. Some said they planned to spend Christmas Day with 
other wives whose husbands also were sent to Central America with barely time 
to say goodby. 
</P>
<P>
It was a trying time, especially for young mothers who struggled to keep the 
day festive for their children. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a little boy who is 6 years old. He's counting on Mom," said Shandra 
Riffey, whose husband, a Ft. Ord soldier, was among those sent to fight in 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether we like it or not, the holiday season is here. The easiest thing to do 
is to stick together," said Kelli Borges, another Ft. Ord wife. This was to be 
her first Christmas with her husband of six months. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, we're just going to wait until he gets back," she said. After a pause, 
she added: "I just hope and pray to God that he comes back." 
</P>
<P>
Ft. Ord spokesmen do not say how many soldiers have gone to Panama, though the 
number is in the thousands. At least one infantryman from Ft. Ord has been 
killed and 13 have been reported wounded. 
</P>
<P>
Marina is a town where bumper stickers still denounce Jane Fonda for her 
opposition to the U.S. military's role in Vietnam. It is a place with its share 
of churches and bars. At one bar, Mortimer's, two televisions aired Sunday 
football games, but no one from the base was there to watch. 
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers left in town on Sunday watched a pool game in a bar across from 
Mortimer's, but they would not talk about Panama, so concerned were they that 
any information could be used against their buddies by forces loyal to deposed 
dictator Gen. Manuel A. Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Some wives would talk only if the names of their husbands were not used. 
</P>
<P>
Whatever happened to be the latest news of Panama was the talk of the town. 
Families grasped for any word out of Central America. When Ramona Remy heard 
that her husband had been quoted in a news service story in the local 
newspaper, she exclaimed, "Thank God, that means he's all right." 
</P>
<P>
Lisa Flowers, 26, the mother of two young children, felt a need to pray on 
Sunday and went to the First Baptist Church with a friend, Lisa Buckner, 31, a 
member of the congregation whose husband also is in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
The preacher, William Hoops, read the story of Jesus' birth from the Book of 
Luke. Then, he prayed for the men who are "out there defending our right to 
believe in Christ." 
</P>
<P>
After the service, Flowers, like the other wives, told of breaking into tears. 
Her 7-year-old son saw her cry and tried to reassure her, telling her: " 'He's 
going to do his job and come home.' " 
</P>
<P>
The children may not understand the dangers in Panama. But the people left 
behind do. "We have to talk about it. You can't keep it inside. Sometimes, you 
have to let it out and cry," Flowers said. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't matter if an old friend is calling with a holiday wish. When the 
telephone rings, or there is a knock at the front door, "your heart drops," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hope it's over soon," Flowers' friend, Buckner, said. "I just want my 
husband home." 
</P>
<P>
Near Ft. Bragg, Lisa Scott, 21, of suburban Hope Mills, N.C., was feeling the 
same emotions. She said that she and her husband of three years, Pfc. Michael 
Scott of Ft. Bragg's 82nd Airborne Division, had planned to start some special 
Christmas Eve traditions of their own this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This would have been our first Christmas together by ourselves as a family," 
she said. "The others since we were married we've spent either with his parents 
or with mine." 
</P>
<P>
Among other customs they had hoped to institute this year was one of sitting 
around the tree on Christmas Eve and reading the story of Christ's birth from 
the Bible to their two young children, Michael II, 2, and Amanda, 8 months. 
</P>
<P>
But, she hastened to add, their plans won't be scrapped -- just postponed. "I'm 
keeping the tree up and the presents wrapped until Mike gets back," she said. 
"We'll do everything we wanted to do. It'll just be two or three weeks later." 
</P>
<P>
At suburban Fayetteville's sprawling Cross Creek Mall, the region's largest 
shopping center, Cathy Sessoms took time off from work on Christmas Eve to 
scrawl a message in blue ink on one of the three 4-by-8-foot panels that the 
mall and a Durham television station designed as a giant Christmas card to be 
sent to the troops in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
"We will do Xmas when you get back. I love you," Sessoms, 26, wrote to her 
fiancee, Spec. Brian Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
Hers was among thousands of messages that filled the panels. Sessoms vowed that 
when Reynolds returns: "I'm just gonna grab him and hug him and kiss him. I 
miss him so much. We just got engaged about two weeks ago." 
</P>
<P>
Chris Rietveld spent much of Christmas Eve trying to arrange for her husband to 
spend Christmas Day at home on leave from the base hospital at Ft. Bragg. 
</P>
<P>
Her husband, Spec. David Rietveld of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, was 
among 37 wounded servicemen who were flown from Panama to Ft. Bragg late Friday 
night for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
Rietveld was among the most seriously injured, having been hit by grenade 
fragments that broke his arm in two places and left him with shrapnel wounds in 
his arm and leg. 
</P>
<P>
Dan Morain reported from Ft. Ord; David Treadwell reported from Ft. Bragg.

BUSH SENDS CHENEY TO VISIT U.S. TROOPS

President Bush, dispatching Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Panama on a 
morale-boosting visit with U.S. troops on Christmas Eve, said Sunday that 
members of the armed forces there "put their lives on the line for the basic 
values of liberty and decency on which our nation is founded." 
</P>
<P>
In a brief radio address, Bush portrayed the massive U.S. assault on the regime 
of Panamanian strongman Manuel A. Noriega as part of a long American tradition 
of confronting tyrants. 
</P>
<P>
"We are a people with the endurance to work day and night for peaceful 
solutions when we can. But we are also a people with the strength to confront 
tyranny when we must. Gen. Noriega is the latest one to learn that lesson," 
Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
The President, who was spending the Christmas holiday at Camp David with his 
family, flew by helicopter to the Pentagon to broadcast his message over Armed 
Forces Radio. He also received a 90-minute briefing on developments in Panama 
and spoke by telephone with Gen. Maxwell R. Thurman, the senior officer of the 
U.S. Southern Command in Panama. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, Bush said a "real turnaround" had been achieved in restoring public 
order and that U.S. troops were now turning their attention to "humanitarian 
concerns," including caring for thousands of civilian casualties and refugees. 
</P>
<P>
In his radio speech, the President said: "Our hearts and those of every 
American go out to the families of those who fell. To all those who mourn a 
husband, a son, a brother, a father or a friend, I can only offer the thanks of 
a grateful nation. Your loved ones served a noble and just cause with honor and 
distinction." 
</P>
<P>
Bush noted that it was exactly 45 years ago that he returned from service as a 
Navy flier in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
"History has long since passed judgment on those years of conflict. But that 
war did not end all wars, and today we still live in times of great challenge, 
and there are still times when America must sacrifice in the cause of peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Years from now, let it be said that America used her strength for good, and 
let it be known that she honored her defenders of freedom," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Cheney mission was kept secret until after his Air Force plane was in the 
air.

THOUSANDS HAVE SOUGHT REFUGE IN EMBASSIES

In taking refuge in the offices of the papal nuncio in Panama City, Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega has borrowed a popular technique from the dissidents of the world, 
thousands of whom have sought protection and escape through foreign embassies 
throughout the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
Under international law, foreign embassies and the ground on which they sit are 
considered the territory of the country to which they belong. Forces from 
outside countries cannot legally enter embassies to retrieve people who have 
been provided safe haven. The papal nuncio, as the Vatican's diplomatic 
representative, enjoys such status. 
</P>
<P>
The vast majority of cases in which individuals have sought refuge inside 
foreign embassies are quite different from Noriega's, however, at least as the 
United States views the deposed Panamanian dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Most of those seeking diplomatic asylum in recent years have been dissidents 
and others fleeing from brutal regimes or hard-line Communist countries. 
</P>
<P>
Last June, Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing 
after the massacre of hundreds of protesters demanding democratic reforms. 
Lizhi remains inside the embassy, under threat of arrest by Chinese authorities 
if he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty lived for 15 years at the U.S. Embassy in 
Budapest, until the mid-1960s. Hungarian authorities had arrested him and 
sentenced him to life in prison for being an enemy of communism in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
In a harrowing escape from Iran in 1979, a handful of Americans got away by 
hiding at the Canadian Embassy in Iran. They were quickly smuggled from the 
country by Canadian diplomats. Fifty-two who were less fortunate spent 444 days 
as hostages and gained worldwide attention. 
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1983, seven Pentecostalists lived for five years in a single room 
at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow after fleeing from Soviet religious persecution. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from these small groups and individuals, huge numbers of people have at 
times sought refuge by crowding the grounds of foreign embassies in their 
homelands. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, 10,000 Cubans descended upon the Peruvian Embassy seeking to emigrate. 
Most eventually received exit visas and arrived in the United States in what 
became known as the Mariel boatlift.

L.A. ROMANIANS VOICE SUPPORT AT VIGIL 
</P>

About 300 Romanian protesters held a candlelight vigil Sunday night outside Los 
Angeles City Hall, calling for military and economic support to revolutionary 
troops fighting the security forces of ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"We need support now, not a week later," said Ionela Opran, a spokeswoman for 
the Romanian Faith and Freedom Coalition, which organized the protest. 
</P>
<P>
Opran said the coalition was also calling for the Romanian Embassy in 
Washington to make public the files kept by Ceausescu's security agents on 
Romanian dissidents in the United States. About 40,000 Romanians live in 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators sang "Rise up Romanian," a popular protest song, and the 
Romanian national anthem. Others raised clenched fists and chanted slogans in 
support of the Romanian army, which has played an important role in the 
overthrow of Ceausescu and continues to battle members of a secret police force 
loyal to the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Nicolae Suciu, 22, was one of several Romanian exiles at the demonstration who 
said they were prepared to travel to their homeland to fight as volunteers for 
the provisional revolutionary government. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a married man with two children," he said. "But I'm ready to go fight with 
my friends, my brothers, my cousins, who are standing up to the killers in 
Ceausescu's secret police." 
</P>
<P>
Suciu called on the United States to provide military support to the 
revolutionaries in Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"We need someone to give us armaments, munitions, guns. We need M-1 rifles, 
bazookas, everything," said Suciu, who wore a sash made of red, blue and yellow 
ribbons, the colors of the Romanian flag. 
</P>
<P>
Suciu said he had spoken by telephone with eyewitnesses to the fighting in the 
provincial cities of Medias and Sibiu. But most of the protesters said they 
have had little or no contact with their relatives in Romania since the 
fighting began last week in the provincial town of Timisoara.

Bruno Nastasescu, 55, said the only information he had about the events in his 
native country was from television news reports, which showed scenes of 
fighting in Bucharest and the unearthing of mass graves in Timisoara. 
</P>
<P>
"I am watching the television and I am crying all the time," he said.

BETHLEHEM, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deserted streets and shuttered shops have become as emblematic of Christmas in 
Bethlehem as creches and holly, but for the Palestinian Christian community, 
the lack of cheer extends beyond the surface sobriety of a holiday in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
As the Palestinian uprising against Israel wears on, the flight of Christians 
from the occupied land is leading members of the dwindling minority to ponder 
with alarm the possible extinction of traditional and revered communities. 
</P>
<P>
Whole families are packing up to search for surer political and economic 
surroundings in foreign lands. The best young minds are leaving to seek 
education abroad because universities in the occupied West Bank, where 30,000 
Christians live, have been closed by Israeli authorities for more than two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
The exodus raises visions of a vacant Christian landscape in places such as 
Jerusalem, whose Arab neighborhoods were fully annexed by Israel in 1967, and 
in and around Bethlehem, on the West Bank. Churches and shrines become mere 
museums of a dead past, peopled only by priests, monks and nuns without a flock 
to watch over. 
</P>
<P>
"The question is: Do we want a church of stone blocks or a church of people?" 
asked Geries Khoury, a Palestinian theologian and director of the Al Liqa 
Center, a religious institute on the outskirts of Bethlehem. "I think that if 
such a situation persists, only stones will mark the holy sites of 
Christianity." 
</P>
<P>
"There has long been emigration, but it could be a danger if it goes on in this 
rhythm," said Michel Sabah, the Roman Catholic bishop of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
It is hard to obtain precise data on the exodus of Christians from among the 
1.7 million population of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. About 3,000 Christian 
Arabs live in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
Some churches keep tabs on their members, others do not. There were 27,000 
Christians in Jerusalem in 1948; today, there are 12,000. Bethlehem, with a 
population of 30,000, was once 80% Christian; now Christians make up less than 
half of the population. 
</P>
<P>
About 80,000 Christians live in Israel and are Israeli citizens and thus have 
political rights denied Palestinians in the occupied land. Most Arab Christians 
belong to ancient churches, including the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic, Roman 
Catholic and Syrian Catholic churches. 
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinian Christians argue that their only chance to secure a vital 
community is through the Arab revolt and its promise of an independent state. 
But even that hope is clouded. Strains of Islamic fundamentalism that are 
intolerant of Christian customs have become prominent and are frightening the 
already beleaguered minority. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the Christians tend to throw in their lot with the intifada, as the 
uprising is called. 
</P>
<P>
"We prefer the Palestinian state with its risks and advantages. And as 
Christians, we would prefer a liberal Palestinian state," commented Peter 
Madros, a Roman Catholic priest in Beit Sahur, believed to be the site of the 
field where angels announced the birth of Christ to shepherds. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian experts point out that a decline in the Christian population in the 
Holy Land has gone on steadily since the end of the 19th Century, when the 
region was under Ottoman Turk rule. Hardship and hunger brought on by land 
confiscations forced many Palestinians to seek a new life abroad, notably in 
Latin America and Australia. In Honduras, the descendants of Palestinian 
immigrants are called Turcos because their forebears originally came carrying 
Turkish passports. 
</P>
<P>
The success of Palestinians in setting up themselves abroad was a magnet for 
those who stayed behind. Sometimes success was measured modestly. While doing 
research into the Palestinian diaspora, theologian Khoury came across a letter 
from his grandfather, who wrote about the abundance of bread in Argentina as an 
enticement for others to come. 
</P>
<P>
Israel's 1948 war of independence drove hundreds of thousands of Palestinians 
into exile, including tens of thousands of Christians. Some Christians became 
active in the Palestine Liberation Organization, among them George Habash, who 
heads the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a Marxist PLO faction. 
</P>
<P>
The 1967 Six-Day War, which resulted in Israel's occupation of the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, created a new sense of despair among Palestinian Christians. 
Land confiscations and Israeli settlements ate away at farming and business. 
Military rule meant a tangle of rules designed to keep the Palestinians under 
control. Travel, construction and business permits were bound up in a 
bureaucratic tangle. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Palestinians thought that 1967 was the end," Khoury said. 
</P>
<P>
The intifada, while instilling a degree of nationalist pride, brought further 
practical hardships. Because the community values education, the closing of 
schools by the 
</P>
<P>
Israeli authorities has hit hard. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a real brain drain among the Palestinian Christians," said James 
Fleming, who heads the Biblical Resources Study Center near Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
The economies of towns such as Bethlehem, Beit Jala, Beit Sahur and Ramallah, 
which have important Christian enclaves, have suffered a sharp decline. Tourist 
traffic is off by 80%; hotels and shops that sell traditional olive-wood manger 
scenes are empty. Commerce from Israeli day visitors, who used to buy groceries 
and frequent Arab restaurants, has all but ended. 
</P>
<P>
The frequent commercial strikes called by the leadership of the uprising has 
cut into sales to the Palestinian public. 
</P>
<P>
Beit Sahur made news in the fall when its residents resisted efforts by the 
military government to collect taxes. In doing so, however, scores of families 
lost their possessions. 
</P>
<P>
"We are hanging on by very little," said Yaacov, a carpenter in Bethlehem who 
asked that only his first name be used. "We want to live here. It is our home. 
But the young people have no future." 
</P>
<P>
Yaacov has sent one college-age son to Germany to study and hopes to send 
another one. However, because he refused to pay taxes, he fears that the 
military government will not give his second son clearance to travel abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Khaled, a partner in a video cassette rental store in Ramallah who declined to 
give his family name, said he plans to leave for Australia early next year to 
join a brother who emigrated a decade ago. He has sold his furniture, car and 
share in a family olive grove. 
</P>
<P>
"We Palestinians have always had to look for a better life elsewhere," said 
Khaled, a father of four. "I'm not sure that even a state would make things 
easy for us. Tiny groups do not do well in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
Hints of the vulnerability of the Christians in the vast Islamic community 
surfaced in instances of harassment by Muslim fundamentalist groups. Women have 
been told to cover their heads and arms in the Muslim fashion, and some liquor 
vendors were ordered to close down. 
</P>
<P>
"Christians wonder what they are going to do here if Islamic forces continue to 
gain power," Khoury said. 
</P>
<P>
Christian leaders say that for political and theological reasons, it is 
important for Christians to keep a toehold in not just historic Palestine but 
the Middle East as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
Some believe that Christians can serve as a link between the Western and Arab 
worlds because of their ties to both. 
</P>
<P>
"Christians have many cultural ties to the Arab world and Islam. It is good for 
us to be here to be a bridge," said Khoury, whose Al Liqa Center hosts frequent 
Muslim-Christian dialogues. 
</P>
<P>
Theologically, the presence of Christians fits with the faith's ideal of 
"bearing witness." 
</P>
<P>
"It would be ironic for a living Christian community to disappear from the land 
of His (Christ's) ministry," said Naem Ateek, a Palestinian theologian in 
Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
Many Palestinians resent the activities of fundamentalist Christian sects from 
the West that ignore the plight of the Palestinians and unswervingly support 
Israel's policies. The support of the fundamentalists is based on beliefs that 
the creation of the Jewish state fulfills biblical prophecy. 
</P>
<P>
Some Palestinian theologians have responded to the intifada by trying to 
advocate Christian-based nonviolence and to teach a brand of "liberation 
theology" in some ways similar to the teachings popular in churches in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
However, they ran into an immediate roadblock in the Old Testament passages 
that tell of the Jewish flight from Egypt and conquest of the land of Canaan. 
In Latin America, theologians base their "liberation theology" on the Exodus 
story and its account of the struggle against oppression. But the Palestinians 
do not find the account liberating: The stories are frequently used by Jewish 
fundamentalists and right-wing Israeli politicians to justify an exclusive 
claim to the land. 
</P>
<P>
The counter-theory in vogue among Palestinian theologians is one that depicts a 
universal God of justice rather than a tribal and exclusive God. Such a theory 
accepts the existence of a Jewish state, but with the Palestinian state 
recognized as an equal right for Arabs, exponents say.

ISRAELIS MAY BOOST DEFENSE SPENDING

Finance Minister Shimon Peres asked Israel's Cabinet on Sunday to approve a 
$27.2-billion state budget for 1990 that would put more money into battling the 
Palestinian uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The Cabinet met for seven hours and will discuss the draft budget again today 
before voting on the proposal and sending it to Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry proposed defense spending of $5.3 billion, an increase of 
$75 million over the current budget and nearly 20% of all spending for the 
fiscal year starting April 1, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The army had sought an extra $200 million, saying this was needed to meet the 
costs of fighting the 2-year-old revolt against Israeli rule of the occupied 
West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed budget also includes a $250-million provision for settling 40,000 
Jews expected to arrive in Israel next year, mostly from the Soviet Union. 
Value-added tax will be raised to 16% from 15% to finance the new expenditure, 
the Finance Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
The planned budget deficit will be $1.25 billion, regarded by many experts as 
inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
Peres, leader of the Labor Party, engineered a cost-cutting budget last year, 
but failed to deliver on a promise to reduce inflation, now running at an 
annual rate of 20%. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, he vowed that in 1990 he will bring the inflation rate down to less 
than 10%.

TUTU HOLDS IMPROMPTU AND DEFIANT CHRISTMAS RALLY ON THE WEST BANK;

BEIT SAHUR, Israeli-Occupied West Bank 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Normally, this kind of show of defiance would be dangerous: A child held aloft 
a poster bearing a pair of red, white, green and black pennants, the colors of 
the outlawed Palestinian flag. Ralliers danced around him singing nationalist 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers armed with M-16 rifles stood only a few feet away. The stage 
seemed set for yet another clash of stones and bullets. 
</P>
<P>
But a military commander approached, stared at the sign and the revelers, then 
silently walked back to a cordon of his troops. No tear gas, no arrests, no 
shooting, although security agents busily snapped photos of the revelers. 
</P>
<P>
Such was Christmas Eve in Beit Sahur, a West Bank town known for angels, 
shepherds and peaceful resistance to Israeli rule. The impromptu rally was held 
as residents of Beit Sahur gathered to hear Bishop Desmond M. Tutu, the Nobel 
Peace Prize winner from South Africa, speak during a sunset service near the 
fields where tradition holds that shepherds heard tidings of Jesus' birth. 
</P>
<P>
The event was billed as a traditional Christmas service, but the substance was 
notably political and the tone, defiant. And in its festive mood, the service 
stood in sharp contrast to somber celebrations next door in Bethlehem and to 
continuing violence, including the fatal shootings of five Palestinians by 
Israeli soldiers, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The visiting Anglican bishop spoke directly to the issue of the Palestinian 
conflict with Israel and his support for an independent Palestinian state. 
</P>
<P>
"We support the struggle of the Palestinian people for nationhood," he told a 
crowd of 3,000 that included mostly Christians, a smattering of Muslims and a 
handful of Jews from Israel. "Dear brothers, we also say that the Jews have a 
right to their independent state as well." 
</P>
<P>
Both comments drew applause. The "two-state solution" is now the Palestinians' 
guide to resolving their conflict with Israel. Israel rejects Palestinian 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu's visit was filled with the kind of images perhaps only possible in the 
Holy Land in conflict. He was escorted into the grounds of the YMCA in Beit 
Sahur by both Israeli soldiers and young activists of the Arab uprising. Each 
group claimed to be protecting him. 
</P>
<P>
Tutu and many of the worshipers approached the site waving an olive branch, a 
peace symbol born in this land. Beneath a canopy of pine and fig trees, Tutu 
listed harsh conditions that appeared to match Palestinian life under 
occupation. But at intervals, to the amusement of the crowd, he added the 
refrain, "Of course, I am talking about South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
"The boycott of schools, the tear gas, being shot at, being jailed, leaving 
into exile," he said at one point, pausing. "I am talking about South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials have bristled at suggestions that they treat the Palestinians 
the way the authorities in South Africa treat blacks under apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no peace anywhere in the world without justice," Tutu added. "We 
pray that Arab and Jew will find each other." 
</P>
<P>
The service broke up peacefully. No one could remember when a political rally 
by Palestinians had not been broken up by force. Beit Sahur gained notoriety 
this fall by resisting Israeli efforts to collect taxes. Despite the 
confiscation of property from dozens of homes and workshops and the arrest of 
several householders, the 12,000 residents refused to voluntarily pay back 
taxes. It was the most significant effort at passive resistance during the 
2-year-old intifada, or Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
The gloomy mood in Bethlehem was deepened by a weekend of violence in the city 
and elsewhere in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. News of the death of a 
15-year-old boy from Bethlehem set off a brief disturbance on Friday. The boy 
was shot last August by an Israeli settler, witnesses said, and had been kept 
on a respirator ever since. 
</P>
<P>
After stones rained on soldiers patrolling Bethlehem, they retaliated by firing 
tear gas and closing shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, there is no peace in Bethlehem," said Elias Freij, the longtime 
mayor of the city. "This year, the situation is worse. We are suffering more 
casualties, the tax collection is difficult and arbitrary, the jails are full 
of innocent people." 
</P>
<P>
Five other Palestinians were shot to death by soldiers over the weekend. More 
than 600 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops since the uprising 
began in 1987. More than 150 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs on 
suspicion of collaborating with Israel or for alleged crimes of vice. About 40 
Israelis have died at the hands of Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional procession by the Roman Catholic bishop of Jerusalem into 
Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity took place Sunday with muted pageantry. A 
file of Franciscan monks accompanied Msgr. Michel Sabah into the church, but 
the customary parade of Boy Scouts was absent, and there were no decorations in 
the square. All the shops of the city were closed in compliance with a strike 
call by the underground leadership of the uprising.

JAPAN'S DEFENSE BUDGET WILL SLIP BELOW 1% OF GROSS NATIONAL PRODUCT NEXT YEAR

<P>
Japan's defense budget is set to slip next year below the key level of 1% of 
gross national product, though actual military spending will rise, Finance 
Ministry officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Strong growth of the Japanese economy means a proposed 5.5% increase in 1990-91 
defense spending, to $29 billion, will still put it beneath 1% of GNP for the 
first time in four years. 
</P>
<P>
But the drop back below the controversial defense spending ceiling scrapped by 
former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone in 1987 has less to do with thawing 
East-West tensions than with the booming Japanese economy. 
</P>
<P>
"At this stage, we remain very prudent and cautious (about East-West 
relations)," one official told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
Nakasone's decision to scrap the 11-year-old ceiling in 1987, aiming to 
increase Japanese self-reliance in defense, was criticized by some of its 
neighbors in Asia who were worried about a possible resurgence of Japanese 
militarism. 
</P>
<P>
Tokyo's defense budget is the third biggest in the world, after the United 
States and the Soviet Union, but that is partly because of high personnel 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
The draft budget proposed by the Finance Ministry for the fiscal year beginning 
in April calls for the 5.5% increase in defense spending, after a 5.9% rise 
this year. The Defense Agency has asked for a 6.35% increase. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said they rejected many Defense Agency requests for 
new equipment, including 30 new tanks and a $940-million destroyer with a 
sophisticated Aegis weapons system. Instead, the proposed budget put more 
emphasis on improved logistics and support services. 
</P>
<P>
"The Finance Ministry agreed to the minimum budget needed to support an 
efficient and balanced self-defense force in the final year of the midterm 
plan," one ministry official said. 
</P>
<P>
Finance Ministry officials said that spending to help the United States offset 
the cost of troops stationed in Japan would rise more than 40% next fiscal 
year, to $320 million. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped with a big budget deficit, Washington has been pressing Tokyo to pick 
up a bigger share of the tab.

AMERICAN ALBUM: THE FUR IS FLYING IN TREND-SETTING ASPEN OVER A MEASURE TO BAN 
THE SALE OF ANIMAL SKINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

ASPEN, Colo. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It's Christmas, and the fur is flying here in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
For years, glitzy, ritzy Aspen, the star-studded town of the $100 tip, where 
the average home sells for $1 million and where celebrities from Prince and Don 
Johnson to Barbara Walters and Jack Nicholson live and play, has been a swell 
place to wear a fur coat. The temperatures plunge below freezing and expensive 
clothes are more the rule than the exception. 
</P>
<P>
Now it is also the town where the animal rights movement is making one of its 
more dramatic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
In seven weeks, residents will cast their ballots on an initiative to ban the 
sale of skins from anything but domestic animals such as cattle and sheep. If 
it is approved, Aspen would be the first city in the nation, and possibly the 
world, to institute such a ban. 
</P>
<P>
In some ways it seems like a pointless battle. There are only a handful of fur 
shops in town, and many of the furs literally fly in on the backs of tourists 
or second-home residents. 
</P>
<P>
But since little Aspen (population 6,000) in 1986 was the first city in the 
nation to ban smoking in restaurants -- a trend that mushroomed across the 
nation -- both sides are pouring resources into the fights. 
</P>
<P>
"The implications are pretty severe if this effort succeeds," said Jack Neal, 
spokesman for the Fur Information Council of America. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a pilot shot at the whole business," said Cleveland Amory, president 
and founder of the Animal Rights Fund, the nation's largest and oldest animal 
rights group. "For Aspen to do this is a landmark that might go to a lot of 
other places." 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of letters, pro and con, have flooded the town's two small daily 
newspapers from across the nation. Ads appear on television and in the 
newspapers. There are campaign mailings and buttons. Those opposed to the ban 
have even made it part of a campaign to recall the mayor and two city 
councilmen who support the ban. 
</P>
<P>
On one side is the Aspen Society for Animal Rights, a coalition of citizens 
supported by the People for Ethical Treatment of Animals in Washington, D.C., 
and the Animal Rights Fund in New York City, as well as animal rights groups in 
Europe and Australia. They argue that the fur garments are a frivolous, 
greed-driven fashion fueled by the inhumane treatment of animals. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are the furriers, ranchers and folks who just like to wear 
fur, represented locally by the Aspen Concerned Citizens Coalition and backed 
financially by the Fur Information Council of America, a New York City-based 
trade association. They argue that today's fur industry is a humane, highly 
regulated business in which 75% of the animals are ranched instead of trapped 
wild. 
</P>
<P>
The issue first surfaced three years ago when Georgie Leighton, an eccentric 
French resident, led a successful crusade to ban the sale of fur from animals 
caught in tortuous leg-hold traps. Katherine Thalberg, local bookstore owner, 
longtime activist and daughter of famed 1920s and 1930s movie producer Irving 
G. Thalberg, has taken up the mantle. 
</P>
<P>
Last spring, she and other activists began handing out anti-fur literature and 
holding rallies featuring prominent animal rights activists such as Amory and 
cartoonists Berke Breathed and William de Bok of Australia. Members would 
occasionally wear bloody furs in the town's pedestrian mall. 
</P>
<P>
Thalberg's most important recruit, however, has been her husband, Bill 
Stirling, who also happens to be the town's mayor. Stirling persuaded two of 
his four fellow council members to have the issue placed on the ballot for a 
Feb. 13 election.

<P>
The local pro-fur lobby retaliated by sending packages to members outlining 
form letters to be addressed to the mayor. The Fur Information Council of 
America, at their request, shipped in $3,000 for campaign ads and offered 
organizational support. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Kirkland, president of the pro-fur lobby and manager of Revillion, an 
exclusive fur store, has led the battle against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
"The mayor's trying to legislate his morality," said Kirkland, who contended 
that "freedom of choice" would be "legislated away" if the measure passed. 
</P>
<P>
Kirkland and others argue that while a ban obviously would be bad for local 
businesses that sell furs and fur-related products, it also would turn off 
those elite tourists who pour millions of dollars into the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have created the most expensive ski resort in the world, and people who 
patronize it are the people who wear fur," he said. "The fur wearer comes in 
and leaves a $100 tip. What we're saying to them (with this ordinance) is we 
don't want you if you wear fur, and that is a very anti-Aspen attitude." 
</P>
<P>
A summer poll of attitudes toward the ban showed those in favor trailing by 36% 
to 47%. However, there is an underlying tension in the city toward affluent 
tourists that could make the vote closer than expected. 
</P>
<P>
Longtime Aspen residents complain the vacationing elite have turned their 
once-unique mix of rich and ordinary residents into a gauche, yearly display of 
conspicuous consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"It stands to reason that an issue that generates such rabid allegiance must 
have to do with more than how you feel about muskrats," quipped Councilman 
Michael Glassman, an architect who opposes the ban.

anything but domestic animals such as cattle and sheep. In seven weeks, 
residents will cast their ballots. And as American Album points out, if the

possibly the world, to institute such a ban. So both sides of the animal rights

Pity the poor oyster farmers of the Bassin de Thau. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas was coming. All over France, people were preparing for their annual 
holiday feasts that traditionally include huge platters of the shellfish as a 
first course. 
</P>
<P>
The 8,000 French oyster farmers sell nearly half of their annual production in 
the Christmas-New Year's season. According to lore, if a Frenchman eats oysters 
at no other time during the year, he will have them for the midnight Christmas 
supper. 
</P>
<P>
What a blow then for the 300 oyster farmers in the Bassin de Thau, an estuary 
in the Mediterranean Sea southwest of Montpellier, when a government laboratory 
discovered traces of salmonella bacteria in oyster beds during a routine test 
at the end of November. 
</P>
<P>
For the Thau ostreiculteurs, it promised to be the bleakest Christmas ever with 
the French government cast as "le grinch who stole Noel." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, French President Francois Mitterrand came to their rescue this week, 
saying he was "touched by the drama of the oyster farmers in which a whole 
year's labor has been ruined." 
</P>
<P>
Mitterrand, an inveterate oyster-eater himself, instructed the government of 
Prime Minister Michel Rocard to speed up compensation payments to the oyster 
farmers so they will have relief before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Salmonella poisoning is a common problem with shellfish taken from polluted 
waters. Eating the contaminated food can result in acute gastroenteritis and 
even death among the young or elderly. 
</P>
<P>
Health specialists theorized that a severe drought this past fall in the 
Languedoc plateau above Montpellier caused animal waste to build up in the 
fields. Heavy rains at the end of November washed it to the sea, polluting the 
shallow Thau estuary. 
</P>
<P>
Acting quickly, the Ministry of Marine Affairs in Paris ordered the Thau 
oysters, which account for nearly 10% of the annual national crop of 120,000 
tons, taken off the market. 
</P>
<P>
Enraged by the government ruling, which they claimed contradicted reports from 
other laboratories showing their waters to be clean, the Thau oyster farmers 
went on the warpath. Gangs of them attacked the government laboratory at Sete, 
at the mouth of the Thau estuary, where the salmonella had been discovered. 
Using clubs and oyster trays, they broke windows and smashed computer screens. 
</P>
<P>
The rampaging oyster farmers and their families then blockaded the highway 
leading into the coastal town of Meze. Behind the barricades were 2,400 tables 
heaped with more than 5,000 tons of oysters ruled uneatable by the French 
government. 
</P>
<P>
"It is these kinds of ministerial edicts," fumed Rene Couveinhes, a Gaullist 
opposition member of Parliament from the Herault region that includes the Thau 
estuary, "that during The Terror of the French Revolution sent people to the 
scaffolds." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the generally held view that the Thau oysters are not among the first 
rank of French mollusks -- that honor is reserved for the famous fines de 
claires from Marenne and Oleron on the Atlantic coast -- the plight of the Thau 
oyster farmers won the sympathy of many in France. 
</P>
<P>
Food crises are taken very seriously here. People remember with horror the 
Vacherin cheese scare two years ago. Vacherin, a runny unpasteurized cheese 
from Switzerland and the French Jura region, is also a special Christmastime 
treat. In 1987-88, the Swiss brand Vacherin Mont d'Or was found to contain 
listeria, a potentially fatal bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
In 1985, it was the American horse-meat scandal that had people talking after 
trichinosis-causing worms were discovered in meat imported from Connecticut. 
There are also dozens of recurring wine and spirits flaps usually involving 
someone mixing a common table wine with some pedigreed appelation controle such 
as Bordeaux or Champagne. 
</P>
<P>
Oyster farming in France dates from the late 18th Century when the Baron 
Bellevert built an oyster park on the Normandy coast at Etretat. The oysters 
were delivered to Queen Marie Antoinette at Versailles in carriages pulled by a 
dozen horses. 
</P>
<P>
Oyster raising became a major food industry under Napoleon III in the next 
century. Today, France ranks fourth behind the United States, Japan and South 
Korea in oyster production. In 1988, the French consumed more than 76 million 
dozen oysters, or about 18 oysters for every man, woman and child in the 
country. About half of these are eaten during the Christmas season. 
</P>
<P>
To the French, oysters are as much a part of Christmas as an evergreen tree and 
the chocolate buche de Noel, or Yule Log. The slimy bivalves are extolled in 
French poetry and literature. The novelist Honore Balzac described himself as a 
"fat man with an incredible passion for oysters." 
</P>
<P>
Author Guy de Maupassant praised oysters as "sweet and fat, resembling little 
ears locked inside shells, melting in the mouth between the palate and the 
tongue like salted candy." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, oyster farmers are held in high regard in France in spite of their 
penchant for violence, as exhibited in the recent Thau oyster riots. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an unusual profession," commented Antoine Minaud, director of a 
government maritime office that was also attacked by the oyster farmers. "The 
shellfish farmers are restless people, difficult and traditionally very 
individualistic. Perhaps it is because they are half-sailor and half-farmer." 
</P>
<P>
With the plight of the Thau oyster farmers on the front pages alongside the 
massacres in Romania and the American invasion of Panama, it wasn't long before 
the politicians began to react. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Couveinhes, the Gaullist legislator from Herault, was making 
trouble for the Socialist government by defiantly eating the Thau oysters 
despite the ban. "I eat oysters and mussels from Thau waters every day," he 
said, "and I'm in good health." 
</P>
<P>
Finally, on Wednesday, during a meeting of the French council of ministers, 
President Mitterrand expressed his heart-felt concern for the Thau oyster 
farmers. He urged that compensation and other benefits, including government 
subsidized interest payments on agricultural loans, be given immediately, 
"before Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Initially, leaders in the French oyster industry feared the Thau oyster scare 
would severely hurt the key holiday market. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, restaurants in the immediate Mediterranean coastal area have been badly 
hurt. 
</P>
<P>
"This is breaking the local economy," said Pascal Jacquinot, chef of the 
respected Cote Bleue restaurant in Meze. "Our menu is mainly known for its 
shellfish. In this season we normally have 120 customers a day. We have 30 
employees and 12 cooks. But today we had only seven customers and no one for 
dinner." 
</P>
<P>
But as the Christmas feast, known as le Reveillon, draws near, most people in 
France are apparently discarding their fears and ordering their holiday 
oysters. 
</P>
<P>
"We had a slight decline of about 15% because of all the publicity over the 
Thau oysters," said Pascal Mousset, director of La Coupole, one of Paris's more 
famous oyster restaurants. "But as the holidays approach, people have begun to 
forget."

SOVIET DEPUTIES DENOUNCE '79 AFGHANISTAN INVASION 
</P>

<P>
Soviet lawmakers, in a remarkable admission of past Kremlin wrongdoing, stood 
for a moment's silence Sunday in memory of the thousands of soldiers killed in 
Afghanistan and then voted to denounce the country's 1979 invasion of its 
neighbor and the leaders who decided to launch the war. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved on the final day of the second session of the Congress 
of People's Deputies, was a reminder again of how eagerly the 2,250-member body 
has sought to air popular complaints and to take on the role, along with its 
legislative partner, the smaller Supreme Soviet, of a critic of Soviet society. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress also voted to condemn Red Army troops for their use of deadly 
force in putting down a nationalist demonstration in Tbilisi, Georgia, in April 
of this year and to continue investigating circumstances surrounding the clash. 
Twenty people were killed by the troops using shovels, clubs and gas. 
</P>
<P>
But before the vote was taken, about 200 deputies led by the Georgian 
delegation stormed out of the Kremlin's Palace of Congresses hall in anger over 
a speech by chief military prosecutor Alexander Katusev, who defended the 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself, surrounded by security men, strode into 
the lobby to persuade the deputies to return to their seats and to assure them 
that the Congress and nation as a whole mourns for those killed in Tbilisi. 
</P>
<P>
The resolution on the Afghan war was the strongest official statement yet 
against the December, 1979, invasion. Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, 
in a foreign policy address in October, acknowledged that the nine-year war was 
a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, by a vote of 1,678 to 18 with 19 abstentions, said the incursion 
deserved "moral and political condemnation" and castigated former Soviet 
leaders Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri V. Andropov, President Andrei Gromyko and 
Defense Minister Dmitri Ustinov -- now all dead -- for making the decision to 
invade. 
</P>
<P>
Andropov was head of the KGB secret police and Gromyko was foreign minister at 
the time of the Afghan invasion. 
</P>
<P>
The decision to invade "was made by a narrow circle of people in violation of 
the Soviet constitution, according to which such matters belong to the 
jurisdiction of higher state bodies," Alexander Dzasokhov, chairman of the 
committee on international affairs, told Congress in proposing the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Dzasokhov noted that the Soviet leaders had acted in an atmosphere of 
"excessively ideological and sharp political confrontation that characterized 
the international situation at the time." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he said, that "cannot justify the decision to dispatch troops." 
</P>
<P>
Dzasokhov stressed that Soviet veterans should not be condemned. "This 
political assessment does not cast a shadow on Soviet soldiers and officers who 
honestly did their duty," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before the vote in the Congress, Gorbachev and the deputies stood for a 
moment of silence. 
</P>
<P>
The government released new fatality figures, saying 14,143 soldiers were 
killed in the conflict. The previous official death toll was 13,310. 
</P>
<P>
During the debate on the violence in Georgia, conservative Politburo member 
Yegor K. Ligachev was named as bearing some responsibility for the deaths. 
</P>
<P>
Ligachev led a meeting of top party leaders two days before the clash, and 
during the session, troop commanders and Interior and Defense Ministry 
officials were informed of "the need to provide force and means in case of 
dangerous and life-threatening events" in Tbilisi, according to the 
investigatory commission. 
</P>
<P>
But Ligachev, in a letter to the commission, said he went on vacation the next 
day and learned about the fatal clash between troops and protesters only from a 
television report. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, commission chairman Anatoly Sobchak told the Congress: "If some 
leader makes a decision, I'd like to say he bears responsibility for that 
decision whether he finds out about its results on television or in his 
office." 
</P>
<P>
In a final statement before adjourning Sunday, the Congress called on the 
Soviet people "to close ranks behind the ideas and aims of perestroika," or 
reform, and warned against ethnic unrest, which it said "has approached a 
dangerous point." 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev focused in his closing remarks on the Soviet economy, which was the 
main topic of discussion during the Congress sessions. 
</P>
<P>
He said he viewed the decision by the Congress to approve the government's 
controversial plan for economic recovery through 1995 to be a vote of 
confidence, "but under certain conditions."

PARAMEDICS, POLICE ATTACKED WITH BOTTLES, ROCKS AS THEY INVESTIGATE SHOOTING 
DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Paramedics and police were showered with rocks and bottles early Sunday when 
they tried to investigate the shooting death of a 25-year-old man in a 
South-Central Los Angeles public housing project, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles Police Detective Bernie Skiles said that although the victim, 
Steven Renell Williams, 25, did not live in the Pueblo Del Rio Housing Project 
on Long Beach Avenue, "he was quite well known and popular there and when we 
tried to preserve the crime scene to assist in finding out who did it, a crowd 
of about 50, both men and women started pitching the rocks and bottles." 
</P>
<P>
Three men were arrested on suspicion of a deadly weapon assault on a peace 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
Policewoman Marvina Herman and Officer Timothy Crass were treated at the scene 
for injuries caused by rocks and returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
Skiles said "it is too early to tell if (Williams' death) involved gang 
warfare."

He said the purpose of his talks with Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh will

TRAIL LEADS TOURISTS TO EPICENTER OF EARTHQUAKE

APTOS, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The 6-mile round-trip trail through Aptos Canyon has become a tourist 
attraction, drawing hundreds of hikers eager to stand at ground zero of the 
deadly and devastating Oct. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"It's awfully crowded. . . . It's swamped," said senior park aide Barbara Louck 
on Sunday, adding that the crunch of curious sightseers was creating problems 
for parking and access to the trail. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exciting place to be," said Bud Getty, superintendent of Forest of 
Nisene Marks State Park. "This was the major quake of people's lifetimes, and 
it really captures your imagination to walk out to the epicenter. You can 
really see the power of the Earth." 
</P>
<P>
A sign posted by Ranger Jerry Waggoner marks the spot about 50 miles south of 
San Francisco that was calculated by latitude and longitude. The site has 
4-foot-diameter redwood trees snapped off at the ground, and a 150-foot-wide 
landslide nearby. Just beyond the epicenter, the trail is closed because of 
danger from new landslides. 
</P>
<P>
"That's enough to convince me," said Pat Wagner, 62, of Burlington, Iowa. "I've 
never been in an earthquake -- and I never want to be." 
</P>
<P>
"Can you imagine what it took to rip these trees out?" asked Julie Dawson of 
Milpitas during a hike to the epicenter last Tuesday. "And can you imagine the 
sound it made? Snap, crackle and pop!" 
</P>
<P>
Dawson said she understands why the previously obscure park site has become so 
popular since the 7.1-magnitude quake that killed 67 people and resulted in $10 
billion in damage. 
</P>
<P>
"I stayed away from San Francisco because I didn't want to be a rubble necker. 
I wouldn't want that in my neighborhood," she said. "But there's no one to 
bother out here." 
</P>
<P>
The walk to the site takes about an hour. Most of the trail is in a deep forest 
where sunlight rarely penetrates. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Nisene Park, other San Francisco Bay Area locations are 
experiencing renewed interest from temblor tourists. 
</P>
<P>
At Point Reyes National Seashore, the 0.6-mile Earthquake Trail leads to the 
epicenter of the 1906 San Francisco quake, and visitors can see a fence 
displaced by fault movement of 16 to 20 feet. 
</P>
<P>
And in Hollister, meeting place of the San Andreas, Calaveras and Hayward 
faults, a self-guided earthquake walk wanders past curbs offset by fault creep 
and buildings damaged in the October earthquake.

MAN IS ARRESTED IN KIDNAPING AND RAPE OF TEEN-AGE JOB-SEEKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An East Los Angeles man was in jail Sunday for investigation of kidnaping a 
16-year old girl on the pretense of finding her a job. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police said Frank Palomino, 37, was arrested Saturday after his 
alleged victim spotted him in another car as detectives were returning her to 
the city from Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Hollenbeck Division Detective John Santy said Palomino, on Thursday, told the 
girl and her aunt that he would take them to places where they could find jobs. 
He dropped the aunt off at one location and then sped off with the girl to 
Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators allege the suspect raped her in a motel room and held her there 
against her will. Despite the presence of another man who was guarding the 
motel room, the girl -- who had come to the United States from her native 
Mexico two months ago -- was able to escape and summon help, Santy said. 
</P>
<P>
After being alerted by Tijuana authorities, two Los Angeles detectives went to 
Tijuana to return her to Los Angeles for questioning, Santy said. As they were 
driving back on Interstate 5, the girl spotted Palomino driving alongside them. 
The detectives pulled the car over and took Palmonio into custody. 
</P>
<P>
He was being held in lieu of $7,500 bail at Parker Center Jail.

and lung disease, as a fuel for space-based interceptor missiles that would be 
deployed under the "Star Wars" missile defense program. 
</P>
<P>
Although beryllium previously has been rejected as a rocket fuel, partly 
because of health concerns, military officials said its use in Star Wars would 
pose fewer risks because the interceptor missiles would be fired in space after 
being carried into orbit by other rockets. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, critics contend that the new fuel would pose a serious health hazard 
if one of the ground launches fails, causing the interceptor missiles to 
explode and releasing a poisonous cloud of beryllium oxide above the launch 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Environmental objections to use of beryllium fuel could deal another blow to 
the embattled Star Wars program, said retired Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll Jr., 
deputy director of the Center for Defense Information, a Washington-based 
watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
"You've got the potential of bringing a whole new element of objection" to Star 
Wars, said Carroll, an outspoken opponent of the program, known officially as 
the Strategic Defense Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
The huge booster rockets that would carry the beryllium-powered interceptors 
into space probably would be launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa 
Barbara County or Cape Canaveral in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Test firings of beryllium rocket motors have already been conducted at a 
Morton-Thiokol installation at Elkton, Md. Additional tests are expected to 
begin within the next two years in a specially designed $4.5-million chamber at 
the Air Force Astronautics Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base near Lancaster, 
military officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's Strategic Defense Initiative Organization has chosen a 
beryllium-hydrogen compound called beryllium hydride as the leading candidate 
to fuel space-based interceptors, said Walt Dyer, SDIO program manager for 
interceptor components. 
</P>
<P>
A lightweight and exceptionally durable metal that is used in a number of 
industrial products, beryllium causes a serious lung disease known as 
berylliosis in chronically exposed workers and is a suspected cancer-causing 
substance. 
</P>
<P>
Aside from beryllium hydride, alternative candidate fuels are beryllium alone 
-- which is not as efficient as beryllium hydride -- and powdered aluminum, 
which is much less toxic than beryllium. 
</P>
<P>
Under one facet of the Star Wars missile defense program, initiated by former 
President Ronald Reagan, hundreds, perhaps thousands, of interceptors would be 
placed in permanent orbit to shoot down enemy missiles. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Pentagon is proceeding with testing of beryllium fuel, the future 
of Star Wars appears uncertain. SDI was a priority of the Reagan 
Administration, but this year the program received reduced funding of $3.7 
billion from an increasingly skeptical Congress. 
</P>
<P>
Faced with growing pressure to cut the military budget, Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney said recently that the program must continue to explore defensive 
technologies at least until 1994, when the President is scheduled to decide 
whether to deploy a missile shield. 
</P>
<P>
Beryllium hydride's major asset is its high efficiency. Dyer said the amount 
needed as a missile propellant would weigh 40% less than other potential fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he said, several hundred pounds of beryllium fuel could be 
contained in the interceptors boosted into space in a single launch. 
</P>
<P>
Dyer said that the Pentagon's SDIO unit has not decided how many launches would 
be needed to put the entire defensive shield into orbit or how many 
interceptors would be included in each launch. The total number of space-based 
interceptors is classified as a military secret. 
</P>
<P>
Independent authorities, however, estimate that scores of booster rocket 
launches would be necessary if the program is carried out. 
</P>
<P>
The propellant weight reduction would be "extremely important . . . since there 
would be lots of these space-based interceptors," Dyer said. He said the weight 
issue "has been the driving consideration" in making beryllium hydride the 
military's first choice for interceptors. 
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview, Dyer said public safety would not be jeopardized by the 
use of beryllium. 
</P>
<P>
Beryllium hydride fuel would be fired only in space, Dyer said, and it will not 
be selected unless studies show that areas around a launch site would not be 
endangered by a toxic cloud should the booster rocket explode or catch fire 
during launch. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon will evaluate worst-case accident scenarios to "determine over 
what area the cloud would land and . . . be sure that that is an unpopulated 
area," Dyer said. "We believe that we can safely utilize these fuels." 
</P>
<P>
Under Air Force rules, all launches at Vandenberg are conducted when winds are 
blowing out to sea. Air Force officials also plot a "toxic hazard corridor" 
before each launch to define the area that could be exposed to falling debris 
or toxic vapors in a rocket explosion, base spokesman Gary Morey said. A launch 
is postponed if the corridor includes populated inland areas. 
</P>
<P>
Data provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shows that 
5% to 10% of unmanned civilian and military launches fail. 
</P>
<P>
The four major rocket families -- Titan, Delta, Atlas-Centaur and Scout -- have 
a combined success rate of 92.6%, with 38 failures in 517 launches since 1960, 
according to NASA. The failures ranged from rockets that deviated from their 
designated courses to launches that blew up. 
</P>
<P>
Members of two Washington-based scientific and environmental groups said the 
use of beryllium fuel on the scale contemplated by the military would be 
extremely dangerous, given the probability of a launch failure. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quite likely that in the process of deploying space-based interceptors, 
you're going to have at least one launch vehicle failure that could result in 
the release of significant amounts of beryllium," said John E. Pike, associate 
director for space policy of the American Federation of Scientists. 
</P>
<P>
"Given the probability of a launch failure," he said, "it's an unacceptable 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
Added Jim Werner, an environmental engineer for the Natural Resources Defense 
Council, an environmental group: "The benefits of this program, it seems to me, 
are dubious at best but the risks are very real." 
</P>
<P>
Studies by the military of the hazard posed by beryllium fuel to people located 
on and off the base after a launch failure are yet to be completed. Lompoc, a 
community of more than 30,000 residents, is about 10 miles from the base's 
launch areas, although some homes are closer. 
</P>
<P>
Safety guidelines set by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial 
Hygienists, a leading occupational safety group, indicate that under conditions 
of chronic exposure, beryllium is more harmful at low concentrations than many 
better-known poisons, including other toxic rocket fuels. 
</P>
<P>
The group's occupational limit for airborne beryllium is 100 times stricter 
than for arsenic; 50 times more stringent than for hydrazine, a common liquid 
rocket fuel, and about 25 times more stringent than for methyl isocyanate, the 
poison gas that killed more than 3,400 people in Bhopal, India, five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
These comparisons, however, apply to routine low-level exposures on the job. 
Most beryllium illness has resulted from such repeated exposures. Some toxic 
gases would be more likely than beryllium to cause severe illness or death in a 
single large dose such as might occur in a catastrophic rocket launch accident. 
</P>
<P>
Berylliosis, the disease caused by beryllium exposure, causes the lungs to 
become more rigid, impairing breathing and, in extreme cases, resulting in 
suffocation. Victims may suffer heart failure from the stress of pumping blood 
through lungs that have lost their normal elasticity. 
</P>
<P>
How Space-Based Interceptors Would Work 
</P>
<P>
A tiny, rocket-propelled missile hurtles toward a Soviet ICBM in this artist's 
conception of a space-based interceptor as defined by Martin-Marietta. Under 
the space-based interceptor theory, carrier vehicles (CVs) would house a 
quantity of the interceptor missiles. A tracking system alerts the CV that a 
missile is approaching and interceptors are fired. The missile, which might be 
powered by beryllium hydride, would maneuver to physically collide with the 
ICBM. The interceptor would have no warhead, but would use the tremendous 
velocity of the collision to destroy the enemy missile.

The editors of Science magazine have for the first time chosen a "Molecule of 
the Year," representative of the most significant scientific achievement. The 
first winner is an enzyme called DNA polymerase that can be used in the 
laboratory for making large quantities of any particular piece of DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid, the genetic blueprint of life) through a process known 
as polymerase chain reaction or PCR. 
</P>
<P>
PCR is revolutionizing genetic engineering by enabling scientists to make large 
amounts of DNA without resorting to the techniques that created the field in 
the first place: inserting a gene into bacteria, growing large quantities of 
the bacteria, and then isolating the desired DNA. While replicating DNA in 
bacteria can require weeks or months, PCR makes replication possible in hours. 
</P>
<P>
The new technique has made it possible to perform genetic fingerprinting on 
single hairs or single cells. It has also been widely used in the search for 
disease-causing genes and in the production of new biological chemicals through 
genetic engineering.

CHRONIC FATIGUE DEBATE STILL GOING STRONG; 
</P>
<P>
RESEARCH: THOUSANDS WHO SUFFER FROM THE SYNDROME, AND THEIR DOCTORS, CLAIM IT'S 
CAUSED BY A VIRUS. BUT RESEARCHERS SAY THE SYNDROME IS RARE, IF IT EXISTS AT 
ALL, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL.

<TEXT>
<P>
Years after it first grabbed headlines and became a popular talk-show subject, 
chronic fatigue syndrome continues to raise more questions than it answers. 
</P>
<P>
Is it a new, media-made illness or is it 100 years old? Is it common or rare? 
In the search for its underpinnings, is medical technology on a witch hunt or 
is science closing in on a complex crippler? 
</P>
<P>
Medical researchers at the University of Connecticut claim to have largely 
answered those questions and helped scores of CFS sufferers recover. 
</P>
<P>
Their finding: chronic fatigue syndrome, formerly known as chronic Epstein-Barr 
virus syndrome, is rare if it exists at all. Most of the patient-reported 
symptoms attributed to the syndrome -- exhaustion, fever, swollen glands, 
disturbed sleep and fogged thinking, all occurring or recurring for months or 
years on end -- are the result of treatable psychiatric disorders, particularly 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
Far from settling the matter, their reports and those by others with similar 
findings have further fueled a heated debate. 
</P>
<P>
"To say this is psychological is bull," snaps Dr. James Jones, a senior staff 
member at the National Jewish Center for Immunology and Respiratory Medicine in 
Denver. He says he has seen nearly 2,000 people suffering from CFS. 
</P>
<P>
Jones has co-authored the CFS "working case definition," arrived at in March, 
1988, after elevated antibodies in response to the Epstein-Barr virus proved to 
be a false lead in the hunt for a cause and an agreed-upon diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
Some researchers argue that CFS sufferers first become physically sick from an 
as-yet-unidentified virus that causes chronic flu-like symptoms. Depression is 
a common symptom of CFS, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as the University of Connecticut researchers, say people with CFS 
symptoms start with a history of recurrent mental illness, including 
depression, panic attacks and other disorders. Their physical symptoms then 
emerge from patients' unspoken "psycho-emotional conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
Both sides in the CFS debate agree that most people who go to doctors 
complaining of persistent tiredness are probably suffering from a treatable 
mental illness, such as depression. 
</P>
<P>
Both sides also agree that CFS, or the illness that people are now calling CFS, 
is probably not a new disease. 
</P>
<P>
Reports of a similar plaguing fatigue, then labeled neurasthenia, first emerged 
in the United States in the mid-1800s, notes Dr. Peter Manu, lead author of the 
studies by the University of Connecticut researchers. 
</P>
<P>
Similar symptoms have since been attributed to Iceland disease, chronic 
brucellosis and, in England, benign myalgic encephalomyelitis, he says. 
</P>
<P>
But here the two sides of the debate part company. 
</P>
<P>
Manu says that neurasthenia, still a common diagnosis in other countries, gave 
way to psychiatric diagnoses in the 20th-Century United States. He thinks it 
was wrongly revived as CFS in America in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
In January, 1985, two articles in the Annals of Internal Medicine reported that 
patients suffering from chronic fatigue showed a persistent infection from the 
Epstein-Barr virus as measured by certain antibody levels in their blood. 
</P>
<P>
In some people, the Epstein-Barr virus causes mononucleosis, with its weeks or 
months of fevers, swollen glands and exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, however, doctors found that some healthy people were walking 
around with the same antibody levels as those people chronically fatigued. 
Morever, many people suffering from what seemed like chronic mononucleosis did 
not show high antibody levels. 
</P>
<P>
But by then it was too late, Manu says. Patients were rushing to doctors, 
newspaper clippings in hand, seeking a physical diagnosis for an illness that 
was probably psychological. 
</P>
<P>
In Manu's view, doctors were too pressed for time to do the extensive 
interviews necessary to make a psychiatric diagnosis. Or perhaps they were 
uncomfortable broaching the idea of mental illness with patients. 
</P>
<P>
Since testing for certain Epstein-Barr antibodies had recently become 
commercially available, doctors were able to give patients the technological 
fix they sought. 
</P>
<P>
Although those antibody counts proved imprecise and largely irrelevant, in this 
age of AIDS, both medical and popular thought focused on a viral cause for 
chronic fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
"Here you had millions of people that for about two years, 1986 to 1987, 
believed they had chronic Epstein-Barr virus, and all of a sudden that was 
taken away from them," Manu says. 
</P>
<P>
"The evidence is that (CFS) need not be produced by a virus but is . . . 
associated with a high prevalence of psychiatric disorders," says Manu, who 
says he has seen 200 patients with the syndrome's symptoms since he and two 
other doctors set up the University of Connecticut's Chronic Fatigue Clinic in 
late 1986. 
</P>
<P>
Not everyone agrees that people catch CFS from magazine articles. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the knee-jerk reaction is to call anything that we don't understand, 
or that we can't prove is organic by the definition of the day or the 
technology of the day, 'psychiatric.' And I don't think that's right," Dr. Paul 
Cheney says. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior staff physician at the Nolle Clinic in Charlotte, N.C., Cheney says 
he has seen 1,000 patients with chronic fatigue in the past three years. He is 
following 500 people from that group, analyzing them over time for immune 
system and neurological abnormalities. 
</P>
<P>
"They have enough objective abnormalities that they could not manufacture 
through psychic means," Cheney says of the majority of those patients. 
</P>
<P>
And he adds, "Between the years 1980 and 1984, the only thing we could find in 
AIDS patients was disturbed immune function and a menagerie of other infections 
that didn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
Both Cheney and Dr. Anthony Komaroff, chief of general medicine at Brigham and 
Women's Hospital in Boston, say they will soon publish studies showing immune 
system dysfunction in CFS patients. 
</P>
<P>
Measurable immune system abnormalities, which Cheney says have been reported in 
other countries' medical journals, could provide a more clear-cut and readily 
accepted diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
But Cheney concedes, "There isn't a single test within this immunologic profile 
that we do that is always abnormal in CFS patients."

TEENS MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO COCAINE, STUDY SAYS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Cocaine may be as much as 12 times more addictive for teen-agers than it is for 
adults, according to psychiatrist Todd Estroff of Glenbeigh Hospital of the 
Palm Beaches. "Typically for adults, it takes two to four years from first use 
to addictive abuse. For teens, this same process can occur in just two to four 
months," said Estroff. He questioned 479 youths aged 14 to 19 who were enrolled 
in long-term outpatient drug abuse treatment facilities. He said 138 had abused 
other drugs but not cocaine and 341 were cocaine users. He found that 55% of 
the intermediate cocaine users and 65% of the heavy users had progressed to 
weekly use of cocaine in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
"This indicates cocaine may have a greater addictive potential among 
adolescents than among adults," he said. Estroff said 60% of teen-age heavy 
abusers went to extreme measures to get cocaine, including theft, drug dealing 
and trading sexual favors. 
</P>
<P>
Daily marijuana use was frequent with all respondents before they began to use 
cocaine, with light users smoking marijuana 52% of the time and heavy users 77% 
of the time. As the addiction progressed, there was a greater tendency to 
experiment with crack cocaine.

WHY CAN'T WE CHEER FOR BLACK AMERICA?; 
</P>
<P>
HOLLYWOOD: THE INDUSTRY SHOULD DO MORE THAN RAKE IN MONEY. IT SHOULD GIVE 
SOMETHING BACK BY PROVIDING HEROES IN MORE THAN ONE COLOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN STEIN, Benjamin Stein is a Los Angeles lawyer and economist. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
And speaking of taking down walls . . . 
</P>
<P>
For most intents and purposes, Hollywood still has up the "white trade only" 
sign for its movies and television shows. While there are certainly far more 
blacks in the mass culture now, they are still largely in the lower depths of 
the alternate reality that Hollywood presents to America, as America. Blacks 
are still largely represented on screen by drug dealers, drug addicts, con men, 
scammers of all kinds, gangsters and, occasionally, frustrated detectives. 
</P>
<P>
With some exceptions, blacks have not traveled far from the land of 
Stepinfetchit -- real-life cartoon figures for whites to laugh at as they get 
clobbered and twisted around, especially by their inability to adapt to the 
white man's world. 
</P>
<P>
But this is a major wrong. The black community in America is in deep crisis. 
Among the basic things it needs is inspiration. Movies and TV shows can deliver 
that inspiration. Movies, especially, can permanently change a viewer's ideas 
of human potential. Think of Audie Murphy on Iwo Jima. Think of Knute Rockne. 
Think of Sigourney Weaver in "Alien." Think of Rocky Balboa. Why can't 
Hollywood deliver this kind of inspiration using black heroes and heroines? Why 
can't Hollywood make us stand up and cheer for black Americans? 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, part of the answer is explicit racism. I know powerful people in 
Hollywood who will purposely not put blacks in their shows for fear of 
depriving white audiences of scenes of perfect, imaginary tranquility. I know 
others who believe that blacks do not deserve to be heroes on the big or small 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever the reasons, Hollywood can and should overcome them. Hollywood 
owes America more than just to rake in money. In this time of domestic crisis, 
Hollywood owes the kind of inspiration that could literally make a lifelong 
impression on masses of demoralized black Americans. Like every other group 
that has prospered in America, the movers and shakers of Hollywood ought to 
give something back. 
</P>
<P>
For example, how about a variant of "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington," starring a 
black? In this version, a black former star athlete would be appointed to the 
U.S. Senate to serve out the term of a deceased lawmaker. On getting there, he 
would serve capably and also as a model to young children in the capital. But 
he would be framed by wicked investment bankers whose special-interest 
legislation he is blocking. He would be made to look like a drug dealer 
himself. Only by dogged, lonely persistence in his innocence, only by reference 
to the great ideals of America as expressed by Jefferson, Lincoln and Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. would he find the strength to carry on his fight. The 
small children of Washington would vindicate him and prove his innocence. When 
they march onto the Senate floor for him, we weep with joy and relief. 
</P>
<P>
How about a movie on any of the black heroes in Vietnam? If the Cold War is 
really over (which I doubt), it is over largely because of the service of 
America's soldiers, sailors and airmen since 1945 on a dangerous, lonely and 
poorly paid vigil. The blood of many thousands of black men was shed in that 
struggle, disproportionately so in Vietnam. Let's stand up and cheer for them. 
</P>
<P>
Let's see the saga of a poor black man who came from the slums of Detroit, who 
might have hated America but saw her promise and saved dozens of his pals, 
including whites, by giving his life in battle in some long-forgotten hamlet in 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Or how about the brave black women who stand up to the drug dealers of the 
projects in Washington, New York and Los Angeles and face MAC-11 automatic 
pistols with simple decency and love for their children? Don't they deserve a 
movie? 
</P>
<P>
Or the black athletes who do not take drugs and play despite incredible pain on 
rainy, cold days? Or the black teachers who stand up to gangs, for no added 
money, to save the children they teach? 
</P>
<P>
Let's take down the wall that Hollywood has put up that separates American 
blacks from sharing their pride through the motivational power of movies and 
TV. They need it, and so does the rest of America.

EDUCATION: CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSITIES ARE TURNING AWAY QUALIFIED APPLICANTS. WE 
COULD EASILY HELP THEM TO ATTEND OUT-OF-STATE COLLEGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOVANNISIAN, Richard Hovannisian, a professor of history at the 
UCLA, has represented California on the Western Interstate Commission for 
Higher Education since 1979. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
We read of California high school students with straight As being denied 
admission to campuses of the University of California. Or we learn of 
individuals who abandon long-held career aspirations because there are not 
enough openings in some of the state's professional schools. 
</P>
<P>
These students are victims of a fierce competition for admission to 
California's public higher-education system -- too many qualified applicants 
and too few openings. 
</P>
<P>
Greater capital and human resources are required. California is moving in this 
direction by expanding programs and facilities, including spending millions of 
dollars for planning and opening of new campuses. But while that long and 
costly process is under way, there are other established and less expensive 
ways available to help California ease some of its enrollment pressures, while 
also extending educational opportunities to its college students. 
</P>
<P>
One approach is to liberalize state financial aid to support California 
students who enroll outside the state. There is precedent for this. Alaska, for 
instance, provides loans for its undergraduate students who attend college in 
another state. 
</P>
<P>
California's public leaders also could take a fresh look at the possibilities 
offered through various student exchange programs administered by the Western 
Interstate Commission for Higher Education, which includes 15 states.

One new and promising program, the Western Undergraduate Exchange, allows 
students from participating states to enroll in undergraduate studies at 74 
campuses for a significantly reduced tuition. 
</P>
<P>
Participation by California in the undergraduate exchange would be in the best 
interest of the state's undergraduate students, since about 10,000 of them 
already enroll each year in colleges in other Western states but must now pay 
much more expensive nonresident tuition. 
</P>
<P>
California can take advantage of this reduced "Western college" tuition by 
offering the special rate to residents of other Western states for some 
selected programs at our own public colleges, universities or higher education 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
In graduate education, 125 selected master's and doctoral programs are open to 
Western students for resident tuition -- again without California's 
participation. California could make all 125 of these graduate programs 
available to our residents if it reciprocated with resident tuition in certain 
distinctive graduate programs. 
</P>
<P>
Another exchange program of the Western Interstate Commission for Higher 
Education, now 36 years old, reserves openings for qualified students in human 
and veterinary medicine, dentistry, optometry and a dozen other professions. 
Using this program, students from several sparsely populated states have a much 
greater chance of being educated in medicine or other health-related 
professions because their home state, in effect, has purchased access for its 
qualified residents. 
</P>
<P>
In all of these exchanges, decisions on admission of students and the 
designation of participating programs and schools would remain in the exclusive 
control of California authorities. 
</P>
<P>
Since the 1950s, California's public and private schools have participated in 
the regional professional student exchange as a "receiver," educating thousands 
from other Western states. 
</P>
<P>
But California has not kept pace with the other Western states in providing 
affordable access to high-quality undergraduate, graduate and professional 
education for its own students who choose to or must enroll outside the state 
to obtain their college degrees. 
</P>
<P>
That time may have arrived.

ENVIRONMENT: TOO MANY CALIFORNIA PLANTS AND ANIMALS FACE EXTINCTION. FOR 
SELFISH REASONS, WE HUMANS SHOULD WORRY ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES.

Two hundred years ago, Los Angeles County was teeming with wildlife, a 
veritable crazy quilt of bio-diversity. The remnants of no fewer than 23 
distinct ecosystems (more than any other county in the state) tell the tale. In 
the Los Angeles basin, grizzly bears ate their fill of rainbow trout, the Los 
Angeles sunflower bloomed alongside countless other wildflowers, the long-eared 
kit fox trotted at night in search of prey. Today, the grizzly bear is gone, 
the Los Angeles sunflower is extinct and the last sighting of the long-eared 
kit fox was in 1906. 
</P>
<P>
Although most people probably regret these losses, they still feel that 
extinction is somehow normal, as in "what happened to the dinosaurs." 
Unfortunately, the rate at which species are now becoming extinct worldwide is 
estimated to be 40 to 400 times "normal." Unless action is taken soon, it is 
two minutes to midnight for more than 900 species of California plants and 
animals, the majority of which depend on habitats in the southern part of the 
state. 
</P>
<P>
For strictly selfish reasons, we humans should worry about the consequences of 
this possible loss. Locked inside these plants and animals is an uninventoried 
treasure chest of compounds that have the potential to cure diseases, increase 
the vigor of domestic species and provide new opportunities to industry and 
agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
In Southern California, the San Diego horned lizard's ability to diet on ants 
whose bites paralyze and kill other small animals could shed light on possible 
anti-toxins for humans. Another Southern California native, the desert pupfish, 
displays evidence of an evolutionary "wonder kidney." It can adapt to fresh 
water or seawater within seconds. One explanation for the pupfish's amazing 
adaptability is that it evolved from the glacier-fed lakes of the ice age to 
the desert water holes of the present environment. Research on the pupfish may 
be of value to the thousands of people who suffer from kidney failure each 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, all this may be academic, since our plant and animal populations 
are dwindling. Reversing this trend is difficult because many Southern 
California species -- the San Diego horned lizard, the southern rosy boa, the 
salt-marsh skipper and more than 50 others -- are "candidate" species. In other 
words, they are imperiled but the necessary paper work to categorize them as 
endangered has not yet been completed. The backlog can be deadly: In America, 
more than 300 species have become extinct while on the "candidate" list. 
</P>
<P>
One problem is that these species are often regarded as obscure or unusual 
evolutionary artifacts of interest only to science. They aren't. They are life 
forms that, until the last 150 years, were thriving in California. They are 
part of our environment, and every one of them counts. 
</P>
<P>
More and more Californians seem to agree. As director of the Nature's 
Conservancy's California program, I have detected a growing recognition in the 
state that our wildlands should be preserved and that they inestimably 
contribute to our quality of life. This decade, our membership has grown from 
15,000 to 90,000; our land acquisition and management efforts have multiplied 
as a result of an unprecedented number of partnerships with the public and 
private sectors. By 1986, the conservancy had been around for 25 years and had 
saved about 150,000 acres. At the end of this year, 400,000 acres will be 
protected. This exponential growth is the result of the conservancy working 
with the Bureau of Land Management, the Wildlife Conservation Board of the 
Department of Fish and Game and with the Department of Defense, as well as with 
countless individuals. 
</P>
<P>
Lacking Europe's centuries of art, architecture and urban life, the 
California's settlers regarded the natural world as their culture as well as 
their livelihood. No surprise, then, that in California you find the first and 
strongest passion for the land as it is. Yosemite, Big Sur, Sequoia -- all are 
testament to this celebration of nature. Now, a similar passion must be ignited 
in Southern California, one that can embrace such subtle landscapes as vernal 
pools, oak woodlands, river forests and coastal marshes. 
</P>
<P>
This campaign can show that economic prosperity is not synonymous with 
wholesale species extinction. For starters, "Sliding Toward Extinction," a 
federal report commissioned in 1987 by the Senate Committee on Natural 
Resources and Wildlife, should be reviewed. It underscores the need to increase 
acquisitions of critical habitats, to offer private landowners tax incentives 
to preserve and restore habitats and to establish legal protection for rare 
natural communities. 
</P>
<P>
In the long run, maintaining the health of our plant and animal populations is 
far less expensive than waiting until intensive care is required to save a 
threatened species. For example, more than $27 million has been spent to nurse 
the condor back from the brink of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
The yellow-billed cuckoo could be the next condor. A magnificent bird cursed 
with a wallflower name, more than 70,000 cuckoos once populated California's 
river forests each summer. Forty nests were counted in the city of Los Angeles 
at the turn of the century. Last summer, fewer than 90 birds were sighted in 
California. To save the cuckoo will require a series of actions, from 
acquisition and restoration of river forests in California to the elimination 
of toxic pesticides from its winter habitat in South America. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike most post-industrial societies, we have the opportunity to value and 
preserve examples of our primeval natural world. In the end, what we as a 
society refuse to destroy will define us as much as what we decide to create.

Noriega's fall from grace was predictable. He knew where all our 
Administration's skeletons were buried. The Panama invasion has to be seen in 
the larger context of a grotesquely bizarre United States foreign policy toward 
Central America in this century. These Latin nations are treated not as 
sovereign states but as witless peasants. For a hundred years we have invaded 
them at will, always under the pretext of saving them from themselves. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, our attitude is racist at heart. We act this way in no other part of 
the world. As Europe, Russia, and the rest of the civilized world move into an 
era of enlightened and humane foreign policy this Christmas, our State 
Department's vision in Central America continues to resemble a pact with the 
devil.

The Soviets pull out of Afghanistan and allow all their "satellites" to freely 
choose their own form of government, be it communist or not. The United States 
stages a massive military invasion of Panama, a tiny sovereign country, and 
installs its chosen candidate as the new head of state. Now which is the "evil 
empire?"

Members of the Panamanian Defense Forces resist the United States invasion of 
their country, and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Colin Powell calls them 
"thugs" and terrorists. United States armed forces invade Panama City at night, 
helicopter gun ships blazing, blow up the Panamanian army headquarters, in the 
process killing dozens of men, women and children living nearby, and untold 
others in streets. Now who are the terrorists?

Until recently, Gen. Manuel Noriega was an asset of the CIA, relied upon for 
assisting U.S. counterinsurgency operations in Central America. He has 
consistently been repressive and corrupt. Yet, only when he became a liability 
for U.S. policy in 1987 did the U.S. government turn against him. 
</P>
<P>
Now President Bush -- who as CIA director was aware of our relationship with 
Noriega -- authorizes the invasion of Panama to impose U.S. foreign (and 
internal political) interests once again. In stark contrast to the dramatic 
peaceful changes sweeping throughout Eastern Europe, Bush's use of military 
force to overthrow Noriega sets a very bad profile for the United States. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military forces should be withdrawn from Panama immediately, in favor of 
diplomatic actions by the United Nations or the Organization of American 
States.

When is it going to end? I was facing the Christmas season and new year with 
joy over the fact that imperialism was in retreat around the world, 
particularly in Eastern Europe. Now I am in despair over what seems to be a 
never-ending story of U.S. military involvement in Central America. 
</P>
<P>
Bush was faced with 10 years of unsuccessful war in Nicaragua. The billions 
poured into the repressive government of El Salvador haven't bought a defeat of 
the FMLN. And even more recently three days of abusive questioning of the woman 
who witnessed the slaying of the priests failed to sway her testimony. Bush's 
wimp image needed bolstering now. 
</P>
<P>
How can we face the international community? By what moral authority can we 
decry the massacres in China or Romania when innocent lives are being wasted in 
Central America? How can we laud the end to imperialism in Eastern Europe when 
we are unwilling to end our own imperialism? Will anyone believe the 
justification of our military action in Panama on grounds of the "war against 
drugs" when there is ample evidence that the CIA actually instigated the Panama 
drug connection? 
</P>
<P>
Today, I am ashamed that we the American public believed George Bush when he 
said that he was going to bring about a kinder and more gentle nation. American 
boys too young to buy a beer are dying while believing in their President, 
Panamanian boys are dying in defense of their country, and innocent civilians 
are being caught in the cross-fire. Where is the kindness and gentleness in 
that?

LATIN AMERICA: THE NEXT GENERATION OF U.S. POLICY PROBLEMS WILL ARISE IN THIS 
HEMISPHERE. WE'VE NEEDLESSLY COMPLICATED THEM BY USING A MILITARY INVASION TO 
SETTLE A SCORE.

Studies in Washington.

<P>
Whatever happens next in Panama, last week's U.S. invasion surely marks the end 
of an era in hemisphere relations. The Latin American future for the United 
States holds only challenges for which this nation and its leaders are 
unprepared -- economically, politically or morally. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. military action to depose Gen. Manuel A. Noriega and to break the power of 
his Panamanian Defense Forces is understandably popular with the American 
people. Beyond Noriega's perversion of his country's political process, he had 
become a symbol of U.S. impotence in dealing with the drug problem. His status 
as a drug trafficker was deliberately inflated by the Reagan Administration, 
which was eager to gain a victory in the drug war it was losing at home. 
Instead, what ensued was national frustration when Noriega refused to play his 
role of vanquished villain. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's significance as a symbol could be seen in Americans' escalating 
anxiety over his evading capture by U.S. forces last week, even though his 
reign and his role in the U.S. drug scene, never more than minor, had ended. 
</P>
<P>
At the level of symbol, Noriega's departure should finish illusions that the 
key to dealing with our drug problem lies abroad rather than at home. At the 
level of substance, this is likely the last time that U.S. military 
intervention will be efficacious in resolving even a temporary problem in this 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
Now the hard part begins, even assuming both a rapid end to Panama's domestic 
chaos and unprecedented success in nurturing democracy from feeble roots. 
</P>
<P>
Panama is unique. It has no left-wing "liberation" movement or right-wing 
"death squads"; neither Fidel Castro nor Daniel Ortega has a foothold there; 
and the United States has had presence aplenty, providing both intelligence 
before invasion and the logistics for carrying it out. Nowhere else in the 
hemisphere -- barring a Grenada-like crisis in another tiny island-state -- 
will these conditions exist. Nowhere else, including El Salvador and Nicaragua, 
can the United States expect to use military force in a short, sharp shock to 
topple a regime and immobilize local military resistance. The actions dictated 
by the Bush Administration last week definitely will exact a price. 
</P>
<P>
Ronald Reagan had fallen into the trap of having his confrontations portrayed 
by Noriega as "gringos vs. Latinos." George Bush avoided that manipulation when 
he responded to Noriega's outrages after Panama's presidential election last 
May. By pressing the issue upon the Organization of American States, Bush 
changed the theme to "democrats vs. dictators." Soon, however, White House 
frustration overwhelmed the effort to teach a valuable lesson to Latin American 
states: that they must help police the region against undesirables. 
</P>
<P>
Today, many Latin Americans are having it both ways: They are rid of Noriega, 
but they have had to take no responsibility for acting. In fact, they have the 
added luxury of criticizing the United States -- although, in some fledgling 
democracies, vulnerable leaders must do this to lessen the taint of ties to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Satisfaction here over last week's bold action poses a further risk: that we 
will put off, once again, coming to terms with Latin America's future. Yet it 
has already become clear that "solving" the Panama problem will require a 
continuing U.S. engagement and a good deal of cold cash. And the size of the 
broader regional challenge is daily demonstrated by the pressure of people 
trying to cross the U.S. border. This time Latin America will not be pushed 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
Like it or not, the United States must secure a broad range of support from the 
Latin countries in an age when the demand for economic progress and political 
growth will far outstrip the supply. And that will begin to happen only when 
the U.S. government learns three things: patience, forbearance and greater 
respect for the forms of hemispheric relations. This means perseverance in 
keeping regional states on the hook (Panama), supporting rather than stifling 
efforts like the so-called Contadora process concerning Nicaragua, and seeking 
the moral high ground whenever possible, even at the price of delay. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that the end of the Cold War is not providing respite but 
revealing a potentially deeper struggle on our own doorstep. Dealing with it 
will demand a commitment of time, attention and resources that most Americans 
will find odious. It will demand massive investment -- first in U.S. society 
and then in neighboring states -- which is mocked by the pledge of "no new 
taxes." These facts may be incompatible with current celebration; but they set 
immutable requirements for the future.

ART: MUSEUM CONSTRUCTION FLOURISHED, PRICES FOR ARTWORKS SKYROCKETED AND 
ARTISTS GOT RICH, BUT CHANGES IN TAX LAW AND NEA RESTRICTIONS PUT A DAMPER ON 
PROGRESS IN THE '80S.

<TEXT>
<P>
They were the Opulent '80s. The visual arts, a once-esoteric subculture, joined 
the real world, reflecting the Reagan era's love of consumption, prestige and 
self-congratulation. We crowned ourselves in a frenzy of museum building and 
filled our cultural cathedrals with the booty of centuries. Artists joined the 
ranks of the rich and famous. Galleries flourished and auction prices ascended 
into the stratosphere. 
</P>
<P>
It was gilded and grandiose, but in the end museum directors feared for the 
future of public showplaces. New York's magisterial Metropolitan had a 1989 
deficit of more than $4 million. Tax laws discouraged donations, and auction 
prices shut down institutional collecting. New art lost its way in a maze of 
cross-purposes, and all art was reduced to a commodity increasingly in the 
hands of private investors seeking status, profit or their very own private 
museums. Some boutique museums worked -- like Houston's smart, soulful Menil 
Museum -- but hearts sank when Armand Hammer jerked his promised collection 
away from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art to build his own monument in 
Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
It looked like the dawn of the Nasty '90s. 
</P>
<P>
What happened? What went right? What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles matured into a meaningful art center and came to symbolize the 
whole caboodle as the home of the world's richest art institution, the J. Paul 
Getty Trust. With an endowment well in excess of $3 billion, it has an annual 
income of about $150 million -- a sum a Saudi prince would have trouble 
squandering. Among many acquisitions was one of the 10 most expensive works 
auctioned. It paid $35.2 million for Jacopo Pontormo's "Halberdier," but Van 
Gogh and Picasso dominated the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles mirrored a Euro-American cultural axis at the apex of Baroque 
splendor. It built museums with the enthusiasm of medieval worshipers. Art 
itself took on the aspect of a weird secular religion. True believers revered 
its relics. The powerful purchased piety through corporate indulgence. The 
artist Hans Haacke blew the whistle on them, the Ralph Nader of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
Angeltown's greening was signaled by the enchanted Olympic year of '84 with its 
cosmopolitan arts festival. The fine arts had a small part in it, but the Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art's lovely Impressionist show, "A Day in the 
Country," captured the mood. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art went through birth traumas. Wrangles over 
architectural control and the loss of its superstar director Pontus Hulten had 
to play out before Richard Koshalek took charge. Now, Arata Isozaki's pretty, 
witty building glitters on Bunker Hill. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Earl A. (Rusty) Powell came from Washington to direct the 
steady-as-she-goes County Museum. Now the museum's new Anderson Building by 
Hardy Holzman Pfeiffer and its Japanese Pavilion by Bruce Goff are as exotic as 
the town, but they echo a phenomenon that swept westward from the Berlin Wall 
to the Pacific Rim. 
</P>
<P>
West Germany probably led the pack, capping its economic miracle with a blitz 
of building, adding nearly 30 new museums by decade's end, including such 
masterworks as James Stirling's muscular Stuttgart Neue Staatsgalerie and Hans 
Hollien's lapidary Stadtisches Museum Abteiberg in Monchengladbach, a burg of 
just 150,000 souls. 
</P>
<P>
Paris gilded its lily with the grandiose art-unfriendly Musee d'Orsay, got it 
right when they housed the legacy of the rebellious Picasso in the 17th-Century 
Hotel Sale and surprised everybody when I. M. Pei's new glass-pyramid entry for 
the Louvre turned out handsome and respectful of its august surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The real spirit of the era began with a national sigh of relief on Inauguration 
Day, 1981, when the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini released American hostages held 
in the Tehran embassy. Self-celebration followed. Art of all stripes acted as 
reassurance that the culture was still rich and powerful even as it felt 
rattled and unsure. The country became conservative and art held up the mirror 
in a revivalist rush into the past. 
</P>
<P>
Art formed cliches of Post-Modernism accompanied by big nostalgic shows devoted 
to the American Renaissance, Louis Comfort Tiffany and decadent Vienna, 1900. A 
paraded pomp of bread-and-circus shows that started in the '70s with "The 
Treasures of Tuthankamun" lumbered on to pretty well culminate with the 
National Gallery's "Treasure Houses of Great Britain" in 1985. By then, rising 
insurance costs and dwindling support had turned such shows, no matter how 
popular, into albino elephants. Some, like the fatuous "The Search for 
Alexander," had been turkeys anyway. 
</P>
<P>
A newer, more nourishing trend was already under way. Serious and revelatory 
surveys of master art proved the most passionate fruit of the decade. Even 
aficionados who had spent their days with noses glued to framing glass were 
astonished by the number of once-in-a-lifetime American exhibitions of great 
old master art: Watteau, Caravaggio, Poussin, Zurbaran, Hals, Velazquez. As 
history moved closer, it focused on the towering figure of Cezanne, the 
heart-stopping testament of Van Gogh, the unavoidable stylishness and exoticism 
of Gauguin. 
</P>
<P>
For Los Angeles viewers, such marvels were both revelation and aggravation 
because witnessing any of them required pilgrimage to Manhattan's Metropolitan 
and Museum of Modern Art and Washington's National Gallery. Los Angeles came a 
long way, but baby we still got a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
We did better -- even astonishingly better -- when it came to totting up the 
short list of the decade's finest modern exhibitions. The originality of a 
revived modern-art program at LACMA ran neck-and-neck with the classicism of 
the Museum of Modern Art. MOMA's great Picasso retrospective, her "Primitivism 
and 20th Century Art" plus "Picasso and Braque," added up to a thoughtful 
probing of fixed tradition. LACMA talked about the present and future in 
exhibitions devoted to near-forgotten, newly relevant movements like the 
Russian avant-garde and Stephanie Barron's German Expressionist sculpture and 
second-generation shows. Maurice Tuchman had the gumption to say that modern 
art had soul in "The Spiritual and Art." The museum reintroduced the dense 
mastery of Max Beckmann in a retrospective no New York museum had the brains to 
book. 
</P>
<P>
Then there was contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Pluralism turns out to be code for "one fine mess." The art of the moment 
became a chaotic tower of Babel with everybody speaking every conceivable 
language but his own. Babylon babbled on in the accents of fashion, 
entertainment, politics and economics, but it was a rare day when there was a 
sign in the window reading "Man Spricht Kunst" or "On Parle Art." In the end, 
art was deemed more interesting if it attached to a current issue like 
perestroika, AIDS or Japan than because it was good. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art became the West Coast flagship of the Now. Not 
fully launched until 1986, it made great strides, buying its core collection 
from Milan's Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo for $11 million and receiving 
bequests from the estates of Barry Lowen and Taft Schreiber. Everyone wished 
MOCA well, but as the artificial curtain came down on the '80s, the museum 
seemed not to have gained traction. A sense of trying to do too many things at 
once echoed the disarray of the larger world of contemporary art. 
</P>
<P>
Bogus movements succeeded one another like mannequins parading down a ramp: 
Neo-Expressionism, the Transavantgardia, New Images, Neo-Geo, Appropriation, 
Deconstructivism. Art was reinternationalized and, for what it's worth, a local 
institution exercised broad influence. A generation of Young Turks from CalArts 
under the guruship of John Baldessari spearheaded art that deals in 
word-associated images and social parody via The Media. 
</P>
<P>
The new power of the press to intervene in shaping popular artistic taste was 
never clearer than in the hot, slow summer of '86, when Time and Newsweek 
carried cover stories about the supposed discovery of a cache of supposedly 
secret paintings by Andrew Wyeth. All depicted his longtime model, Helga 
Testorf. The subtextual implication that the grand old conservative of American 
painting had had an affair was enough to ensure the popularity of a museum 
tour. It had nothing to do with art. It was about the yarn. 
</P>
<P>
International bellwether exhibitions proved there are more artists working than 
anybody can keep track of -- or wants to. Germany's Documenta and the Venice 
Biennale suffered from inbreeding and hollow giantism. After 10 years, only a 
handful of such artists stick in the mind: Anselm Kiefer, Jannis Kounellis, 
Richard Long, Jonathan Borofsky, Christian Boltanski -- to name a few of the 
few. Local examples with talent and apparent staying power are as rare as Jill 
Giegerich. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer, Paris' Pompidou Center organized "Magicians of the Earth." It 
mixed a sprawling melange of jet-set regulars like Nam June Paik with unknown 
Third World folk-style artists and may have been the worst, most incoherent 
circus of the epoch. 
</P>
<P>
Superstar artists flaired and fizzled. A trio of Italians hot at the start were 
half forgotten by the end. Americans like David Salle, Julian Schnabel, Eric 
Fischl and Robert Longo sold in six figures, but after Longo's retrospective at 
LACMA a New York critic wondered if he was washed up with the decade. Green 
talents were launched before they were ready. Jean-Michel Basquiat died from 
it. 
</P>
<P>
Truth to tell, the most memorable art of the '80s came from artists who 
predated it: Frank Stella, Richard Diebenkorn, David Hockney, Lucien Freud, Ed 
Moses, Joe Goode and the artist's architect, Frank Gehry. One of the nicest 
memories comes from '85, when Christo wrapped Paris' ancient Seine bridge, the 
Pont Neuf. Seen at sunset swathed in dull golden fabric, it was like a 
liquefied cocktail of past and present existing in classic harmony. 
</P>
<P>
What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
The culture went greedy, narcissistic, intensely confrontational, contentious 
and short on civility. Fracturing polarization symbolized by, say, the 
agonizing debate over abortion, signals a society that has lost the ability to 
make the distinctions necessary to arrive at a common set of values. 
</P>
<P>
A French poet, I think it was Valery, when accused of being overly cultivated, 
replied that if civilization fails to become more refined it must become 
brutalized. 
</P>
<P>
In the arts, the decade saw a breakdown of distinctions that breached the 
borders between the various arts, a cross-fertilization that revitalized 
architecture and design but impoverished fine art. Even artists who kept the 
faith found themselves confronted by an audience relieved of the burden of 
being attentive to pesky nuances. After all, it's all the same in the end. It's 
all collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Warhol died, but his sardonically innocent insights about American culture 
proved true. Fame and money. 
</P>
<P>
Public Art turned out to be code for vulgarization. 
</P>
<P>
Vulgarity has the virtue of energy and the vice of self-satisfaction. Now that 
art is like everything else, everybody has a shot at it from John Q. Public to 
The Media and Sen. Klaghorn. The decade has shown where that gets us. 
</P>
<P>
Remember the controversy up in the Bay over Robert Arneson's bust of 
assassinated Mayor George Moscone? What about the wrangle over Maya Lin's 
Vietnam Veterans Memorial in D.C., or New York's grinding battle around Richard 
Serra's "Tilted Arc," which was finally removed to the artist's anguish? Around 
here, there was Robert Graham's Olympic Gateway. Critics out to weigh its 
aesthetic worth were surprised at public outrage over pubic specificity. 
</P>
<P>
Remember when the city's manager for cultural affairs, Fred Croton, left the 
post after it was discovered he had exaggerated his qualifications on his 
application? The Getty's respected curator of antiquities, Jiri Frel, was 
allowed to resign quietly after he'd violated museum policies on acquisitions. 
Dreary business. 
</P>
<P>
Gentlemanly John Walsh, director of the Getty Museum, must have been bemused by 
the number of times journalists and dealers besmirched his acqusitions as hot 
or fake. First they went after his Dieric Bouts, then his ancient Greek Kouros 
and a big Aphrodite. Thomas Hoving of Connoisseur magazine led the charge so 
many times it should have gotten funny. Never did. 
</P>
<P>
It does not auger well that the lights go out on a year when the big news was a 
senatorial attack on the National Endowment for the Arts. Hard to forget that 
the Corcoran Gallery did the wrong thing by canceling an endowment-funded show 
of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. Instead of avoiding controversy and 
political interference thereby, they increased it, incensed the art community 
and kicked off a chain of events that ended with legislation restricting 
endowment grants to "obscene or offensive" art, whatever that means. 
</P>
<P>
Means trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Nobody wants to leave a decade on such a sour note. Let's go back to London, to 
the new Clore Gallery for the art of Joseph Mallord William Turner. There is a 
study room there where any citizen willing to wash his fingers can contemplate 
Turner's glorious watercolors, holding them in his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
That's what it's all about.

ART IN THE EIGHTIES; 
</P>
<P>
AN INTERNATIONAL BULL MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The most expensive artwork on record at the end of the '70s was Velazquez's 
$5.5-million painting, "Juan de Pareja." As the '80s draw to a close, that 
dubious honor is held by Van Gogh's "Irises," which brought $53.9 million in a 
1987 auction. 
</P>
<P>
What accounts for the 10-fold rise? 
</P>
<P>
* An injection of new money from American, European and Japanese collectors. 
The Japanese, for example, have inflated the French Impressionist market by 
purchasing vast quantities of paintings at escalating auction prices. One 
Japanese buyer -- Aska International, which operates the Aoyama Gallery in 
Tokyo -- spent more than $120 million in November at New York Impressionist art 
auctions. 
</P>
<P>
* An increase in private collectors who follow the art scene feather their 
nests with artworks and contribute to the image of collecting as a fashionable 
and intellectually rewarding activity. 
</P>
<P>
* A growing belief that art is a good investment, despite hard evidence to the 
contrary. 
</P>
<P>
* A change in income-tax laws in 1986 that reduced deductions of donated art to 
the purchase price instead of the appreciated value. Having lost a tax 
incentive for giving their collections to museums, private collectors began to 
cash in at auction. 
</P>
<P>
* A proliferation of high-quality -- or at least high-profile -- works on the 
resale market. John L. Marion, chairman of Sotheby's New York, dates this 
phenomenon to the 1983 sale of the Doris Havemeyer estate. Each big-ticket 
auction seems to beget others by encouraging collectors to sell. 
</P>
<P>
* Publicity about high auction prices that has raised public awareness and 
built large audiences. As art prices have become front-page news, Sotheby's and 
Christie's have changed from sedate places where dealers did business to forums 
for public spectacles. These activities have filtered down from newspaper and 
television reports to ads for Hughes Markets and Lincoln Town Cars. 
</P>
<P>
All these factors overlap and interact to such a degree that it is difficult to 
track the causes of the art boom. Effects of soaring art prices also can be 
elusive. The major auction houses and the sellers of multimillion-dollar 
artworks are obvious winners in this bull market, as are foundations and 
charities that have benefited richly from big art sales. The trickle-down 
effect on artists and dealers is a matter of hot debate, however. 
</P>
<P>
Among the losers during this money-happy decade are museums, most of which have 
been priced out of the art market at the very moment when reduced income-tax 
deductions have put a squeeze on donations. The J. Paul Getty Museum stands 
alone in its spending power, but even that wealthy institution's budget has 
been cramped by soaring prices. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Getty has emerged as an important collector in the '80s. 
Originally feared for its presumed power to plunder the world's treasures, the 
museum later was chastised for being timid and stingy. In fact, the Getty has 
made big purchases throughout the decade. 
</P>
<P>
As prices have risen, the art market has become increasingly global. Sotheby's 
in 1988 staged a landmark auction of Russian avant-garde and Soviet 
contemporary art in Moscow. This year, Christie's launched a joint venture 
operation in Hong Kong, while Sotheby's joined the Japanese department store, 
Seibu, in a Tokyo auction. 
</P>
<P>
Big changes are also afoot in Europe. Paris has lagged well behind New York and 
London in art sales because of protectionist policies, but reforms are already 
under way and Paris is expected to open up to foreign sales after 1992. Both 
Christie's and Sotheby's are gearing up for action there. 
</P>
<P>
Whether prices rise or fall, global growth is likely to be the big art market 
story of the '90s.

"Because of the complexities involved in public art, there is definitely a 
danger of the ideas getting watered down. For a work in a public space to be 
successful, it's absolutely necessary for it to maintain its strength and 
integrity. At the same time, the artist must acknowledge the needs of the 
situation." -- Mary Miss, New York sculptor, in ARTnews

Back on the 'Far Side': New installments of the cult comic strip "The Far Side" 
will return to newspapers across America on New Year's Day, following a 
14-month hiatus. Cartoonist Gary Larson took a break on Oct. 30, 1988, from one 
of the most successful panels in comic-strip history. During that time, 
newspapers ran reprints of earlier "classic" cartoons. The only thing Larson 
drew on his sabbatical was an album cover for jazz guitarist Herb Ellis -- in 
exchange for guitar lessons. "I feel very fresh and recharged, and I'm sure a 
reduced work load will play a big role in maintaining that feeling," Larson 
said. "But, as I'm sure anyone who has had an opportunity to take a full year 
off will agree, that first Monday morning back at work is quite a sobering 
experience." DANIEL CERONE and SHAUNA SNOW

'911' to the Rescue: Glenn and Annie Murphy of St. Louis saved the lives of 
their children as a result of watching an installment of CBS' "Rescue 911" in 
Annie Murphy's hospital room. Annie Murphy, under observation for a mysterious 
illness, was watching the show when the couple realized her symptoms mirrored 
those of an elderly woman who had become ill from a gas leak at her home. Glenn 
Murphy rushed home to find three children unconscious and one disoriented; he 
rushed them to the hospital and all family members have recovered. DANIEL

Schuller to Broadcast Soviet Sermon: Television evangelist Robert Schuller said 
Sunday he would make the first Christmas sermon ever broadcast to the Soviet 
people by a non-Russian clergyman. Schuller said he was notified by officials 
of the Soviet state television network that his address was to be broadcast 
Sunday evening. Schuller, who is best known for his Crystal Cathedral in Orange 
County, taped his Christmas message Dec. 8 during a visit to Moscow. DANIEL

RYAN A HEAVY AGAIN IN 'DANCE OF DEATH'; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: MANY OF HIS ROLES HAVE A BRUSQUE, HE-MAN QUALITY. 'THE HEAVIES ARE 
MEMORABLE, AND USUALLY THEY'RE GOOD PARTS,' HE SAYS. 
</P>

"I've played a lot of great heavies," said Mitchell Ryan. He's playing another 
heavy in August Strindberg's "The Dance of Death,", at Los Angeles Theatre 
Center under the direction of Alan Mandell. 
</P>
<P>
"He's very savage -- a hurt, sick, devious rat," said the actor of his role as 
Edgar, an artillery captain locked into a volatile 25-year marriage to Alice 
(Marian Mercer). "After 90 years, Strindberg is still on the nose for 
marriages. Of course, he's taken it to the nth degree. But if the problems of 
marriage were acted out more, this is what would develop. There's this game 
they play -- 'You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours' -- which is just the way 
that life is." 
</P>
<P>
Ryan knows whereof he speaks. A veteran of two divorces, he is also a veteran 
of this play -- except that when he did it with Viveca Lindfors and Rip Torn in 
1970 at Arena Stage in Washington, he played Edgar's younger friend, Kurt, the 
third side of the triangle that is the focus of the play. "They bounce off each 
other," said Ryan, 55. "But the roles are very different. Kurt is passive and 
the captain is very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
There does seem to be that brusque, he-man, often sinister quality to many of 
his roles. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't always play heavies -- and I still don't always do them," said the 
gravel-voiced actor. "It's just that the heavies are memorable, and usually 
they're good parts." He quips that as a result of his numerous square-jawed 
mili tary roles. "People come to attention when I walk by." 
</P>
<P>
After living hand-to-mouth on New York stage roles (including "Othello," "The 
Price," "Medea" and "Baal") in the '50s and '60s, two stints on daytime soaps 
("All My Children" and "Santa Barbara") made Ryan an object of mass recognition 
in the mid '80s. "You can't even go to shopping malls," he said grumpily. "And 
I like going to malls. The number of people who watch those things is 
incredible. And they always call you by your character's name." 
</P>
<P>
He has no illusions, however, that this status resembles stardom. "I was 36 
years old, touring with Salome Jens in 'A Moon for the Misbegotten,' when they 
offered me this movie," he said, referring to the 1970 Western "Monte Walsh." 
"So I said 'OK, guys.' But I never had a game plan. Stars make plans. (Paul) 
Newman had a plan, (Robert) Redford had a plan, Tom Cruise has a plan. It's all 
mapped out. There are very few accidents." 
</P>
<P>
There is no jealousy in his tone. The eyes are narrowed, but there is no 
discernible emotion behind them. "Since I never became a star, I've never 
gotten any real money," he stated. "I got a good salary, but never got any 
bucks. They'd offer a part to Bob Mitchum or somebody and they'd turn it down, 
so they'd get me for a third of the money -- which was still a lot of money. 
And the parts, like 'Patton' or 'The Margaret Bourke-White Story,' were really 
nice things." 
</P>
<P>
Yet there's also been a lot of inevitable down time between projects. Does it 
make him nuts? 
</P>
<P>
"Nah. I play tennis, do a little painting, get divorces." If one wonders at 
Ryan's apparent lack of concern -- or aggression -- he isn't ruffled. "I don't 
know that it has to do with being lazy or being afraid or taking the easiest 
route." 
</P>
<P>
Did he ever work too much? "This year I did. In January, I did nothing. Did 
nothing in February, nothing in March or April. In May I did a little TV show, 
in June another one. And then I did this play." He looks up, pleased with his 
little joke. 
</P>
<P>
In a moment, however, he's serious again. "What do I think about for my future? 
Well, it's getting close to retirement time. So you start thinking about the 
end of your career, rather than the beginning of it. I'm getting character 
parts now, less leading men. I remember getting this great script and thinking, 
'This is wonderful. Why didn't they get Redford?' -- and then suddenly 
realizing that they wanted me for the father." 
</P>
<P>
He sighed. "That's what I am. I'm three times older than most of these guys. 
But then I walk down the street and see a picture of Kevin Kline playing 
'Hamlet' and I say, 'That pipsqueak.' I also say, 'Jesus, I'll never get to 
play 'Hamlet' again. I'm too old to play 'Hamlet.' But that happens to 
everybody. One day you realize you're a little older -- even though your 
insides haven't changed. They're still as immature as ever."

ACTION/ADVENTURE DOESN'T RATE WITH THE NEW 'DAYS OF OUR LIVES' 
</P>

"Days of Our Lives" took a big gamble in 1988. In an effort to boost the show's 
mediocre ratings, the powers-that-be came up with a plan to incorporate 
action/adventure into the show's usual romantic story lines. 
</P>
<P>
"We were trying to do a better show," says Al Rabin, who recently returned to 
the helm as the supervising executive producer. "We tried to keep the romantic 
aspects of the show and add an element of adventure. But the reality is you can 
only do so much." 
</P>
<P>
Apparently so. Instead of gaining more viewers, scores fell by the wayside. The 
show dropped to eighth place in the Nielsen ratings. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the audience became an observer as opposed to a participant," notes 
Rabin. "It's essential that the audience be able to share a feeling with the 
characters that they like. As soon as you start doing action/adventure stories, 
the viewers start to just watch it as opposed to feeling it." 
</P>
<P>
As of January, it will be out with the new and in with the old. "Days of Our 
Lives" will direct all of its attention toward telling love stories. Anne 
Schoettle will take over as head writer with Richard J. Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Exactly what is going to be happening in the near future? 
</P>
<P>
"Patch (played by Stephen Nichols) and Kayla (Mary Beth Evans) will be having 
their baby sometime in February, which certainly should be a major event," says 
Rabin. "Then, there is Shane (Charles Shaughnessy) and Kimberly (Patsy Pease). 
The rekindling of that romance will be important. What will happen with Justin 
(Wally Kurth) and Adrienne (Judi Evans) is a major beat, as is the April (Lisa 
Howard), Nick (George Jenesky) and Mike (Michael Weiss) triangle. There will be 
emphasis on Scott (Rick Hearst) and Faith (Mindy Clarke)." 
</P>
<P>
One pivotal character will be returning in February -- the popular Julie 
Williams. And Susan Seaforth Hayes will be recreating her former role as the 
exciting and recently divorced granddaughter of the Hortons. 
</P>
<P>
"Julie will come back as a woman of wealth and power," explains Rabin. "She'll 
probably be an adversary to Victor Kiriakis (John Aniston)."

'MERRY CHRISTMAS' STARTS EARLY WITH DISNEY PARADES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
After unwrapping gifts and welcoming relatives, viewers who turn to the small 
screen for their holiday cheer will find a variety of Christmas-themed programs 
today. 
</P>
<P>
For early risers, ABC has "Walt Disney World's Very Merry Christmas Parade," a 
two-hour telecast starting at 7 a.m. on Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42. Hosted by 
Joan Lunden and Alan Thicke, the program features a host of Disney characters 
taking part in parades along the streets of Walt Disney World and Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
At 9 a.m., a pair of programs focus on the religious aspect of the holiday. 
"The Hope of Christmas," an hourlong NBC special airing on Channels 4, 36 and 
39, presents services from across the country, the Soviet Union and East 
Germany. Meanwhile, "Christmas at Washington Cathedral" covers a celebration of 
Mass from the nation's capital on KCAL Channel 9 and Channel 69 in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Back on the parade route, KTLA repeats November's Hollywood Christmas Parade at 
10 a.m. (5), while KTTV follows the 44th annual Yuletide parade in South Gate 
at noon (11). 
</P>
<P>
Viewers with a preference for traditional sounds of the season can switch to 
public television throughout the day. 
</P>
<P>
Atop that list of musical telecasts is "Bernstein in East Berlin," a 
performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony conducted by Leonard Bernstein. The 
90-minute special begins at noon (50)(15)(24), with KCET airing it at 8 p.m. 
(28). 
</P>
<P>
Other seasonal specials include KCAL's annual showing of "The Nativity," with 
Placido Domingo and the late Grace Kelly, at noon (9), and "A Child's Christmas 
in Wales" at 4 p.m. (28). 
</P>
<P>
On the movie front, there's a choice at 3 p.m. between "The Homecoming -- A 
Christmas Story," the 1971 pilot for "The Waltons" starring Patricia Neal and 
Richard Thomas on (2), and a truncated two-hour version of Frank Capra's "It's 
a Wonderful Life" on (4). Unedited screenings of the 1946 James Stewart classic 
can be seen at 1:30 p.m. (56); 9 p.m. (cable's Disney Channel and Lifetime), 
and 9:30 p.m. on cable's AMC and WGN. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sound of Music," the Oscar-winning Rogers and Hammerstein musical with 
Julie Andrews about the Von Trapp family, returns at 8 p.m. (4)(36)(39). 
</P>
<P>
Sports plays a prominent role as well on today's TV schedule. 
</P>
<P>
A college football double-header on ABC opens with the Blue/Gray All-Star game 
at 9 a.m., followed by the pairing of Hawaii (8-2-1) and Michigan State (7-4) 
in the Aloha Bowl from Honolulu at 12:30 p.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
Then kicking off at 7 a.m. and running until 11 p.m., cable's SportsChannel 
carries edited broadcasts of six Notre Dame football games from this season, 
including the former No. 1-ranked team's match-up against USC (11 a.m. and 9 
p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
Of interest to local fans is a 12-hour Prime Ticket marathon of football 
highlights from USC-UCLA contests of the past decade airing between 11 a.m. and 
11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the National Football League's final regular-season game, the Minnesota 
Vikings play host to the Cincinnati Bengals on "Monday Night Football" at 6 
p.m. (7)(3)(10)(42). 
</P>
<P>
And on the basketball court, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Atlanta Hawks square 
off down South in the Omni at 12:30 p.m. (2)(8).

PICKING AWAY -- NIGHT IN, NIGHT OUT -- AT THE SKY; 
</P>
<P>
ASTRONOMY: TECHNICIANS AT PALOMAR OBSERVATORY SLOWLY CHART THE SKIES, TO DIRECT 
ASTRONOMERS IN SEARCH OF ANSWERS TO THE UNIVERSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
This is the drudgery that leads to scientific discovery: the incessant clacking 
of a motor, a technician licking the cream center from a split Oreo cookie, and 
another talking at 4 in the morning about soap operas. 
</P>
<P>
A third worker suggests a soap opera title that would mirror life here, at the 
Palomar Observatory: "As the Dome Turns -- The Continuing Saga." 
</P>
<P>
As she laughs, the dome is turning: the spherical roof above the 48-inch Oschin 
telescope atop Palomar Mountain. A 14-inch-square piece of chemically treated 
glass is being exposed for more than an hour to the night sky as the telescope 
moves almost imperceptibly so the star images won't be blurred by Earth's own 
rotation. The clack-clack-clack is the sound of electrical relays as motors 
nudge the telescope ever so slightly upward and to the right. 
</P>
<P>
Night in, night out -- except for Christmas Eve and Christmas Night -- these 
specially trained telescope and photographic technicians gather to soak in 
Palomar Mountain's most glorious view -- not the pines and grazing meadows and 
gloriously blue sky by day, but the never-ending speckles of galaxies, quasars, 
asteroids and stars framed by the black sea of night, far too faint to be seen 
by the unassisted eye. 
</P>
<P>
These are celestial cartographers documenting the northern sky, preparing a 
sort of Thomas Guide of the stars that will serve as a reference atlas to 
direct astronomers around the world as they search for answers to the universe. 
</P>
<P>
The ones who work here are not formal astronomers with doctoral degrees. They 
were hired for their various technical expertise, trained on the job and paid 
about $25,000 a year to photograph the night sky for later inspection, not 
unlike a nurse preparing the patient for a physician's scalpel. 
</P>
<P>
The quiet, hiccup routine of a night within the 22-year-old dome -- peaks of 
activity separated by tiresome stretches of whiling away the hours -- belies 
the scientific discoveries that are probably being made. The place doesn't have 
the aura of astronomy at the vanguard. In a downstairs office, below the dome's 
telescope, there's only one computer -- the kind you can buy off the shelf in 
an electronics store. 
</P>
<P>
There are no video display terminals allowing a glimpse into what the telescope 
itself is seeing -- just a darkroom where the glass negatives are carefully 
developed, dried and packed for shipment to the California Institute of 
Technology in Pasadena for later inspection. A refrigerator is stocked with 
soda and a couple of frozen dinners. The microwave oven is mostly for popcorn. 
Hardly high-glitz stuff. 
</P>
<P>
The Oschin telescope is no headline grabber. The Sky Survey started two years 
ago, and, after some false starts, about 500 plates have been successfully 
exposed. The survey won't be completed until the mid-1990s. Not much breaking 
news here. 
</P>
<P>
But someday -- maybe in a week, maybe in 10 years -- an astronomer will inspect 
one of the exposed glass negatives and probably discover a heavenly body never 
before spotted by the human eye, expanding our knowledge of the universe. 
</P>
<P>
It's 5:30 p.m. and the moon has set, half an hour behind the sun, giving way to 
a black, cloudless sky -- perfect conditions for some astronomical work. 
</P>
<P>
Jean Mueller, Cindy Brewer and Dave Mendenhall are in an office below the 
Oschin telescope, which was put to work in 1947 as an instrument specifically 
designed to photograph the stars. Unlike the neighboring and more famous 
200-inch Hale telescope, through which the universe's most distant and faint 
objects can be detected and studied, the Oschin is a wide-angle telescope that 
provides broader vistas of the sky. 
</P>
<P>
The full moon would fill up the Hale's view of the sky. But a sky view 13 moons 
wide can be photographed through the Oschin's 48-inch lens opening. Despite the 
wider view, Mueller, Brewer and Mendenhall will still need to take 894 pictures 
of the northern sky to complete their celestial scrapbook, so that astronomers 
on more narrowly focused missions will know where to train their larger 
telescopes. They'll take two more rounds of photos -- with different filters, 
in order to detect stars emitting different colors of light -- for a final 
complement of 2,682 pictures. 
</P>
<P>
Under the best of circumstances -- a long, dark, cloudless night -- six 
pictures can be taken. That makes it a frustratingly slow process, but Mueller 
says the rewards, however esoteric, are mind-boggling. 
</P>
<P>
"You know for a fact you're seeing objects never seen before by a human," she 
says. "That's instant gratification." 
</P>
<P>
Mueller will spend part of the night comparing the newly exposed photographic 
plates with ones taken 35 to 40 years ago, when the first survey was conducted. 
Because of advances not only in the hardware of the telescope but, more 
important, in the Kodak film emulsions, objects that were three or four times 
too faint to have been spotted in the late 1940s and early '50s can now be 
photographed. Put another way, the new film material allows the Oschin to 
detect, in rough terms, objects twice as far away. 
</P>
<P>
How many more celestial objects will now be found remains to be seen; it will 
take years for scientists around the world years to pore over the plates being 
exposed by the nighttime trio. 
</P>
<P>
By comparing the findings of the new survey to the first one, astronomers will 
also be able to determine just how the structure and mass of the Milky Way has 
shifted over the years. 
</P>
<P>
"I have no doubt that discoveries will be made on these plates 15 years from 
now," Mueller says. "It depends on what the people will be looking for. But 
these plates will be keeping astronomers busy for generations to come." 
</P>
<P>
They're exposing their first plate for the evening so they can make sure the 
instrument is in focus for the night's work. 
</P>
<P>
The plate sits in a frame in the middle of the telescope's tube, catching the 
light that enters the lens of the scope and is collected by the 72-inch 
spherical mirror at the bottom. The mirror focuses the light rays back up the 
tube, onto the glass plate coated with chemicals to preserve the photons of 
light. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of the new-age photo emulsions -- which produce 
high-resolution negatives -- require exposures of an hour or longer and 
supersensitive developing techniques that last two hours from start to finish. 
But the most critical and difficult work, Mueller says, is in making sure the 
picture is in focus. 
</P>
<P>
The photographic plate must be placed within 30 microns, or one-tenth the 
thickness of Scotch tape, of the optimum position within the telescope's tube 
in order for the light rays to be in pinpoint focus. Even a piece of dust in 
the plate's frame, or the changing night temperature on the glass itself, can 
affect that focus. So throughout the night, the telescope may be adjusted by 
mere microns. 
</P>
<P>
The first plate is now developed. Mueller puts it beneath a microscope, takes 
some readings and telephones the information upstairs to Mendenhall, who pushes 
a button on the telescope's control panel to place the frame correctly within 
the telescope tube, for the first Sky Survey exposure of the night. 
</P>
<P>
Back downstairs, Brewer flips through a computer printout showing, in columns 
of numbers, the nightly coordinates of locater stars that the telescope will 
home in on to photograph that particular piece of the sky. She picks a star in 
a sky field that has not yet been photographed, and sends the coordinates 
upstairs to Mendenhall. He twirls a dial on the telescope's auto-guidance 
gizmo, then pushes a button that swings the telescope into position. The slit 
in the dome follows suit. A smaller telescope attached to the larger one finds 
the target star, and locks in to its brightness so it can track it during the 
exposure. Everything is set; the lens is opened, and Mendenhall, working in 
virtual darkness, walks downstairs into the warm office, where he'll kick up 
his feet and work his way through Carlos Castaneda's "The Eagle's Gift." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer now peers at a readout that shows the rate of light photons hitting the 
glass plate. Based on that, she determines the exposure time on the plate to 
that part of the sky -- an exposure that changes based on how bright that part 
of the sky is that night. 
</P>
<P>
It is just after 6 p.m. They will be here for 12 more hours. 
</P>
<P>
Despite all the high-tech care, mistakes, while rare, sometimes happen. 
</P>
<P>
Like the time they forgot to take the giant dust cover off the lens -- an error 
that went unnoticed until the blank plate was developed. (After all, you never 
actually look through the telescope itself during an exposure.) 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they forgot to throw the switch so the dome and telescope would 
move in sync with Earth's rotation. 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they put the film frame in backward, or the time they put the glass 
plate into the frame, but forgot to raise the frame into the telescope so it 
could be exposed. 
</P>
<P>
Or the time they forgot to close the box of unexposed glass plates when the 
lights were turned on. 
</P>
<P>
Danger. Humans at work. 
</P>
<P>
It's 7:30 p.m. and Mendenhall drives over -- with only his car's parking lights 
shining his way so he won't pollute the darkness -- to the nearby lodge -- 
nicknamed "The Monastery" -- to snatch some Oreo cookies. The Monastery houses 
visiting astronomers and graduate students, who sleep by day while working at 
the mountain's other telescopes. 
</P>
<P>
Brewer and Mueller, who are on the observatory staff full time, live in their 
own small cabins on the observatory campus. Mendenhall also is an observatory 
employee, as opposed to a visiting scientist, but lives a few miles away in his 
own mountaintop ranch home, where he helps manage the family cattle business. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being part of scientific discovery," says the 30-year-old Brewer, an 
Iowa girl who spent 19 years in the Navy as an electronics technician, training 
that serves her well here. When she got out of the Navy, she sought out Palomar 
Mountain's solitude because she basically doesn't like being around crowds of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
She works a shift of 10 nights on, four nights off. She sees her husband, still 
serving in the Navy and stationed in Long Beach, only on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
She likes being up here, virtually unsupervised by the actual astronomers who 
work at Cal Tech, which owns Palomar Observatory. "We'll probably never see 
astronomers inside here," she said. "To do quality work, we need the same 
regimen. That's why we're the same ones doing it night in, night out. The 
astronomers may send down orders to us about shooting a particular sky field 
because there's been a request for one in particular. But essentially we're on 
our own, doing our job." 
</P>
<P>
Now it's 8:15. Mendenhall, back from his cookie run, is upstairs, putting in 
the night's second glass plate. The phone rings on the control board. "Is 
Felipe there?" Wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
In the downstairs darkroom, the first Sky Survey exposure of the night -- a 
look through a spiral arm of our own Milky Way -- has been developed, and 
Mueller cringes. Across the frame are two dark streaks -- the lights of an 
airplane that flew 10,000 feet overhead. An untold number of previously 
undiscovered galaxies millions of light-years away may have been obliterated by 
an airplane bound for Ontario or March Air Force Base. Two hours of work -- and 
a $100 photographic plate -- down the tubes. The plate is unusable. 
</P>
<P>
8:40 p.m. A consolation bag of popcorn is taken out of the microwave and 
there's general complaining because a lot of the kernels didn't pop. 
</P>
<P>
Even the astronomers making heralded discoveries at the neighboring, 200-inch 
Hale -- the world's most valuable land-based tool for inspecting deep space -- 
look to the little guy next door, the 48-incher, for help. 
</P>
<P>
"Without it, we'd be lost," said J.B. Oke, who, along with fellow Cal Tech 
astronomer Marshall Cohen, is in the computer control room of the more famous 
Hale, studying the evolution of distant galaxies. "It gives us the road map so 
we know were to look." 
</P>
<P>
The Oschin is "the most-used astronomical instrument in the world," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Brucato is the assistant director of Palomar Observatory; he spends some 
time here and some time at his main office in Pasadena. "So much of science is 
perceived to be gee-whiz stuff, the 'Eureka! I found it!' " he says. "But the 
real progress is made through the drudgery of picking away at the sky, piece by 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
"When the 200-incher was being designed, we didn't know what the sky looked 
like and what limits the 200-incher would reach. It was like navigating without 
a map. We didn't know where to look. So we built the 48-incher to help us." 
</P>
<P>
The first Sky Survey was conducted between 1947 and 1956; those photographs 
have since been shared with more than 100 astronomers worldwide, who use it as 
a reference guide to zero in on their particular work. 
</P>
<P>
Given advances in both the construction of telescope lenses and the chemical 
makeup of photo emulsions, the new survey will provide more celestial street 
signs and landmarks for astronomers. 
</P>
<P>
The Hale telescope now "reads" the light in space through a 3-inch-square 
electronic device covered by 6 million ultra-light-sensitive silicon chips -- 
which is then converted digitally by a computer to shades of black and white 
and transferred to a video monitor. The Oschin produces images of space the 
old-fashioned way, through black and white photos. 
</P>
<P>
A similar survey -- this one of the southern sky -- is being conducted in 
Australia, so astronomers will be gifted with an all-encompassing, updated sky 
map. 
</P>
<P>
It's 10:15 p.m. The second plate of the night has been developed -- showing 
this time not one but three separate airplanes having crossed above the 
telescope, leaving six black lines as unwanted souvenirs. "Shoot!" Mueller 
exclaims. O-for-2 on what were otherwise perfect exposures. 
</P>
<P>
It's not too unusual for the first exposure of the night to be ruined by an 
airplane, but two bad plates causes audible irritation. 
</P>
<P>
Astronomy is Mueller's life. The 39-year-old former librarian pores over the 
negatives as they come out of the wash, and is typically back at the dome even 
on her days off to further scrutinize the plates. 
</P>
<P>
Mueller has discovered 10 supernovas, four asteroids and a comet that now 
carries her name. It's due to fly by Earth again in late 1995. "I was just 
scanning the plate, and there it was," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"When you inspect the plates, you almost can't think about what you're looking 
at, because it would be so overwhelming," she says. "When you realize how much 
is out there, it keeps us in our place." 
</P>
<P>
Brewer offers a similar perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You look at plate after plate of stars and galaxies that go on forever and get 
fainter and fainter and fainter," she said. "It's mind-boggling. I'm not a 
religious person, but it makes you think about God. What if the big-bang theory 
is just bunk? What if God just threw out his arms one day and there it all 
was?" 
</P>
<P>
Mendenhall, 46, a quiet, no-nonsense man, began working at the observatory 10 
months ago. He's a fourth-generation mountain resident who, as a child, dreamed 
of working inside one of the domes. Having worked the family ranch and having 
spent 10 years as an air traffic controller, he was hired for the Sky Survey 
earlier this year because of his high-tech mechanical expertise. 
</P>
<P>
"I like this project because it's finite, with a specific goal," he says. "It's 
been done only one time in history, and this may be the last time. I want to be 
a part of it." With a smile, he adds boyishly: "I like to make the telescope 
go." 
</P>
<P>
An Oscar Wilde quote is printed on a placard stuck to the wall of the office: 
"We are all lying in a gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars." 
</P>
<P>
It's half-past-midnight. The third plate has been developed -- and it, too, is 
marred by the lights of yet another airplane. Mueller debates whether to go for 
the chicken or linguine frozen dinner. Linguine it is. Mendenhall has his feet 
up on the desk, eyes closed. Brewer just sits there, looking at the readout of 
the rate of photons exposing the plate like some late-night movie. 
</P>
<P>
Boring. 
</P>
<P>
2:17 a.m. The fourth plate came out fine, with no airplane streaks. Finally, a 
decent exposure! The fifth plate is now being exposed. It will be finished at 
3:25. Is there time for a sixth plate? "We have until 5:15 to finish that 
exposure," Mueller says. "Piece of cake." 
</P>
<P>
3:50 a.m. Mendenhall is working his way through "The Eagle's Gift." Brewer is 
filling out the log sheet for the night's exposures. Mueller is developing the 
fifth plate. It's 42 degrees upstairs in the dome. 
</P>
<P>
4:45 a.m. "Our last exposure will be done five minutes before astronomical 
twilight," Brewer says. "It looks like we're going to eke out every photon out 
of the night sky. The photons are crying out for immortality on our plates." 
</P>
<P>
Getting a little punchy now. 
</P>
<P>
5:02 a.m. The fifth plate is developed and looks great. No airplane streaks. 
The sixth and final plate of the night is now out of the telescope and in the 
developer. Mendenhall goes upstairs, secures the telescope, closes the dome and 
goes home, his chores done for the night. "When I wake up," he says, "I'm going 
to do some real work. Cut firewood." 
</P>
<P>
At 5:31, Mueller is looking at the last plate and her attention is drawn to a 
particularly bright galaxy. "Oooooh!" she coos to no one in particular. "Maybe 
I'll come in tomorrow after all." It's supposed to be her day off. 
</P>
<P>
The night's score card: Out of six plates, three are ruined by airplanes and 
three are keepers. It's now nearly 6 a.m.; the eastern sky is turning a blood 
red. Distant roosters are announcing the new day, and the surveyors of the 
stars are calling it a night.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: SLAIN MAN FOUND AT PICNIC GROUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man was found shot to death Saturday at the Pyramid Lake picnic 
grounds, the Los Angeles sheriff's department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The man, who was in sitting position against a wall separating the picnic area 
from a parking lot, was found about 3:15 p.m. by a group of fishermen, said 
Sheriff's Sgt. Bruce Sonnenblick. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities at first thought the man, age 35 to 40, had died of natural causes. 
But a coroner's deputy later found a single bullet wound in his chest, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The body was fully clothed. Homicide detectives are investigating, said 
Sonnenblick.

UNION-TRIBUNE EMPLOYEES TO STAGE 'WORKING STRIKE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Employees of the San Diego Union and Tribune had no immediate plans to strike 
Sunday evening, but a member of the San Diego Newspaper Guild said job actions 
will begin Tuesday that will constitute a "working strike." 
</P>
<P>
"People in every department will be doing everything they can that's legal to 
show management that they depend on our good will," said Ed Jahn, guild 
president. "Some people may refuse to use their personal cars for work-related 
assignments. Others may stop writing their stories at 5:30, when their shifts 
are over." 
</P>
<P>
Jahn said a rally has been planned to take place inside the Union-Tribune 
building Tuesday, but he declined to give specifics. 
</P>
<P>
"We have never condoned vandalism or intimidation tactics," he said. "On the 
other hand, management has to know that we're human beings, and when people get 
wrapped tight or humiliated, they may react as they see fit." 
</P>
<P>
Herbert Klein, editor in chief of Copley Newspapers, publisher of the morning 
Union and the afternoon Tribune, said: "Whatever they're going to do, we'll be 
prepared to handle it. I would presume that their professionalism will 
prevail." 
</P>
<P>
Guild members have worked without a contract since June, 1988. No negotiations 
have been held between the Union-Tribune management and the guild since talks 
broke off early Saturday, when, shortly before 12:30 a.m., negotiators for 
Copley Newspapers rejected a guild proposal for a three-year contract that 
included a major concession to do away with the closed shop that currently 
forces all employees represented by the guild, whether members or not, to pay 
dues. The announced strike deadline had been 12:01 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, negotiators for the guild, which represents about 1,150 reporters, 
photographers and advertising, circulation and other employees, have said a 
walkout could come at any time. 
</P>
<P>
"The most effective strike in the newspaper business is a surprise strike," 
said Craig Rose, a Union reporter and a member of the guild's strike steering 
committee. "We want to have an effective strike." 
</P>
<P>
Late Sunday, an answering machine at strike headquarters played this taped 
message: 
</P>
<P>
"A meeting was held today to make preparations for a possible strike which we 
could call at any time. We've appreciated all of your support so far. We want 
people to continue to get ready. Wear your running shoes next week. Take your 
strike gear with you to the office. We are getting ready. . . . Keep the 
faith."

WOMAN JUST BOOKED INTO JAIL DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 25-year-old San Diego woman died at an El Cajon hospital early Sunday after 
she was found unconscious Saturday at the County Jail at Las Colinas. 
</P>
<P>
Cynthia Denise Floyd of the 300 block of South Melrae had been arrested at her 
apartment at 9 a.m. Saturday on misdemeanor warrants, San Diego Police Sgt. 
Chuck Curtis said. She was booked at the women's jail in Santee and was 
scheduled to be released on her own recognizance, Curtis said. 
</P>
<P>
Paramedics were called about 7:40 p.m. after Floyd was found lying on the floor 
of the jail's release room, where she had been sleeping. Police said she was 
taken to the AMI Valley Medical Center hospital in El Cajon and died there at 
5:19 a.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
An autopsy will be done to determine the cause of death.

FOOTNOTES: PROOF THAT IMAGE IS FLEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those of you who get severe stomach cramps when a shiny Jaguar, Porsche or 
Mercedes-Benz pulls up next to your beat-up old Ford, don't fret. Many of those 
drivers don't own those sexy and speedy cars; they just rent them for a day. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Kerzner, president and chief of operations for Budget Rent-a-Car of Beverly 
Hills, said thousands of people, including celebrities, Japanese businessmen, 
tourists and those who choose to test-drive before they buy, rent the exotic 
and luxurious cars. Budget also rents car phones and life's newest essential: 
the car fax machine. 
</P>
<P>
He said customers, age 25 and up, rent the cars for business and personal 
reasons. Some simply do it for show. 
</P>
<P>
Customers are "screaming" for the Mazda Miata and the new Toyota Lexus right 
now, Kerzner said. 
</P>
<P>
"People in Southern California have a love for automobiles. Without a car in 
Southern California, you can't get around. 
</P>
<P>
"Your car is your image." 
</P>

Wannabes -- those who want to sit behind a Porsche and the like -- can expect 
to pay $29.95 a day for the Mitsubishi Mirage and $1,000 a day for the Ferrari 
Testarossa.

Not in Gear With Michael 
</P>
<P>
Where do you go after you land Michael Jackson as a pitchman? 
</P>
<P>
Well, for athletic shoe company L.A. Gear, it's gone a long way down the 
celebrity ladder. Since Jackson signed on with L.A. Gear in the fall, the 
Marina del Rey company has named a host of celebrity endorsers -- but none seem 
to be in Jackson's league. Among the additional celebrity pitchmen are 
basketball stars Akeem Olajuwon and Karl Malone and model Heather Locklear. 
Last week, L.A. Gear also announced that it had signed actress Priscilla 
Presley to target what it calls the "30-plus" woman. 
</P>
<P>
For those awaiting the Jackson commercials, don't hold your breath. They are 
not expected to air until next spring. 
</P>
<P>
If You Really Loved Us . . . 
</P>
<P>
If all else fails, ask your customers to help you sell your product. That's 
what Investor's Daily, the Los Angeles-based publication that dubs itself 
"America's Business Newspaper," is doing. 
</P>
<P>
A computerized letter sent to subscribers from Investor's Daily founder and 
Chairman William J. O'Neil begins with the plea: "You are very important to 
Investor's Daily, and I'd like to ask you for a little help." 
</P>
<P>
O'Neil asks the reader to submit the names, addresses and phone numbers of 
"friends, relatives, investors or business associates" who might be worthy 
candidates for Investor's Daily subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
But don't worry, Investor's Daily will do the rest, sending each nominee a free 
two-week subscription with the compliments of the subscriber who submitted 
their name. 
</P>
<P>
Although Investor's Daily, with a circulation of 101,000, is "growing rapidly," 
the letter says, the help is needed so that the newspaper can double its 
circulation and compete with the Wall Street Journal. Now what subscriber could 
ignore such a heartfelt entreaty?

Tammy's Tale: A sometimes sobbing Tammy Faye Bakker told a Lakeland, Fla., 
church congregation of her life without Jim and how she's hired an appeals 
lawyer to get her husband out of prison. "Our lawyer felt we have a 77% chance, 
praise the Lord," Mrs. Bakker said to thunderous applause at the Carpenter's 
Home Church. Bakker is in a Rochester, Minn., federal prison serving a 45-year 
sentence for defrauding investors of the PTL Ministry, which he founded. Bakker 
defended her husband, saying he is incapable of defrauding anybody. "Jim walks 
in his own steps," she said. "He doesn't walk in the judge's steps. He doesn't 
walk in the government's steps. Who are we to say his steps were not supposed 
to walk through prison?" 
</P>
<P>
Italian Stallion: A magistrate in Milan, Italy, has ordered the husband of 
Princess Caroline of Monaco to stand trial on charges of avoiding military 
service. Stefano Casiraghi, 29, got a military reprieve in 1983 when he showed 
a medical certificate stating he had a genital tumor which could cause 
impotence. In 1986, new medical tests showed no traces of the tumor. By that 
time he had fathered two children.

D.C. Ditty: The satirical singing group the Capitol Steps seemed on top of 
things back in July when it composed the parody "We Need a Little Isthmus" to 
the tune of "We Need a Little Christmas." In the song, a George Bush type sings 
that he is bored with puppies and horseshoes. His Army troops respond, "George, 
you need a little isthmus/Right this very minute/Give Manuel the Business/If 
you now begin it/We could all be home by Christmas/We might even win it." And 
"Bush" says, "Kick Manuel right in the fanny/Send a force that's led by Danny."

PERSPECTIVES ON THE 'DIVORCE WARS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As an investment consultant who counsels women daily on a wide range of 
financial matters, I was dismayed to note that your article on Los Angeles' 
acrimonious "divorce wars" ("Nasty, Nasty, Nasty," Dec. 8) failed to challenge 
-- indeed, reinforced -- a chronic misconception regarding women and money and 
marriage. 
</P>
<P>
In point of fact, marriage is an economic partnership. Thus, there is no such 
thing as "his" money or "her" money, only "theirs," a distinction which 
evidently escaped your writer, who persisted in such phrases as "Spielberg . . 
. gave (Amy) Irving" x-number of dollars, and Norman Lear "handed wife Frances. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
The clear -- and misleading -- implication here is that the money belonged to 
the men and was theirs to give or withhold at will, an idea stemming from the 
notion that handling money is a man's job and therefore rightfully the sole 
province of the husband. 
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding the tremendous strides made during the last few decades, 
society seems still to be saddled with certain myths that stand in the way of 
women's taking responsibility for their financial well being. With more and 
more women bearing more and more responsibility for the financial security of 
themselves and their families, can't we please agree that money is everyone's 
business and move into the '90s with a renewed spirit of reason and equality?

WOMEN'S MOVEMENT: TIME'S BAD TIMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nikki Finke's article on the women's movement ("Time Picks on Feminism," Nov. 
30) was right on target when it pointed to Time magazine's failure to define 
feminism. Feminism never has been the one-dimensional white, middle-class 
struggle the media persist in presenting. 
</P>
<P>
It is the fight for basic human rights for all women -- more than half the 
world's population. It is integral to the fight against racism, anti-gay 
bigotry, child abuse, poverty, dismal health care and much more. This is why 
feminism is simultaneously trivialized and fiercely resisted. 
</P>
<P>
The murderous rampage in Canada that left 14 women dead and ongoing right-wing 
terror at abortion clinics are riveting examples of the life-and-death struggle 
that the women's movement truly embodies. 
</P>
<P>
The heart and ferocity of feminism comes from poor and working women, 
especially women of color. From hospital and cannery workers and teachers 
waging militant labor strikes to the student who writes editorials in her high 
school newspaper condemning sexual harassment, the message is clear: Women will 
not retreat. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third Wave of Feminism: A Candidly Revolutionary Approach" is the timely 
theme of the upcoming 23rd Anniversary Conference of Radical Women, a socialist 
feminist organization. It is expected to draw hundreds of feminists, radicals, 
community activists and students from across the country and abroad. Scheduled 
for Feb. 17-20 in Santa Monica, this national conference will focus on the 
theory and strategies needed for making the third wave of feminism a winning 
one.

TASTY TALES THAT GROW DIZZYING AFTER A WHILE

<TEXT>
<P>
Escapes by Joy Williams (Atlantic Monthly Press: $18.95; 180 pages). 
</P>
<P>
By the luck of the draw for this critic, short-story collections have been 
pouring in, so that in the space of a week, like a drunk on a binge, I've gone 
through six of them: stories about the homeless, stories "from the rest of the 
world," stories by Carol Emshwiller, Susan Dodd and perhaps the current 
reigning queen of this form, Joy Williams. 
</P>
<P>
At some level, it's a little like drinking 27 whiskey sours, or eating 18 bags 
of chocolate bit cookies. The short stories are the refuge of heightened 
sensitivities, the apercu in spades; the tragic random incidents, the 
gratuitous fortune. The short story also searches for, and sometimes finds, the 
quick-fix shortcut to enlightenment. 
</P>
<P>
But there are only so many misfortunes in this world, only so many apercus, 
unfortunately, and our metaphors for magic moments are cruelly limited. Thus, 
when you read the title story here, "Escapes," in which a girl on the edge of 
adulthood ponders the performance of a provincial magician and understands 
there are some things magic can't fix, it's not Joy Williams' fault that right 
next door to her on the short-story shelf, Mary Bush has written a vignette in 
which a girl on the edge of adulthood ponders the performance of a provincial 
magician -- and so on. 
</P>
<P>
When Williams writes a story about "The Blue Men," in which the controlling 
metaphor is the Taureg, that splendid set of nomadic North Africans where the 
men go veiled and the women reveal their forearms when they want to insult 
someone -- those gaudy, unregenerate Taureg who live by their wits in the 
impenetrable desert! -- it isn't Williams' fault that, in this same month, 
Ibrahim Al-Kouni has used the Taureg for that same purpose in one of his 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
And when Joy Williams uses crib death or the death of a child to cut to the 
tragedy in a page or two, it's not her fault if the death of a child in the 
short story world this season is as prevalent as the common cold in the real 
world. 
</P>
<P>
Williams' strength is in her purity of writing, her elegant melancholia. 
There's a lot of elegant agony, Joan Didion agony, in these stories: "At the 
bottom of the bank, a flat stream moved laboriously around fine covered trees. 
The mud glistened in the sun. Blackberries grew in the brush. This place had a 
lot of candor, Gloria thought." Gloria is picnicking with a woman she doesn't 
like, but that isn't the half of it. She also has an inoperable brain tumor, 
and she's only in her 30s. 
</P>
<P>
Later, in another story, another woman rests in "a simple and pleasant" room. 
"It seemed to Joan the kind of room in which someone was supposed to be getting 
better." Joan's problem? Two children lost to crib death, but who's counting? 
</P>
<P>
Every once in a while, Williams gets funny. Parts of "Gurdjieff in the Sunshine 
State" are funny. Not witty, but funny, as if a movie queen were to break 
unexpectedly through her icy beauty and tell a bawdy joke. "Lu-lu," the story 
of an elderly couple, a lonely woman and a snake with a bad personality, is 
very funny. But when you look to see if Williams will let herself be funny 
again, she's already back to elegant melancholia. 
</P>
<P>
These stories seem retro, as if the author is saying that the human condition 
is hopeless and our only weapons with which to address this condition are 
insight, intelligence, misery and style. 
</P>
<P>
The short-story form is not a place where characters have room to act, to move, 
to fight. They can only register what happens, take it on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
Williams is a gorgeous writer and a master of the short story. And reading 
these short stories is wonderful, just like drinking whiskey sours at sunset, 
except that after the sixth one, you begin to feel dizzy and ill. You long for 
some fresh air. Or a heroic act. Some Alka Seltzer, or a helicopter rescue.

CHRONICLING THE FOUR-LETTER WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLEL SCHWARTZ, Schwartz's Century's End: A Cultural History of the Fin de 
Siecle From the 990s through the 1990's will be published by Doubleday in 
January. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Wartime: Understanding and Behavior in the Second World War (Oxford University 
Press: $19.95; 330 pages, illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
As the networks keep reminding us, World War II began 50 years ago, and Paul 
Fussell has something to say about our cultural memories of that war: We still 
haven't got it right. We are celebrating the 50 years as if they constituted a 
jubilee. If ever there were a war that deserved to be fought, declaims one 
commentator after another, the war that began in the fall of 1939 was it. The 
Good War. The Just War. 
</P>
<P>
Fussell, professor of English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, is 
the author of a seminal work about World War I. In "The Great War and Modern 
Memory," he argued that the "civilized" European nations had no effective 
traditions to fall back on when confronted with the mustard gas, the 
shellshock, the trench warfare and the deadly attrition of those five years, 
1914-18. The Great War became therefore a myth-historical watershed, at once 
the source and the center of what is modern about modern life: self-doubt, 
philosophical fragmentation, biographical discontinuity, perpetual irony, the 
loss of heroic prospects. 
</P>
<P>
What then of the next war, which demoted the Great to the First? Like many a 
second child hardly as confident, boastful or dashing as the elder, World War 
II assumed to itself not glory but goodness, not brilliance but technical 
skill, not moral suasion but high-mindedness. The Allies entered the war, as 
Fussell shows in his new book, with displays of light armor and daydreams of 
"finesse, accuracy, and subtlety." They began with the conviction, for example, 
that through precision sighting, bombs could tell enemy soldiers from 
civilians, munition depots from milk depots, the guilty from the pure of heart. 
</P>
<P>
But war is obscene, insists Fussell, who led infantry troops into combat at age 
20 in 1944, and World War II was as obscene as it was "long, bloody, brutal, 
total and stupid." More civilian men, women and children were killed between 
1939 and 1945 than were soldiers, sailors and airmen. If four-letter words, 
uncivil, indecent, remain unprintable, then, as Walt Whitman said of an earlier 
and equally obscene conflict, "The real war will never get in the books." Until 
we make our way past the fictions of its higher purpose to the facts of men 
befouling themselves, maiming, being maimed, we can have no grip on the 
experience of World War II, in and of itself a four-letter word. Until we 
attend to the carnage that scared soldiers witless and the explosions that 
shook them inside out, we cannot come to terms with the war. "America has not 
yet understood what World War II was like and thus has been unable to use such 
understanding to re-interpret and redefine the national reality and to arrive 
at something like public maturity." 
</P>
<P>
So Fussell takes us on something of a Devil's Dictionary tour of World War II, 
from light infantry blown to bits by massive German tanks to "precision 
bombing" that wreaked more havoc upon friends than foes; from constant military 
blunders to persistent stories of cannibalism and corruption, of enemy agents 
disguised as nuns and the unknowing rumor circulated by Allied 
counterintelligence of a "terrible catastrophe that would befall Japan during 
the first week of August," 1945. In battle, young men discovered that neither 
craft nor caution nor black humor nor counterintelligence could redeem them. 
Fitness, foresight, courage -- these too had nothing to do with survival. 
Living was merely a matter of luck. British soldiers upon waking made sure that 
their first spoken word was "rabbits." Servicemen everywhere carried St. 
Christopher medallions or talisman brassieres. Eisenhower rubbed a lucky set of 
seven coins before each campaign. 
</P>
<P>
For the "common man" whose fanfare Aaron Copland composed in 1943, wartime was 
less about winning than about getting through and making it back home 
recognizably human. Fussell chronicles the interminable waiting that drove men 
up walls, the emotional and psychic casualties of the war on the front lines 
and back on the "home fronts." With particular vehemence he describes "the 
petty harassment of the weak by the strong" that had nothing to do with 
winning, everything to do with humiliation. 
</P>
<P>
In the resilient obscenities of the fighting men, not in the bland fiction and 
poetry produced during the war, Fussell discerns that current of modernism that 
he explored in his book about World War I. Tracking the lives of those 
"utilitarian, unchivalric, unheroic" GI Joes whose only recourse was scurrility 
and scatology, Fussell locates the only truly "modernist impulse toward 
subversion and Making New." These modernists used their f-stops as every 
possible part of speech to express an inexpressible contempt or to explain the 
inexplicable hell into which they were sent time and again. 
</P>
<P>
Himself an inveterate word man, Fussell claims to be saying something 
meaningful about World War II that we have not already intuited from film of 
bulldozers shoving fleshless bodies into pits or from photos of the residue of 
the "Fat Man" dropped by the Enola Gay. Yet beyond this condemnation of vacuous 
high-mindedness and his foursquare approach to the "fresh idiom" of Army slang, 
Fussell contributes little to our understanding of behavior during wartime. 
</P>
<P>
He contradicts himself concerning the denial or exploitation of fear, the 
absence or presence of a sense of the ironic, the recourse to words or to 
silence in the midst of the horrors of the war. And his generalizations amount 
to cliches. Wartime rumors "illustrate the principle that a complex human 
motive is more interesting to contemplate than a simple cause"; in the 
widespread typecasting of Germans, Japanese, Italians, "each enemy has taken on 
the characteristics of his primary geography." 
</P>
<P>
Rather a demoniacally entertaining potpourri than a coherent, profound account 
of World War II experiences, "Wartime" is ultimately less moving than Studs 
Terkel's oral history of " 'The Good War,' " or Archie Sattefield's oral 
history of "The Home Front," neither of which slips so quickly past the Jewish 
experience of World War II as both the holiest and unholiest of conflicts, the 
bitter experiences of the million American blacks in uniform, the hard lives of 
women during the war. Fussell's book is primarily an excursus upon a white 
Christian male Anglo-American wartime, and despite his apparent exaltation of 
the creatively vile-mouthed "common man," the figures dominating the index are 
Winston Churchill, Evelyn Waugh, Adolf Hitler, British dandy Julian 
Maclaren-Ross, F.D.R., Eisenhower and T.S. Eliot. 
</P>
<P>
"Wartime" is a book that could have been written only in the aftermath of 
Vietnam, and it is not by chance that Fussell's best chapter concerns "The 
Ideological Vacuum" into which art and literature fell during World War II. Nor 
is it by chance that Fussell's most original point concerns the absence of 
images of dismemberment in all pictorials of World War II combat. "Wartime" is 
essentially an afterthought conditioned by the images we now have of a war 
without glory. Like good graffiti, the book will shock some people,will linger 
for a time on walls and shelves, then fade beneath other, bolder strokes.

WARMING: CENTURY'S HOTTEST TOPIC

Global Warming: Are We Entering the Greenhouse Century? by Stephen H. Schneider 
(Sierra Club Books: $18.95; 336 pages; illustrated). 
</P>
<P>
If you are in the natural sciences, "global climate change" is just about the 
most exciting jingle -- and perhaps the hottest meal ticket -- to hit the 
catch-phrase circuit since "survival of the fittest." 
</P>
<P>
And well it should be. For once, a distinct majority of climatologists are in 
agreement about the weather prediction: It is -- as you well know unless you 
have been off the planet the last couple of years -- a warming trend. A rather 
quick one, with no end in sight. And with consequences for humanity and the 
remainder of the Earth's fellow travelers that threaten to be rather 
interesting. 
</P>
<P>
If I were forced to select but one chronicler for this new adventure we are 
undertaking, it would be Stephen Schneider. For a scientist he is too glib; for 
a journalist he is too technical. He has a leg firmly insinuated into each camp 
-- and that's no pedestrian accomplishment. 
</P>
<P>
Schneider is head of "Interdisciplinary Climate Systems" at the National Center 
for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo., a National Science 
Foundation-sponsored institution that has consistently been at the cutting edge 
of research and policy. 
</P>
<P>
A few years back, Schneider co-authored a book -- also published by the Sierra 
Club -- entitled "The Co-Evolution of Climate and Life" that offered a 
thrilling reconstruction of the Earth's past climates and the newly emerging 
science of global future climate modeling for those sufficiently brave to 
tackle a little chemistry and some complex graphs. Schneider wasn't afraid to 
say to his non-scientific readers, "Come on, work a little and I'll make it 
worth your while." And he was right. For serious fans of weather who have 
graduated from cumulus and occluded front, it's the best thing in print. 
</P>
<P>
The modest-appearing predicted increases of 3 to 5 degrees (Celsius) over the 
next century would be unprecedented in human history. The average increases 
obscure the way we will perceive climatic change: more heat waves, more 
droughts, more floods, more extreme weather. 
</P>
<P>
Today, scientific, public and -- belatedly -- governmental concern about the 
nature and consequences of "the greenhouse effect" is beginning to drive myriad 
research programs: If you are a climatologist, you are examining polar ice 
cores for evidence of past climates and the gas concentrations that accompanied 
them. You are using supercomputers to run increasingly complex models of ocean 
and atmospheric circulation and evaporation/condensation cycles that attempt to 
factor in changes in the Earth's potential for retaining the sun's heat. And 
you are looking at other anthropogenic greenhouse gases -- CFCs, ozone, oxides 
of nitrogen -- to try to figure how these may contribute to the equation in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
If you are an agricultural scientist, you may well be using the first uncertain 
maps predicting temperature zones and precipitation to estimate changes in the 
kinds of crops and their production that will take place in each region. 
Meanwhile, foresters are conducting parallel exercises for timber. 
</P>
<P>
If you are an ecologist, you are predicting the distribution of future natural 
plant communities, perhaps borrowing data that paleontologists are extracting 
from fossil pollen in lake bottoms on the kinds of vegetation that accompanied 
past climates, and how fast it could migrate with climatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Plant physiologists are attempting to calculate what stimulating effect 
increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide may have on plant growth, and the degree 
to which increased growth could then transfer carbon from the atmosphere to 
plant tissue reservoirs -- a negative-feedback or homeostatic loop. 
</P>
<P>
Conservation biologists, meanwhile, remind their colleagues that the biggest 
such carbon pool lies in the tropical rain forests, which are rapidly being 
converted back to CO2 (carbon dioxide) themselves, and wonder what the 
extinction price of global warming may be as thousands or millions of species 
discover their habitats are becoming less habitable and there is no place left 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanographers ponder what dimensions the oceans will assume as they expand 
with increasing temperature, and what additional volume may be added by melting 
polar ice caps. On the other hand, the enormous mass of the world's oceans may 
well absorb some of the greenhouse gases, and may act as a thermal ballast to 
slow atmospheric warming. 
</P>
<P>
Regional planners in some places are contemplating the redistribution of 
available water through changes in precipitation patterns, while those in 
places like San Francisco, New York, Calcutta, Holland or Indonesia nervously 
study the oceanographers' estimates of sea-level rise. 
</P>
<P>
The economists, of course, are beginning to add all of the potential costs and 
benefits together for each regional and national economy. And they are likewise 
starting to weigh the costs of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which come 
mostly from the burning of coal, oil and wood, against the burden of global 
climate change. Sociologists wonder what these changes portend for people's 
lives, and the political scientists ponder future conflicts arising from 
economic or social dislocations. 
</P>
<P>
That's a taste of "Global Warming." Schneider is not certain of the greenhouse 
effect, but he's sufficiently convinced -- he provides the evidence that 
convinces him -- that he argues forcefully for investing in more research and 
better planning. And he is less than kindly toward bureaucrats and politicians 
who resisted such efforts during much of the past Administration. 
</P>
<P>
There are plenty of puzzles he leaves unresolved. For example, there is an 
excellent correlation in climatic record between past temperatures and levels 
of methane and carbon dioxide, but there are also mechanisms by which these 
gases could have been the product, rather than the cause, of higher 
temperatures. We are almost certainly in between periods of glacial advance and 
retreat. There is a link between global activity, but Schneider does not fully 
explain this as he summarizes the most popular theories of "intrinsic" 
(Earth-bound) and "extrinsic" (solar or orbital fluctuations) forcing of 
climatic change. 
</P>
<P>
Granted, this is an exceedingly complex-albeit fasinating-topic. The hottest 
years of the century have occurred in the 1980s. Are they the beginnings of the 
greenhouse or some other climatic process? 
</P>
<P>
Schneider tantalizes, but remembers his scientific credentials. He does observe 
that the best available analyses of global records dating back many decades do 
show a regular rise in temperature, but at only half the rate predicted by 
levels of the greenhouse gases. Does this invalidate the model? 
</P>
<P>
There is more. A little backpatting history of research and politics provides 
levening. A modest chapter suggests how we may mitigate and cope with the 
greenhouse century-chiefly by becoming more energy-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
And there are good footnotes and a good index. This is a complex book, but 
because Schneider clearly has the gift of gab and a touch of the prophet, it 
works and works well.

HOLLOW PREDICTIONS ABOUT AMERICA

American Renaissance: Our Life at the Turn of the 21st Century by Marvin Cetron 
and Owen Davis (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 320 pages). 
</P>
<P>
There are 55 stars on the flag on the cover of "American Renaissance: Our Life 
at the Turn of the 21st Century" by "futurologists" Marvin Cetron and Owen 
Davis. One of the extra stars stands for Puerto Rico, and the other four stand 
for Canada which -- so Cetron and Davis fatuously but confidently assert -- 
will join the United States sometime near the dawn of the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
Why Canada "minus Quebec, which will become, we are told, independent" will 
join as four states rather than two, six, eight or 12, or why it will join at 
all, our authors never tell us. They live in a happy land above the clouds 
where such mundane questions are not raised; where the laws of history, logic 
and arithmetic do not hold; where America's most pressing problems will 
disappear in a decade -- and where bad prose, sloppy editing and wishful 
thinking add up to a book. 
</P>
<P>
"Futurology" is a discipline -- we do not say a science -- concerned with 
making predictions -- in this case about the year 2000. The discipline lends 
itself to two kinds of predictions: the obvious and the venturesome. The 
obvious predictions are the most common, although not always the safest. One 
simply extrapolates a given trend into the future and -- presto! -- the 
predictions appear. Thus Cetron and Davis can tell us that there will be more 
old people in the year 2000 than there are now. There will be more need for 
nursing homes, a shortage of qualified workers to staff them, and greater 
trouble paying the health-care bills of the elderly. In perhaps the most 
competent of the 22 chapters of this book, the authors look at additional 
implications of demographic changes now under way in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
This kind of trend-spotting is the lower futurology, and our authors have 
higher aspirations. At their most interesting, futurologists apply the 
principles of history, economics, sociology and technology to imagine possible 
futures that can help guide our actions in the present. "Predictions" of this 
kind rarely are fully justified by events, but often contain insights of great 
importance and interest. 
</P>
<P>
This is the level of futurology to which Cetron and Davis aspire, and this is 
the level at which they fail -- painfully, publicly, utterly. They want to make 
the case for America's coming recovery from its troubles of the last two 
decades, but their understanding of the problems is so clearly superficial that 
their optimism rings hollow. Unintentionally, they have written a book from 
which only pessimists and cynics can take solace. 
</P>
<P>
Take economic competitiveness, for example. Many observers have been troubled 
by the difficulties American industry has had in coping with international 
competition. Clearly, if such difficulties continue, it will be difficult to 
finance a rising standard of living for American workers. This development 
would be bad news not only for them but for all those who make their living 
selling workers cars and consumer goods, tending their illnesses and building 
them houses. Cetron and Davis acknowledge the problem, but make a diagnosis 
that economists of every school would consider foolish, and predict a cure 
based solely on wishful thinking. 
</P>
<P>
Their "diagnosis" begins with the colossally silly statement that "each nation 
that makes a place for itself in international commerce reduces the market for 
American goods and so cuts into our standard of living." The Smith family might 
as well say that every dollar the Joneses make is one less dollar for the 
Smiths. Actually, of course, the prosperity of the Joneses is good news for the 
Smiths, and the growth of other countries is good for the United States. In 
both cases, the greater incomes of our trading partners mean more opportunities 
for us to sell goods to them. Prosperity is contagious -- that is why American 
administrations, liberal and conservative, Republican and Democratic, have 
tried to increase international trade for the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
So far, so bad. But when "American Renaissance" ventures into the field of 
international relations, it gets even further out of its depth. Japan "may soon 
collapse," say the authors in a one-page mini-essay stuffed with embarrassing 
mistakes. Why is Japan in decline? Declining competitiveness with East Asia 
(actually, Japan maintains healthy trade surpluses with most of the newly 
emergent countries), rising unemployment at 4% (actually, Japanese unemployment 
is at 2.2%, down from 2.4% in the last year) and slowing gross national product 
(actually, Japan's growth at 4.8% in the last 12 months remains the highest, by 
far, of any major industrial nation). "American Renaissance" also points to the 
graying of Japan as a source of weakness, but fails to mention that unlike the 
United States, Japan is a net international creditor with approximately $10 
trillion in total savings to support its retirees. 
</P>
<P>
According to "American Renaissance," at or near the turn of the century, Japan 
will decline, Canada will join the union, and the Soviet Union will cooperate 
with the United States to police the developing world. Maybe -- but Cetron and 
Davis' error-filled and superficial analysis fails to persuade. 
</P>
<P>
A strong case can be made that America's decline is not anywhere near 
irreversible, and that a new and better world is just around the corner. 
Unfortunately, this book doesn't make that case. Badly conceived and poorly 
organized, it is -- or ought to be -- an embarrassment to its publisher, its 
editor, its authors and their fellow futurologists and optimists everywhere.

AIDS Discrimination Case Reversed on Appeal: A state appeals court has ruled 
that a West Hollywood nail salon violated the city's anti-discrimination law by 
refusing to give a pedicure to a person with AIDS, the man's attorney said 
Thursday. The case, decided by a panel from the 2nd District Court of Appeal, 
was the first court test of the West Hollywood ordinance, which prohibits 
discrimination by businesses against persons with AIDS, said lawyer Gloria 
Allred, who represented the patient. Paul Jasperson, who filed the suit after 
being denied a pedicure at Jessica's Nail Salon in 1986, died in May of AIDS. 
In its decision, issued Wednesday, the 2nd District Court of Appeals ruled 
2-to-1 that the West Hollywood ordinance should apply to the Sunset Boulevard 
salon. The third justice, Jack Goertzen, dissented, saying the case should have 
been dismissed because Jasperson had died. The attorney for Jessica's Nail 
Salon was not immediately available for comment. (Filed Jan. 13, 1987, Case 
Nos. WEC109666, B035646.)

Copyright Suit Filed Over Hip Replacement: Zimmer Inc., a Warsaw, Ind., 
company, filed a patent infringement suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles 
against Techmedica of Calabasas Tuesday, charging that the company copied its

claims are based on its patented design. Clyde Pratt, president of Techmedica 
said, "We have reviewed their patent and feel that their claim is baseless."

Class-Action Suit Filed Against Columbia Savings: A shareholder class-action 
suit was filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles Wednesday against Columbia 
Savings &amp; Loan Assn., charging that the Beverly Hills thrift delayed 
reporting its losses in the junk bond market to keep its stock price 
artificially inflated. Columbia lied to its shareholders by reporting a profit 
in the second quarter of 1989 to benefit the Spiegel family, owners of 70% of 
the company's stock, the suit said. The thrift owns $3.8 billion in junk bonds, 
the largest portfolio of junk bonds held by any S&amp;L in the country. The 
suit was filed in the name of Violet Klein, who bought 2,000 shares of Columbia 
on Sept. 15, 1989. The suit seeks to represent those who held shares of 
Columbia's common stock between Aug. 9, 1989, and Oct. 25, 1989. Columbia 
Savings officials had no comment. (Filed Dec. 20, 1989, Case No. CV89-7327.)

MARKET BEAT: A FEW GEMS MAY STILL BE ON THE TAKEOVER LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERB GREENBERG, HERB GREENBERG is a financial columnist for the San 
Francisco Chronicle. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Don't be surprised if the few mass-market jewelry retailers that haven't been 
acquired wind up getting bought now that Ratners Group PLC has bought 
Seattle-based Weisfield's. Charles LaLoggia, who publishes Special Situations 
Report in Rochester, N.Y., puts jewelry chain acquisitions at the top of his 
takeover list. 
</P>
<P>
The most likely targets, he says, are the 225-store Duarte-based Barry's 
Jewelers chain and Reeds Jewelers, a 67-store chain based in Wilmington, N.C. 
The third and largest of the publicly owned mass-market jewelry chains, Kay 
Jewelers of Alexandria, Va., with 488 stores, also is vulnerable, LaLoggia 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"My bet is that within the next 12 to 24 months, none of these companies will 
be public," he said. But in the near term, he bets that Kay is more likely to 
be an acquirer, since it was believed to be ready to launch a bid for 
Weisfield's before Ratners moved in. If Kay does go shopping, LaLoggia's guess 
is that it will go after Reeds, whose size is most similar to Weisfield's. 
</P>
<P>
Insiders and officers of Reeds control 84% of its stock, and the company hasn't 
indicated a desire to be sold. On the other hand, analyst Sarah Stack of 
Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards says she believes that closely held Barry's is 
receptive to a takeover and could fetch upward of $20 an share, or about twice 
its current NASDAQ price. 
</P>
<P>
And Kay? Based on what Ratners is paying for Weisfield's, LaLoggia pegs it at 
$35. The stock closed Friday on the New York Stock Exchange at $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
Queasy About Drug Stocks 
</P>
<P>
Drug stocks historically have been low risk. Not only do sick people need drugs 
in good economic times and bad, but profit growth has been sustained by 
longstanding patents. 
</P>
<P>
But Morgan Stanley analyst Paul Brooke told me that he's advising clients to 
start thinking about getting out of certain major drug companies that will lose 
the "annuity feature" that comes with patents. In 1992 and 1993, he cautions, 
patent coverage for a variety of major products will expire, and the 
sustainable growth rate of some companies "will be materially changed." That 
would ultimately translate to lower stock prices. Brooke's concern is that many 
investors aren't thinking that far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
The so-called ethical drug firms that sell directly to doctors -- such as 
Syntex, Upjohn and Marion -- could be hurt the most, Brooke says. On the other 
hand, proprietary companies whose products are sold directly to consumers -- 
such as Schering-Plough, Warner-Lambert and Bristol-Myers Squibb -- offer 
strong prospects. So do companies with what Brooke calls "unappreciated 
technology bases," such as Medtronic (heart pacemakers), Acuson (ultrasound) 
and Eli Lilly, whose products cover all bases. 
</P>
<P>
Short Selling First Executive 
</P>
<P>
Two of this country's smartest investors -- the Templeton group of funds and 
Fidelity Investments -- are big holders of First Executive Corp., a 
controversial Los Angeles life insurer whose stock has plunged 40% in the past 
two months. But the stock is also a target of some very smart short sellers. 
They are believed to include some folks who were aggressively shorting 
high-flying Integrated Resources before its recent financial troubles surfaced 
and Baldwin-United before it collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The shorts are betting on the demise of First Exec in part because of its junk 
bond portfolio. What's puzzling is how smart people on both sides can have such 
strong and differing convictions and how the shorts can bet against such 
heavyweights as Templeton and Fidelity. As one veteran short seller pointed 
out, though, Templeton and Fidelity also held big stakes in Integrated 
Resources. 
</P>
<P>
A Difference of Opinion 
</P>
<P>
From the fair-and-equal-treatment department: A spokeswoman for Businessland 
(who had been dodging my queries) called to dispute last week's item that Apple 
Computer had rescinded a 3% discount that it had supposedly granted to 
Businessland. But she declined to explain why it was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem is that I can't comment on details of our business arrangement," 
she said. "However, it certainly was inaccurate. We have a good relationship 
with them, and nothing has changed." 
</P>
<P>
Palo Alto consultant Seymour Merrin, who first told me the story, sticks by it.

PAUL ECKE'S POINSETTIAS HAD THEIR ROOTS IN HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRUCE KEPPEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Older Angelenos may recall the days when, at this time of year, the fields 
around Hollywood were ablaze with poinsettias growing in the open. The sight of 
the red flowers drew busloads of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ecke, who began cultivating the plants in Hollywood in 1906, sold his crop 
as cut flowers in stands along Sunset Boulevard. But by 1924 the land had 
become too valuable to support further farming, and Ecke moved the operation to 
San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Paul Ecke Poinsettia Ranch in Encinitas covers hundreds of acres 
near Interstate 5 and Encinitas Boulevard. The payroll climbs to seasonal highs 
of about 300 -- not just at the holiday season but also at midyear, when the 
emphasis is on producing seedlings for other commercial growers in the West and 
in 65 countries around the world. 
</P>
<P>
There still are fields of flowers. But a lot of the production today takes 
place within the greenhouses that cover 35 acres, said spokeswoman Carolyn 
Mack. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the main business, besides supplying cuttings from "mother plants" to 
other growers, is to develop new poinsettia cultivars, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Every year we produce about 10,000 new and different seedlings. These are 
evaluated, and several dozen are selected for further trials and 
cross-breeding. It can take a dozen years to produce one new commercial 
variety, like this year's bright yellow poinsettia, which we call 'lemon drop,' 
" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Paul Ecke Sr., now 95, is in good health and maintains an active interest in 
the ranch. "He comes to work every day and checks the greenhouses," Mack said.

Eastern Cutting More Flights: Eastern Airlines, which just sold its Latin 
American routes, announced that it is also reducing some domestic flights. In 
the first announced reduction of its flight schedule since Eastern began 
rebuilding from a crippling strike, the carrier said it will reduce daily 
flights to 803 from 830 on Jan. 31. That will reduce Eastern's departures from 
its Miami home base to 51 from 78. In a message to employees, Eastern said: 
"Some furloughs may be necessary as we reduce operations."

FED DECIDED ON STEADY COURSE AT FALL MEETING; 
</P>
<P>
MONEY: MINUTES OF THE NOV. 14 MEETING SHOW THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE LEFT OPEN 
THE POSSIBILITY OF LOWER INTEREST RATES IF THE ECONOMY WORSENED. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Federal Reserve policy-makers decided not to change monetary policy at their 
late fall meeting but left open the possibility of lower interest rates if 
economic events dictated, according to minutes released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"While current indicators of economic activity suggested a somewhat weaker 
expansion, most of the members agreed that a steady policy course was desirable 
at this point, especially in light of the stimulus provided by recent easing 
actions," said the minutes of the Nov. 14 meeting of the Federal Open Market 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the policy-makers agreed, however, that "some further easing might be 
needed if the incoming information on business activity suggested more 
softening than most members currently expected." 
</P>
<P>
The Fed permitted short-term interest rates to drop a quarter of a percentage 
point last week to 8.25%. It was the first decrease since Nov. 7, when the 
central bank also permitted the federal funds rate to decline a quarter of a 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
Manipulation of this rate, the interest rate that banks charge each other for 
overnight loans, is the primary lever the Fed uses to control short-term 
interest rates. It has used this lever several times since last June, when it 
began relaxing its grip on credit to slow inflation. 
</P>
<P>
The initial decision to keep policy unchanged was reached on a 10-1 vote of the 
open market committee, composed of Fed governors in Washington and five of the 
12 Fed regional bank presidents. 
</P>
<P>
Fed governor Martha Seeger cast the dissenting vote, contending a further 
easing was needed in view of persisting weakness in the manufacturing sector, 
particularly automobiles, and a likely softening in construction and capital 
expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
The committee met again last week, but minutes of that meeting will not be 
released until next month. The committee gathers in secret eight times a year 
to formulate monetary policy and confers by telephone as needed. 
</P>
<P>
In its review of economic conditions last month, it found that the economy 
continued to expand, "though unevenly and at a somewhat slower pace than 
earlier in the year." 
</P>
<P>
"While the service-producing sector appeared to be growing moderately, 
manufacturing had been weak, owing to sluggish demand and to strikes and other 
disruptions to production," the minutes said. "Price increases had been smaller 
since midyear, but there had been no abatement of wage inflation." 
</P>
<P>
Non-farm employment grew appreciably in October, it said, but slower than in 
previous months. 
</P>
<P>
"Widespread job gains were apparent in the service-producing sector, but 
manufacturing payrolls declined further as a result of continued weakness in 
motor vehicles and other durable goods industries," the report said. 
</P>
<P>
The minutes also showed that the Fed staff expected the economy was likely to 
grow at a slower pace.

Movie Company Granted Restraining Order: Delta Unique Media Inc. was granted a 
temporary restraining order Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court to block 
First Cinema Venture Inc. from distributing the company's adult films, 
including "Naughty Nymphs," "The Sinful Bed" and "Sorry, Wrong Bedroom." Judge 
Warren Deering ruled that First Cinema had distributed Delta Unique films 
without the company's permission. The company, operated by a former Delta 
Unique employee, was ordered not to make any more distribution deals for Delta 
Unique films. No attorney for First Cinema appeared at the hearing, and the 
Santa Monica company could not be reached for comment. (Filed Dec. 19, 1989,

Poland has signed an important loan package with the International Monetary 
Fund that will help the East European nation switch to a Western free-market 
style economy. 
</P>
<P>
The deal, reported by the official PAP news agency Saturday, will release a 
$725-million IMF standby loan and trigger other Western aid for Poland's 
near-bankrupt economy. 
</P>
<P>
It will aid the Solidarity-led government, running the country after decades of 
communism, in efforts to move away from a cumbersome, centrally planned 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz and Polish National Bank President 
Wladyslaw Baka signed the letter of intent to the IMF," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
The deal was delayed last Tuesday because the entire Polish cabinet wanted to 
examine its provisions closely before the letter was signed. 
</P>
<P>
The letter sets out a detailed program designed to curb Poland's 500% annual 
inflation and start restructuring its economy along market lines.

Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. has been sued by one of its former vice presidents, 
who alleges that he was fired for refusing to give confidential client 
information to a separate partnership made up of Goldman principals. 
</P>
<P>
Leo Haviland, who previously headed Goldman's Energy Futures &amp; Options 
Group, filed suit in Manhattan federal court last Wednesday alleging Goldman 
violated the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations act. 
</P>
<P>
A Goldman spokesman, who learned of the suit Friday, said: "The complaint is by 
a disgruntled former employee who is unhappy about his termination. It is 
completely without merit." 
</P>
<P>
Haviland said he has been injured in the amount of at least $4 million. 
Haviland traded in energy futures and options on behalf of large refining and 
marketing firms, energy producers and oil trading firms, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
Haviland said Goldman had assured him that he would not have to disclose 
confidential client data to J. Aron, a trading group made up of Goldman 
partners. J. Aron buys and sells futures, options and commodities for itself 
and then hopes to trade them at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
He alleged that Goldman pressured him to reveal the information, but he 
declined.

SAN DIEGO FIRM EARNS MILLIONS FROM KELP TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While Mendocino County's seaweed farmers wrung $73,000 in sales from the ocean 
in 1989, San Diego-based Kelco was harvesting millions of dollars in giant 
kelp. 
</P>
<P>
Kelco, a division of pharmaceuticals giant Merck &amp; Co., is the largest 
company of its kind in the world. It has three 140- to 180-foot ships, kelp 
cutters that mow the tops off the fastest-growing and tallest plants in the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
This seaweed, however, isn't harvested to be eaten. It is used in 70 different 
products, including textiles, cosmetics, dental impression compounds and wound 
packings for hospitals. It also makes for longer-lasting foam in beer. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest application of the algin -- the gelatinous substance extracted from 
kelp -- is in the textile industry's printing paste. The algin thickens the 
paste and provides sharp and well-defined prints. 
</P>
<P>
It is also used to change flow characteristics in such foods as salad dressing, 
to thicken or make them smoother. 
</P>
<P>
Kelco does not reveal annual production or sales figures, but one official said 
the largest annual harvest the 60-year-old company ever made was 170,000 tons 
of seaweed in the 1970s off the California coast. 
</P>
<P>
Its ships trim the surface canopy of giant kelp, usually within a mile of shore 
up and down the coast, from the Mexican border to Monterey, where giant forests 
of the huge plant exist. The kelp forests are leased from the state of 
California. CHARLES HILLINGER

MENDOCINO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Vegetable farmers John Lewallen and his wife, Eleanor, harvest their crops in 
the intertidal waters of the Pacific Ocean at a picturesque, remote cove 
studded with rock outcroppings. 
</P>
<P>
Their briny farm yields wild sea vegetables -- seaweed -- handpicked in 
hard-to-reach coves and bays along a 40-mile stretch of rugged Northern 
California coast. 
</P>
<P>
The small town of Mendocino is the West Coast center of the esoteric sea 
vegetable industry, which supports three little companies whose combined yearly 
sales are less than $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewallens harvest a dozen different species of edible seaweed, which they 
rinse in fresh water, dry on lines in the open air, package and sell through 
the mail and at health food stores across America. 
</P>
<P>
Gross sales for the Lewallens' 9-year-old Mendocino Sea Vegetable Co., operated 
out of their home in nearby Navarro, totaled $36,000 this year, their best on 
record. 
</P>
<P>
The two other companies, Ocean Harvest Sea Vegetable and Rising Tide Sea 
Vegetable Co., have logged gross sales of $30,000 and $7,000, respectively, in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
Sea vegetables sold by the three companies retail for $18 to $24 a pound, $1.80 
to $2.50 for 1-ounce packages. 
</P>
<P>
Connoisseurs prepare the seaweed much as others might serve land-grown 
vegetables: in side dishes, casseroles, omelets, soups, salads and sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
Growing profusely in the bay near Mendocino are fucus, the seaweed known as 
bladderwrack and popular as an herbal tea; grapestone, a seaweed with an 
oyster-like taste and covered with crunchy bumps; sea cabbage; sea lettuce, a 
soggy version of that found in the back-yard garden, and nori, rubbery in the 
wild, the basic ingredient in the popular Japanese soup miso and the seaweed 
wrapper for sushi. 
</P>
<P>
The harvesters are licensed by the state Fish and Game Department. 
</P>
<P>
One recent day, John Lewallen, 47, swam ashore from 100 yards out in the bay, 
where he had cut foot-long fronds from huge onion-shaped bulbs of sea whip 
seaweed bobbing on the surface. 
</P>
<P>
As he boosted himself out of the water and onto a rock covered with fucus, 
50-degree seawater flowed off Lewallen's black wet suit. He lifted a small 
float filled with the sea whip fronds he had harvested. Sea whip is anchored to 
rocks on the ocean floor with 20- to 30-foot long tubular stems. 
</P>
<P>
"The amazing thing about sea whip fronds," Lewallen remarked as he and his wife 
loaded the seaweed into a large plastic bag, "is that the leaves come from a 
monstrous plant, yet (they) are light and delicate in texture and flavor." 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Lewallen talked about the uniqueness of harvesting vegetables from the 
sea. "We don't plant, fertilize or till our crops," she said. "Nature does 
everything. We use no machinery harvesting, and we are very careful when 
trimming the plants to leave the reproductive organs so they continue to 
produce. Our only tools are knives like the one John is using." 
</P>
<P>
As they spoke, John and Eleanor Lewallen and their son, Loren, 5, munched on 
various kinds of seaweed they had plucked off the inshore rocks. Each tasted 
different from the next, yet they shared a common flavor -- something like how 
the ocean smells. 
</P>
<P>
They gathered long, hairy strands of feather boa seaweed and pieces of Turkish 
towel seaweed, both used to rub one's body while taking a bath. "I know some 
people who eat feather boa," John Lewallen said. "I never had a dinner of it 
myself. Even I have to draw the line somewhere," he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
John Lewallen grew up in Alaska and graduated from Whitman College in Walla 
Walla, Wash. He spent a year in India working with villagers and two years with 
an independent Peace Corps-type organization in a Montagnard village in 
Vietnam. For a time he published a counterculture newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
Eleanor Lewallen graduated from Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, 
spent two years at UCLA, earned her English literature degree at UC Berkeley 
and taught for a while. She is widely known as founder of the Ocean Protection 
Coalition and for her appearances at hearings protesting plans for offshore oil 
drilling off the Northern California Coast. 
</P>
<P>
"They call me the 'seaweed lady' because I always bring a bag of sea vegetables 
to the hearings. Our waters off Mendocino County are some of the purest on 
earth, unpolluted, pristine. Oil platforms would pollute the area, kill the sea 
vegetables," she said. 
</P>
<P>
After harvest, the Lewallens tie the seaweed for a day or two on ropes strung 
from trees in their back yard. They place the dried sea vegetables into plastic 
trash bags for storage in an upstairs bedroom of their rustic home to await 
packaging and shipping. 
</P>
<P>
"Seaweed has been a basic food in the Orient for centuries. Japanese, Chinese 
and others have hundreds of uses for it," Lewallen said. "I have tried to 
interest Japanese businessmen to buy wild sea vegetables from our coast. There 
are different varieties here than they have. But so far my efforts have been in 
vain." 
</P>
<P>
The big problem is that in China and Japan, seaweed is cultivated on a large 
scale as well as harvested in the wild and can be produced much more cheaply 
than in California. 
</P>
<P>
The Lewallens dream of helping to combat Mendocino County's high unemployment 
by hiring 75 to 100 sea vegetable harvesters and shipping 5,000 to 20,000 
pounds of seaweed a month to Japan. The current harvest is a mere 1,500 pounds 
of dried seaweed a year. (It weighs 10 times as much when wet.) 
</P>
<P>
But the Japanese businessmen who could make it all happen haven't shown up here 
yet. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Harvest Sea Vegetable Co., in the tiny Mendocino County town of Comptche, 
is owned by Betsy Holliday, 38, a dietary consultant and cooking teacher, and 
Victor Marren, 44, who started harvesting sea vegetables for his own food when 
he lived in Gloucester, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"I came to the Mendocino Coast six years ago for one reason -- sea palm sea 
vegetables," Marren said. "The sea palm grows up to two feet tall and resembles 
miniature palm trees. This seaweed grows only along the coast from Central 
California to British Columbia." 
</P>
<P>
Sea palm fronds, also called sea noodles, are Ocean Harvest's best-selling 
product, retailing at $3.20 per 1.6-ounce package. Holliday and Marren's 
products are found in health food stores as far away as New England and 
Florida. They also publish a seaweed cookbook that sells for $2. 
</P>
<P>
Mendocino Sea Vegetable Co. -- the Lewallens' firm -- also publishes a seaweed 
cookbook, which sells for $4.95 and is in its fourth printing. 
</P>
<P>
Recipes include Wakame Borsch; Nori lettuce and tomato sandwich; dolse (which 
tastes like potato peelings) bagel and cream cheese; sea palm fronds sauteed 
with honey, carrot and rice and also sauteed with butter and garlic, plus 
numerous sea vegetable soups, casseroles and omelets. 
</P>
<P>
"There are 500 to 1,000 different species of sea vegetables," said John 
Lewallen. "We're always experimenting, always looking for new edibles from the 
ocean garden."

NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE LAND OF OZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELDON TEITELBAUM, Los Angeles writer Sheldon Teitelbaum served in Lebanon 
as an Israeli paratroop officer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1982, after his country's invasion of Lebanon, Israeli novelist Amos Oz 
began a personal survey of the psychology of political extremism he sensed 
gaining currency in the Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting book, "In The Land Of Israel" (1983), offered a disturbing and 
controversial portrait of a country and a dream, both of which seemed to Oz to 
be mutating beyond recognition. 
</P>
<P>
Although never intended as a reflection of the country as a whole, the book 
exposed Oz to charges of deliberately confusing fact and fiction. Even by the 
worrisome standards of the day, critics argued that people Oz interviewed, such 
as the self-proclaimed "Isranazi," an Israeli extremist, were unlikely to exist 
except as composites or even fabrications. 
</P>
<P>
Oz is without doubt Israel's best-known writer (although in terms of talent he 
says he may rank last in a triumverate, the members of which he won't name for 
fear of sparking a brouhaha), and he is revered in Europe and in Japan. He has 
written more than half a dozen novels -- notably "My Michael," "A Perfect 
Peace" and "Sumchi" -- several collections of short fiction, and three 
compendiums of essays, articles, addresses and editorials, the latest of which, 
"The Slopes of Lebanon," was published last month by Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. 
In recent years, however, Oz has sustained numerous assaults on his credibility 
as both journalist and novelist. 
</P>
<P>
His 1988 novel, an epistolary exercise called "Black Box," was denounced by 
Israeli critics as arcane and unwieldy. His latest effort, the as-yet 
untranslated "To Know Woman," was condemned for being too blatantly commercial. 
For many Israeli critics, this did not jibe with the author's well-known 
devotion to ideological socialism, or to the communal and egalitarian values of 
kibbutz life. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Oz recently left Kibbutz Hulda, his home since 1954. His 9-year-old 
son suffers from asthma; because of this, the family moved to the Negev desert 
town of Arad. Oz's kibbutz, however, retains title to the literary rights to 
most of his highly lucrative output. 
</P>
<P>
Oz was born in Jerusalem in 1936. His mother, who came involuntarily from the 
western Ukraine, suffered painful yearnings for her native country, and was, 
recalls Oz, somewhat of a failed poet. Oz's father, Yehuda-Aryeh Klausner, was 
a Russian-Polish refugee with a doctorate in comparative literature who found 
himself in Jerusalem at a time, says Oz, "when there were more potential 
professors of comparative literature than students." 
</P>
<P>
Oz inherited his parents' and a philosopher-uncle's love for poetry and 
literature. In 1954, however, the young man moved to Hulda, one of the 
country's oldest communal settlements, situated roughly halfway between Tel 
Aviv and Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
"This really was the October Revolution of my life," says Oz. "My father was 
was a right-winger, so I became a left-winger. He was a scholar, so I aspired 
to become a tractor driver. It proves, of course, that all rebellions tend to 
go full circle. I ended up sitting at a desk, writing novels." 
</P>
<P>
Despite initial difficulties in finding his niche in the rugged, Spartan, 
ofttimes unpolished kibbutz life style, Oz eventually became a member of Hulda 
and an outspoken enthusiast for the kibbutz way of life, which he continues to 
regard as "potentially wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
In 1961, after serving for 2 1/2 years in an armored unit, Oz published his 
first short story. A year later, he went to Jerusalem to study literature and 
philosophy at the Hebrew University. In 1965, Oz returned to Hulda, dividing 
his time between teaching at a local high school and writing the stories and 
novels which, critics would later maintain, revolutionized Hebrew literature. 
</P>
<P>
Oz's literary predecessors -- the writers of the so-called Palmach (the 
fighting branch of the Haganah (underground)) Generation -- believed Hebrew 
literature ought to purvey the heroic qualities of the Zionist endeavor. A 
veteran of the 1967 war and the horrendous tank battles waged on the Golan 
Heights during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, Oz has found little to love in battle, 
preferring to write about solitary, angst-ridden characters trying to find 
their ways in a turbulent, colorless, frequently violent society. He has found 
cause for gratification, he says, in the burgeoning number of Hebrewreaders 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
"When I was a youngster," he said, "there were maybe 600,000 Hebrew speakers in 
the world. Now there are 6 million, among them several hundred thousand 
</P>
<P>
Arabs, many of whom read my books." 
</P>
<P>
Oz is no pacifist. Nor does he maintain illusions about what he perceives as 
the deep-seated Palestinian desire -- whatever the recent pronouncements of 
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization -- to be rid of the Jewish 
state in its geographical entirety. 
</P>
<P>
Desires are one thing, however, Realpolitik quite another. Israelis and 
Palestinians alike, Oz believes, are realizing they must subordinate their 
grandiose dreams to the more niggardly demands of the present. What is 
required, he says, is a divorce -- a physical separation between the two 
peoples. 
</P>
<P>
"For many Americans," Oz recently told a group of Peace Now supporters in Los 
Angeles, "there exists the long-standing notion -- which has deep roots in 
Christianity -- that the word 'peace' is synonymous with reconciliation, 
compassion, goodwill and brotherhood. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, it is not. The opposite of war is not love -- it is peace. Our 
agenda is not to make love with the Palestinian people. There is far too much 
anger for that. It is to make peace by a separation of land and assets in a 
two-state solution." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the wrath that underscores "The Slopes of Lebanon," Oz says he is more 
hopeful now than he has been in years that an end to the conflict may soon be 
in the offing. 
</P>
<P>
In November, Oz embarked on a monthlong speaking tour in the United States 
timed to coincide with the publication of "The Slopes of Lebanon." In Los 
Angeles, he gave a reading from "Black Box" at USC, and met with supporters of 
the local chapter of Peace Now. 
</P>
<P>
Oz has vigorously supported that grass-roots Israeli movement since it was 
established in 1978 by Israeli combat reservists calling for the aggressive 
pursuit of a peace agreement with Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
Oz and the organization, at least in Israel, continue to suffer from a 
reputation for elitism. Both have been been slow to pick up support among 
non-European constituents, who today constitute the majority in Israel. Both, 
however, have made recent attempts to broaden their bases. Peace Now has 
established a presence, for the first time, in largely Sephardic Israeli 
development towns. Before leaving Israel for America, Oz himself ended a 
three-year, self-imposed embargo of the local media. One particularly sardonic 
Israeli columnist commented on that occasion that "finally, at long last, God 
himself has decided to climb down from his mount and speak." 
</P>
<P>
Oz's refusal to engage in interviews is said to have stemmed from a conviction 
that he had simply talked himself out. And not only in the company of 
journalists, but also in a series of essays and articles he had written since 
1982. 
</P>
<P>
These articles are contained in "The Slopes of Lebanon," which Oz regards as a 
sequel to "In The Land of Israel." They offer, in bits and snatches, as 
trenchant an analysis of the current Israeli scene as the two-year lag between 
its appearance in Hebrew and the publication of an English-language edition 
could permit. But his assessment in "The Slopes of Lebanon" of what Israelis 
call ha'matzav -- the situation -- may prove as discomfiting in the short term 
to those who wish the Jewish state well as his first book may have been. 
</P>
<P>
Israel, argues Oz, has in its short history become a backward-oriented society 
at grave risk of stagnation. Although a wistful yearning for the past -- both 
distant and recent -- had always been an integral part of the Zionism, 
excessive pining for past glories has been held at bay by the pragmatic, 
forward-looking and often utopian Zionist enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
The events of 1982, however, when Israel sought to rid Lebanon of the PLO and 
thus ensure its own hegemony over the West Bank and Gaza, snapped the tense 
equilibrium between these two competing inclinations. According to Oz's 
analysis, Menachem Begin's ill-fated military adventure grew not out of an 
attested desire to secure peace for the relatively tranquil Galilee, but out of 
the premier's neurotic compulsion to avenge the horrors of the Nazi Holocaust 
that had afflicted him, his family and his people. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, among the victims of Lebanon, wrote Oz, was the nature of his 
country: "the Land of Israel, small and brave, determined and righteous." What 
remained in its place was a country which, though by no means beyond 
redemption, faces an upward struggle to retain a meaningful vision of itself 
and its mission in the world, Oz says. 
</P>
<P>
These days, however, Oz places the onus for the war -- and for the seemingly 
interminable Palestinian uprising that came in its wake -- on a leadership he 
views as "cowardly and dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
The Israeli public, he believes, has not been provided with the information it 
needs to formulate and debate a realistic strategic defense posture. 
</P>
<P>
"Most Israeli leaders know, in their heart of hearts, far more than they are 
willing to say to their people about the prospects of a Palestinian state in 
the West Bank and Gaza," says Oz. "It is not generally known, for instance, 
that it is possible to defend the country against a small, demilitarized 
Palestinian state the size of Bermuda. Such a state, in itself, will not alter 
the balance of power in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't necessarily buy or endorse the PLO, of course. I have always regarded 
that organization as one of the most extreme and uncompromising national 
movements in the history of the 20th Century," Oz says. "But the recognition is 
growing among more and more Israelis that this is the enemy, and that the 
Palestinian issue is the key to the (Arab-Israeli) conflict." 
</P>
<P>
"How can one therefore explain," wrote Oz in an editorial in 1988, "the amazing 
fact that Israel would rather fight another ferocious war, and another, and yet 
another, against all of the Arab states -- including Iraq with its 50 
battle-hardened divisions, Syria with its hundreds of new fighter planes and 
thousands of tanks, and Saudi Arabia with its monumental arms stockpiles and 
endless resources -- than make peace with a tiny Palestine? 
</P>
<P>
"Israel behaves as though it is ready to withstand protracted conflict against 
the entire Third World, against the Communist Bloc, the European Common Market, 
and perhaps even, one day, the United States -- as long as it does not have to 
coexist with a tiny Palestine." 
</P>
<P>
The key to a settlement, says Oz, at least in Israel, lies in the hands of the 
Sephardic Jews, who are now a new and politically powerful Israeli middle 
class. These people, Oz believes, have received a bum rap, especially in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli Sephardic element is gravely misunderstood due to certain 
simplifications in the Western press. This is not necessarily out of malice, 
though there is much of that. It is simply very convenient to picture every 
Sephardic Jew as a chauvinistic zealot, an Arab-hater and a West Bank settler. 
</P>
<P>
"This happens not to be true. The ultra-Orthodox are not Sephardic -- they are 
Ashkenazic, European Jews. The ultra-nationalistic are Ashkenazi, many of whom, 
lately, tend to be imported from Brooklyn. The Sephardim are hawkish -- far 
more than I might like. But they are not fanatic. 
</P>
<P>
"Among most Ashkenazi hawks I find fear. To many Israelis of European descent, 
especially those who were traumatized by the Holocaust, the Arabs are Cossacks 
who wrap themselves in keffiyehs or, worse, believe there is a Hitler under 
every Arab mustache. 
</P>
<P>
"Among Sephardic Jews, though, you find anger. And anger, I have learned, is 
easier to diffuse than fear. The Sephardic Jews will soon reconsider the 
occupation of the West Bank not for moral reasons or public relations concerns 
but, rather, for practical reasons. Is is a good deal, they will ask, or a bad 
deal? If they have to chose between maintaining the occupation and their newly 
acquired second-hand cars, they will chose the latter. 
</P>
<P>
"For this reason, I think we may well be watching the final storms before the 
lull. I would not want to be held to a timetable, but I think the conflict 
between Israeli and Palestinian may be on the ebb. The intellectual and 
political mobility in Israel today is greater than it has ever been. People are 
reassessing their positions. 
</P>
<P>
"Israel is still split down the middle between those who favor a territorial 
compromise and those who don't. But if the left gains one Likud supporter for 
every three people the Likud loses to the far right, we will have won the 
battle."

BRITISH NOVELIST PUTS HER STAMP ON CHARACTERS;

BOOKS: ANITA BROOKNER HAS EXPLORED HER THEMES -- ROMANTIC LOVE AND THE 
DIFFICULTIES OF HUMAN RELATIONS -- WITH ELEGANCE AND IRONIC WIT.

<TEXT>
<P>
Jane Austen's headstrong heroines. Barbara Pym's "excellent women." Anita 
Brookner's lonely intellectuals. 
</P>
<P>
Because she draws them so precisely, because she knows them so intimately, 
British novelist Anita Brookner, in a decade of writing that has produced eight 
remarkable novels, has come to be identified with her idiosyncratic female 
characters. 
</P>
<P>
They are difficult, honorable women. They are victims who suffer at the hands 
of charming if elusive men, who are defeated by frivolous if "plausible" women, 
who shrink before life itself and their own inability to negotiate its 
hook-lined crevices, to steal an image from Virginia Woolf. 
</P>
<P>
In one swift aphorism, Brookner tells us all we need to know about her women: 
</P>
<P>
* "Dr. Weiss, at 40, knew that her life had been ruined by literature." 
</P>
<P>
* "Blanche Vernon occupied her time most usefully in keeping feelings at bay." 
</P>
<P>
They are women who have been raised with the curse of good manners. And though 
having good manners is problematic -- "it means suppressing what you really 
feel and think," the novelist explains -- Brookner suggests that her heroines 
are victimized by their own reticence. 
</P>
<P>
"I think reticence, rather than good manners, is sort of essential, but it is 
apt to be misread," Brookner said in an interview. "People who are reticent are 
thought to have very little happen to them. But in fact they just don't talk 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
Brookner is reticent, even taciturn. Whatever the subject, Brookner often just 
doesn't want to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Her answers are usually short, sharp, direct. 
</P>
<P>
She is asked about the melancholy that seems to enshroud much of her writing: 
"I don't think it's melancholy. I think it's seriousness. I think there's a 
difference. I think people are frightened of seriousness." 
</P>
<P>
If people are frightened of seriousness, what is it that attracts them to her 
books? "The thing they're frightened of? Feelings." 
</P>
<P>
If the thorny question of romantic love and the difficulties of human relations 
have consumed many of her novels, Brookner has explored her themes with 
elegance and ironic wit. Her 1984 novel, "Hotel du Lac," won Britain's esteemed 
Booker Prize, and Britain's Spectator said it would "be read with pleasure a 
hundred years from now." 
</P>
<P>
Her most recent novel, "Latecomers," published in the United States last spring 
by Pantheon, has been hailed by critics as a "breakthrough." Jonathan Yardley 
in the Washington Post said that Brookner "works a spell on the reader." 
</P>
<P>
Brookner is 50, unmarried and lives in a flat in London. If the circumstances 
of her life suggest any similarities to those of her characters', she quickly 
dismisses the notion in a concise paragraph. 
</P>
<P>
"This is irrelevant. I mean, whoever reads the novels surely doesn't know me, 
so how can they assume that we're alike? It's based on ignorance. This is lazy 
thinking," Brookner said in her clipped accent, her voice deep, luxuriant. 
"These novels are not autobiographical. It's impossible to explain this to 
people who think that fiction is some kind of disguised fact, and that the 
novelist is a kind of . . . memorialist. This isn't the case. Novel-writing is 
immensely difficult. It's a projection." 
</P>
<P>
Brookner came to novel writing fairly late in life. ("I decided to try," she 
said of her first novel, "The Debut," published in 1981. "It was no big 
decision. It was almost idle.") 
</P>
<P>
Novel-writing had been an avocation to which she devoted her summer vacations, 
at the rate of one slim volume a year. Her real job was lecturing on art 
history at London's Courtauld Institute of Art. She had written three art 
history books -- on Antoine Watteau, Jean Baptiste Greuze and Jacques Louis 
David -- and established a reputation as an authority on 18th- and 19th-Century 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
But Brookner retired last year, not to devote more time to novel-writing, she 
said with a faint smile, but because "I was very old and it was time to go." 
</P>
<P>
Brookner, who has full lips, dark hair and dark eyes and taps her cigarettes on 
a writing table before lighting them, said that she will slow down her writing 
schedule. This spring she completed a novel that will be published in England 
next year. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really know that there's much point in talking about it," she said. 
"It hasn't really crystallized in my mind yet. It's quite slight. I enjoyed 
it." 
</P>
<P>
There is a novel between the one she doesn't want to talk about and 
"Latecomers." It is called "Lewis Percy" and is "about the sentimental 
education of a young man," Brookner said. Lewis Percy is a librarian who 
"marries the wrong woman, falls in love with an even wronger one and lives 
happily ever after." It will be published in England this year, in America next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
That will make two novels in a row in which her protagonists are men. 
"Latecomers" concerns two lifelong friends, Fibich and Hartmann, who as boys 
have been sent to England -- without their families -- from wartime Germany. 
</P>
<P>
She enjoyed writing "Latecomers" for a reason that may surprise loyal readers. 
"I find it more interesting to write about men," she said. "I think they're 
more of a challenge and I think they deserve a little attention. I think 
feminism has raised women to impossibly heroic status. And I think men must be 
given a little more credit for their hurt feelings than they have been." 
</P>
<P>
Her rich, utterly convincing portrayals of Fibich and Hartmann are likely to go 
a long way in dispelling any labeling of her as a "women's writer" and in 
bolstering her reputation for drawing characters with the scrupulousness of a 
master draftsman. 
</P>
<P>
"The novelist has to know her characters," Brookner explains. "I mean, every 
character is oneself. This is why it's such a profound business. You have to be 
all those people. It's not that all those people are you." 
</P>
<P>
And that is as much of a clue one is likely to get from the novelist about who 
she is. She will not, by choice, reveal herself. 
</P>
<P>
"I hate talking about it. Because I don't think there's anything there to talk 
about. I think that the books should be self-explanatory. . . . I don't think 
the facts of my life are of any help at all. What I've done or thought is 
irrelevant to the writing. I know people are curious but I can't satisfy that 
curiosity, except to say that it doesn't matter."

She is asked of her life in London, where she has lived in the same flat for 25 
years. "It's very dull, it's monotonous, deliberately monotonous because if you 
write I think you need to have everything taken care of. You need to know what 
you're going to eat, where you're going to be. It's very rigid and most people 
would find it unbearable. I find it very agreeable."

Brookner's father was a Polish Jew who immigrated to England. She has spoken in 
the past of feeling like a foreigner, an alien. Although Americans think of her 
as very British, the British see Brookner as Continental, Rosemary Dinnage 
wrote in the New York Review of Books. 
</P>
<P>
Brookner considered this idea. "I feel marginal, anywhere. I feel I have to be 
an observer," she said. "I mean, this is what I'm born to be."

The Deuce by Robert Olen Butler (Simon &amp; Schuster: $18.95; 303 pages). 
</P>
<P>
The 16-year-old protagonist of Robert Olen Butler's sixth novel, "The Deuce," 
has three names. He is Anthony (Tony) James Hatcher, the son of a Vietnam 
veteran, who lives with his father, now a district attorney, and his father's 
American wife, and later a succession of his girlfriends in Pt. Pleasant, N.J. 
He also is Vo Dinh Thanh, the son of a drug-addicted Vietnamese bar girl, Nghi, 
whom he hasn't seen since he was 6 and his father brought him to America after 
striking a deal with Nghi. And he is the Deuce, a runaway who spends most of 
his time in the Port Authority Terminal building in New York just off Times 
Square. 
</P>
<P>
"The Deuce" is the name the regulars have given 42nd Street, and it's the name 
a panhandling Vietnam veteran named Joey Cipriani gives the young protagonist 
after they meet up in the terminal. 
</P>
<P>
The complex historical and emotional legacy of Vietnam is only beginning to be 
sorted out, and there is certainly the promise of a fresh angle in a novel 
focused on a Vietnamese-American teen-ager who owes his very life to the war -- 
a war that split our society in two and, whether or not the war was won, 
virtually destroyed the country of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
Butler has a flair for rendering the dense simultaneities of New York. The main 
setting of the Port Authority, being circumscribed while at the same time 
endlessly various, seems well chosen, an opportunity to render the oddly cozy 
monotony and the wild-card uncertainty of the urban circuit. 
</P>
<P>
And in many passages, Butler does this very nicely. 
</P>
<P>
Butler is at his best in sequences where his protagonist is grounded in a 
particular setting and drama, but the greater part of this book reduces itself 
to repeated set-pieces -- like the map room at the main branch of the public 
library or the Lower East Side room in a boarded-up building that Cipriani 
shares with his friend -- where the Deuce does a lot of reflecting, frequently 
segueing back to his early childhood in his mother's rooms and in the streets 
and alleys of Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
One feels a little bullied by the "important," not to say sacrosanct, themes 
awash on every page of this novel, and it's this reviewer's guess that Butler 
himself may have felt a little bullied by them, too. 
</P>
<P>
The Deuce, after all, is a parent's standard teen-age nightmare: a 
self-important, humorless searcher with a very big chip on his shoulder. Does 
the fact that he is half-Vietnamese excuse the fact, or oblige us to listen to 
him endlessly as we would be less likely to do with his non-Vietnamese 
counterpart? In life, perhaps so. In a novel, not at all. "Remarks are not 
literature," Gertrude Stein said long ago to Ernest Hemingway. Nor is thinking 
storytelling, unless it gets very good indeed. 
</P>
<P>
In the penultimate chapter of "The Deuce," dramatic action comes to the fore, 
but it's as if it's been infected by the overblown, simplistic propensities of 
the narrator's thought processes. It's pure teen-age revenge fantasy -- with a 
knife-wielding homosexual pimp getting exactly what he deserves, thanks to our 
hero -- and it's supposed to bring the Deuce's long-winded identity crisis to a 
resolution. 
</P>
<P>
Butler is a conscientious craftsman who knows how to bring his backgrounds 
vividly to life, and there are places where his young protagonist touches the 
poetry of youth's perennial lonely search. But the Deuce seems too important to 
himself -- and to Butler -- to let enough life in to allow him to get real.

Publishers and bookstores count heavily on cash registers to 
ring-ring-ring-a-ling at Christmas. But yes, Virginia, there is publishing life 
after the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Although publishers tend to bring on the blockbusters during autumn and spring, 
the winter season is also more than respectable. 
</P>
<P>
Here is a look ahead to the bigger fiction titles due through winter and early 
spring. 
</P>
<P>

Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, the Barnum Museum is not for suckers. 
</P>
<P>
The three floors of the newly refurbished museum located in Bridgeport, Conn., 
are filled with memorabilia from the life and times of Phineas Taylor Barnum 
(1810-1891), the father of mass-market entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Welcoming guests to the first floor is a six-foot animated statue of Barnum. 
Visitors can find displays dedicated to Barnum's life: photographs, articles of 
clothing, his checkbook (his checks were imprinted with a picture of his first 
mansion). Video monitors offer bits of the 1986 TV film, "Barnum," starring 
Burt Lancaster. 
</P>
<P>
The second floor offers selections of 19th-Century fine and decorative arts, 
reproductions of Barnum's four mansions and a display of the many goods made in 
Bridgeport's factories since the beginning of New England's industrial age. 
</P>
<P>
The entire third floor is dedicated to Barnum's circuses and his American 
Museum in New York. Here you can find advance publicity material for singer 
Jenny Lind and scaled-down furnishings from the home of Gen. Tom Thumb, as well 
as a scale model of "The Greatest Show on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
The museum is open Tuesdays through Saturdays from 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and 
Sundays from noon to 4:30 p.m. It is closed Mondays and national holidays. 
Admission is $4 for adults, $3 for seniors and students, and $2 for children 
ages 2 to 18.

BARNUM MUSEUM SALUTES SHOWMANSHIP

<TEXT>
<P>
Nearly a century ago, in 1891, impresario P.T. Barnum made his final exit, and 
unfortunately -- certainly for him -- it was no hoax. 
</P>
<P>
However, Barnum has recently made a comeback in a scenario that could have been 
concocted by the old prince of humbug himself. 
</P>
<P>
It concerns his museum. 
</P>
<P>
When Barnum died, he left a building in Bridgeport, Conn., that could only be 
described as Barnumesque -- a bizarre mix of architectural styles topped off by 
a red-tiled dome. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the strangeness of the structure, and although Barnum was never noted 
for an innate sense of modesty, he never intended the building to be a tribute 
to his life. Rather, this was the Barnum Institute of Science and History, a 
museum for scientific and historical collections, the final gift of the great 
showman to his adopted city, which he truly loved and where he even had served 
as mayor in 1875. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, the building, which opened in 1893, has had a history that can 
only be described as sad. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, the city foreclosed on the building and then, under the 
leadership of Socialist Mayor Jasper McLevy, who did not believe in wasting 
anything, converted it to a city hall annex. Part of the third floor was made 
into a museum for the Barnum memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
The tiny attic museum remained virtually unknown until 20 years ago, when 
dedicated volunteers got together to try to make the museum bigger and better, 
to do justice to the memory of Barnum. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Pelton, a former schoolteacher and librarian who was also a Barnum 
enthusiast and about as knowledgeable as anyone on P.T., was hired as curator. 
</P>
<P>
Pelton supplemented the collection with lots more Barnum memorabilia -- 
original circus posters, the piano of Barnum's protege Jenny Lind, tiny 
carriages used by the famous midgets Tom Thumb and Commodore Nutt. 
</P>
<P>
During the past decade, Barnum aficionados from throughout America and the 
world have visited the museum. 
</P>
<P>
But the museum has suffered from both a shortage of money and nearly a century 
of neglect. 
</P>
<P>
Three years ago, the museum was shut down for emergency repairs to the roof and 
exterior walls. It was a stopgap measure. In an age of sharply rising 
construction costs, it appeared that the museum associated with the magical 
name of Barnum just might be at the end of the line. 
</P>
<P>
And then something happened: People's Bank of Connecticut announced a major 
redevelopment plan for parts of Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
Architect Richard Meier of New York, who loves the color white, would design 
the modernistic, 16-story, $108-million Bridgeport Center as a spectacular show 
of strength for a revitalized Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
There was only one problem: What could be done about the funny-looking, 
reddish, three-story building called the Barnum Museum, a relic from the 
Victorian age? 
</P>
<P>
What could be done, it was finally decided, was to take a new bank structure 
and wrap it around the back of the Barnum building. Strangely enough, the two 
buildings melded well, an arresting blend of the new and the old. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, the old museum building would need a complete face lift for its new 
status. 
</P>
<P>
And that is what has been done. 
</P>
<P>
An $8.5-million renovation -- paid for by the state, city and People's Bank -- 
is being completed. Outside, the structure looks about as it always did -- 
strange -- but inside it has been converted into a lighter, brighter, safer and 
more convenient exhibit hall, with such modern touches as TV monitors used in 
explaining exhibits and a catwalk to better see a scale model of "The Greatest 
Show on Earth." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, a new gallery has been built, connecting the museum and the bank 
building. It will house traveling exhibits, the first of which will be on 
carousel art. 
</P>
<P>
The most fascinating exhibits in the museum are those that delighted people a 
century ago -- a two-headed calf, Tom Thumb's tiny bed, and a 2,500-year-old 
mummy. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest star is P.T. Barnum, of course. 
</P>
<P>
A new wooden statue of him is the first thing people see when they walk inside. 
Also, a new image of him is perched above a miniature circus, floating among 
clouds.

NATURE CONSERVANCY CHANGES ITS STRATEGY; 
</P>
<P>
ECOLOGY: THE ORGANIZATION IS TRYING TO PRESERVE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEMS, RATHER THAN 
PIECES OF LAND THAT MIGHT BE HOME TO A SINGLE RARE PLANT OR ANIMAL.

<P>
From a rock outcrop in the woods off Route 156, the expansive view is one of 
brooks and streams, marshes and forests, all of it dominated by the massive, 
moving presence of the Connecticut River. 
</P>
<P>
What Leslie N. Corey Jr. of the Nature Conservancy sees from this outlook is 
more than the alluring landscape of lower Connecticut. He sees the conclusion 
of the biggest ecological system in New England, a scenic chunk of a 410-mile 
river that remarkably has escaped the worst excesses of the Industrial 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
So far, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
This river that begins as a rivulet at the Canadian border and ends in a vast, 
sprawling slab of water at Long Island Sound is the object of a new effort that 
constitutes the vanguard of conservation in America today. 
</P>
<P>
The Nature Conservancy, one of the nation's richest, quietest environmental 
groups -- and owner of the largest private sanctuary system in the world -- is 
using the Connecticut River as an example of a new approach to preserving 
natural areas. It is a difficult, time-consuming and costly attempt to preserve 
entire ecosystems, rather than pieces of land that might be home to a single 
rare plant or animal. 
</P>
<P>
Even for an organization with more than 500,000 members, a bank account 
approaching $100 million and a nationwide staff of more than 1,000, it is an 
approach that will require not only more money, but innovation, compromise and 
cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
"Saving scattered sites is not enough," said Corey, a vice president of the 
conservancy and executive director of its Connecticut chapter. "We have to find 
ways to link these sites together." 
</P>
<P>
One reason is that conservationists increasingly believe that small nature 
preserves are too vulnerable to damage from adjoining development, from a 
localized natural disaster or the more insidious threats of global warming and 
acid rain. 
</P>
<P>
What is needed, ecologists believe, are large natural areas tied together well 
enough that plants are buffered, animals have elbow room and the natural system 
can continue to interact. 
</P>
<P>
An example of what can happen to a small preserve occurred in July in Cornwall, 
Conn. Cathedral Pines, one of the last stands of ancient pine forest in New 
England, was flattened by a tornado. Had the preserve been larger than its 43 
acres, some of its 200- and 300-year-old white pines might have survived. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy also is applying the new ecosystem approach to preservation 
efforts on the Delaware River in Delaware, New York, New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania; a new tall-grass prairie preserve in Oklahoma; Big Darby Creek in 
Ohio, and the Carrizo Plains in California. 
</P>
<P>
Through the years, the conservancy has gained a reputation for moving swiftly 
to protect valuable, threatened land, often rescuing state governments unable 
to rush a land purchase through the bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
"They're an outstanding partner," said Vermont Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin, who 
worked with the conservancy last year to save several large parcels of 
threatened pristine lands. "We've worked with the Nature Conservancy in Vermont 
very successfully," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the Connecticut River project, the conservancy began by 
identifying 100 properties of urgent ecological importance. These were a wide 
variety of natural areas such as bogs, grasslands, old forests or rocky cliffs 
where unusual plants and animals could be found. 
</P>
<P>
Now the group, working in the four New England states drained by the river -- 
Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont -- is looking for ways to 
thread together all those areas and other undisturbed landscapes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not going to be a continuous preserve; it's impossible to do that now," 
Corey said. "What we have to do is work with what has been left undeveloped and 
identify what are the most critical elements of the system." 
</P>
<P>
The lower Connecticut River escaped major industrial development in part 
because its mouth is comparatively shallow and not desirable for heavy 
shipping. The area is rich in plant and animal life. As Corey spoke, a northern 
harrier flew across Lords Cove below, possibly the only place in the state 
where that hawk breeds. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of development pressure here," he said. "Land values have been 
escalating very rapidly. There's so much pressure because people want to be 
next to the river. We didn't have the vision to see, as the river got cleaner, 
everyone was going to get back on the river and use it." 
</P>
<P>
Looking at larger natural systems is forcing the conservancy to seek new tools 
and new approaches. Until now, if the conservancy deemed some land worthy, the 
checkbook was ready. In Connecticut, the conservancy has bought or has legal 
interest in more than 18,000 acres of land in scores of parcels. 
</P>
<P>
Although the conservancy's bank account has soared along with its membership in 
recent years -- nationally it maintains a $98 million revolving capital account 
-- it realizes it never could afford to purchase whole ecosystems, or even come 
close. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not going to buy the entire Connecticut River," said Dennis B. Wolkoff, 
the conservancy's eastern regional director, based in Boston. "So it is 
beginning to raise the question whether there are other protection tools we 
will have to use." 
</P>
<P>
In one creative approach in New York's Adirondack Mountains, which could serve 
as a model, the conservancy is completing a deal in which it bought the 
development rights to one 10,000-acre piece of timberland. But instead of 
paying the company in cash, the conservancy gave the timber company cutting 
rights on another 10,000 acres it owns. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy will end up with 20,000 acres preserved for no use other than 
logging -- at far less cost than buying it outright. The timber company will 
get twice as much land to log -- and reduce the value of its assets on paper, a 
not insignificant hedge against hostile takeovers. 
</P>
<P>
While the conservancy might once have opposed logging on its lands, it now 
believes that a healthy timber-based economy is important and that logging 
often is preferable to shopping centers or condominiums. "If that economy in 
northern New England can't be sustained," Wolkoff said, "then the whole thing 
will be cut up." 
</P>
<P>
One reason the conservancy has been able to work such deals with industry is 
its approach. Among the major environmental groups, the conservancy probably is 
the least confrontational. Demonstrations or blistering condemnations of 
polluters and industry are not its style. 
</P>
<P>
"We've always had a little bit of a lower profile," Corey said. "We tend to 
want to foster partnerships, whether it be with government or with other 
nonprofits, or local agencies or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
Growth of the organization has been striking. Incorporated in 1951 with a 
handful of members, the conservancy now has a membership of 540,000 -- 15,000 
in Connecticut. The Connecticut chapter has a yearly operating budget of about 
$600,000 and spends another $1 million buying and maintaining land. Counting 
the property it buys on behalf of public agencies, each year the chapter is 
involved in deals worth several million dollars. 
</P>
<P>
Nationally, it has through various means -- purchase, easements or a handshake 
-- set aside more than 4 million acres, an area larger than Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, largely because of its style, the conservancy has managed to 
avoid major controversy. But not everything it does meets with universal 
approval. Some advocacy environmental groups say that the conservancy is too 
quiet. 
</P>
<P>
And not everyone agrees land should be left wild. In Teton County, Mont., for 
example, ranchers complained the conservancy was creating "a grizzly bear farm" 
by assembling a wilderness preserve. They said the grizzlies, a threatened 
species, kill livestock. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the conservancy gets far more praise than condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
Its style is unabashedly businesslike; its membership and board of directors 
are typically well-to-do and educated, a blend of business people and 
scientists. In fact, the entire organization is a blend of science and 
business. 
</P>
<P>
"We do strategic planning," Corey said. "All of our people are evaluated each 
year on their performance. We are very performance-oriented, very pragmatic in 
the way we go about doing our business. 
</P>
<P>
"Our formula for going about doing what we do has been non-confrontational. 
It's been a process that respects the private property rights of individuals, 
of corporations, whomever. Our whole basis of land ownership is based on 
preserving individual rights, and the conservancy works within that and 
respects that, and that is why we aren't flamboyant." 
</P>
<P>
Quietly, the conservancy has created within all 50 states a computer database 
with information on all locations of rare plants and animals. Those data are 
drawn from scientists throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Though it is little known, the conservancy has given those databases to state 
governments to use in planning. 
</P>
<P>
The way the conservancy sees it, if a developer knows right away a rare plant 
grows on a property, the developer will want to take it into account in order 
to avoid conflict later. 
</P>
<P>
That database also helps the conservancy design major preserves, even on the 
scale of the Connecticut River project, which likely will proceed for many 
years. 
</P>
<P>
If it can, the conservancy starts by encouraging the owners of ecologically 
valuable property to donate it to the conservancy. In other cases it will 
purchase conservation easements, whereby a property owner agrees not to develop 
an area. If it needs to, and a property owner is willing, the conservancy buys 
the land outright. 
</P>
<P>
In recent years it has worked increasingly with the well-to-do, demonstrating 
the tax advantages of gifts of stock or land -- tax breaks that often allow the 
conservancy to buy land far below its market value. 
</P>
<P>
"Uncle Sam is the silent partner in every land transaction we do, because the 
tax laws in this country are set up to give recognition to people who are 
making gifts or some portion of a gift that provides public benefit," Corey 
said.

BUDGET CUTS MAY MEAN 8,000 MISS MEASLES SHOTS 
</P>

<P>
More than 8,000 children in San Diego County may not get measles vaccinations 
next year despite a fivefold increase in measles cases over the past year, 
county health officials say. 
</P>
<P>
"If we haven't got the vaccine, we're obviously not going to immunize," said 
Donald Ramras, county health officer. "If things don't change, my prediction is 
that some people won't get it." 
</P>
<P>
The problem is a money crunch in the state Department of Health Services. 
Officials of that office expecting a shortage for next year of vaccines against 
measles, polio and mumps, among other diseases, because of a 25% to 30% cut in 
funding and a rise in vaccine prices. 
</P>
<P>
The state health department's shortfall affects the counties, to which it 
distributes the vaccines. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been kind of a desperate situation for the last part of the year," said 
Loring Dales, chief of the immunization unit of the state health department. 
</P>
<P>
Dales estimated that about 35,000 children in the state will not receive any 
measles vaccine. Up to now, about 150,000 children in California had been 
inoculated at public facilities every year. 
</P>
<P>
Public clinics in several counties this year have on occasion had to turn away 
children needing any of a variety of vaccines, Dales said. If the public 
clinics do not receive more money, more children will be turned away in the 
second half of next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that it has ever been this bad," Dales said. 
</P>
<P>
State and federal funds buy the vaccines; the state bears 25% of the cost. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County administered nearly 33,000 measles vaccinations in 1989. 
Officials expects the lack of funds to mean that 8,000 fewer children will be 
vaccinated. Ramras said the shortage will be felt by July or August next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Our bottom-line projection is that the county will need about $350,000" more 
to be able to vaccinate the children who need it, Ramras said. 
</P>
<P>
The county has had 182 cases of measles this year, contrasted with 34 cases 
last year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding the problem is a recommendation to be published Friday by the 
Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The centers recommend that children 
receive two doses of measles vaccine -- the first at 12 to 15 months of age and 
the second around 4 to 6 years of age. The centers also recommend a third dose 
for college students and health workers. 
</P>
<P>
The county would need $835,000 more to comply with that recommendation, Ramras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the cost of added inoculations, the recommendation has been long 
overdue, said James Connor, professor of pediatrics at the UC San Diego School 
of Medicine. The American Academy of Pediatrics issued a statement in July 
recommending that children also be inoculated for measles when they enter 
junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
The CDC recommendation was prompted by concern about vaccine failure, a problem 
that has become apparent in the past two to three years, said Dr. William 
Atkinson, a medical epidemiologist at the centers' immunology division. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson said that about 40% of measles cases in the United States involve 
patients who have been vaccinated. Atkinson explained that the vaccine will not 
work if it is left in the light or at room temperature too long. He also said 
that it will not work if given to a child younger than 1 year. 
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that the measles vaccine itself is "one of the better ones we 
have," with an effectiveness rate of 95%. 
</P>
<P>
But he says that people should be vaccinated more than once to be on the safe 
side. "We believe that about 75% of individuals who do not respond to the first 
dose will respond to a second dose," he said.

LETTERS TO SANTA LEAD TO SPECIAL DELIVERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Santa Ana girl wrote to Santa Claus last month, asking for a new pair of 
shoes and a better life for her parents. 
</P>
<P>
"You are my best friend," Nancy wrote. "I am glad you are a good Santa." 
</P>
<P>
This week, she got a reply: a letter from Santa and, sure enough, new shoes. 
Workers at the post office in Santa Ana were busy answering letters to the 
North Pole from hopeful kids and arranging to have some of the Christmas wishes 
fulfilled as part of Operation Santa Claus. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, when the first letter to Santa arrived, the post office has 
received almost 1,000 letters addressed to the North Pole, said Joseph 
Breckenridge, a U.S. Postal Service spokesman. All will get replies from Santa. 
</P>
<P>
Postal workers in their spare time separated letters that showed indications 
that a child was part of an affluent family from letters thought to indicate a 
low-income family, he said. Companies, charity groups and individuals then took 
the letters and bought the presents. 
</P>
<P>
About 20 county residents took up the cause, buying gifts for about 100 
children who asked for items ranging from Nintendo games to a dresser. 
</P>
<P>
"We had armloads of presents this year," Breckenridge said. "This is the first 
year that it really took off." 
</P>
<P>
He added that last year -- the first time the Santa Ana office held the gift 
drive -- just two people participated. They also raised money through the 
Startree Project, in which gifts were delivered directly to local elementary 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
New York post offices started Operation Santa Claus 63 years ago, when 
employees felt bad about all the wasted letters to Santa and began writing 
back. The program in New York has since grown to accommodate 18,000 letters a 
year, said Andy Sozzi, the service's communications manager. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the New York office has no employees working full-time on the program, 
relying instead on volunteers and charity groups to help, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To her surprise, Ivette Serrano, 9, of Huntington Beach received a few gifts 
Friday. A postal carrier delivered a 2-foot-by-2-foot box to her apartment, 
where she lives with her parents, Albert and Gloria, and brother, Albert Jr. 
</P>
<P>
When she opened the box, unable to wait until Christmas, she found purple 
slippers, pencils, pens and a note pad -- most of what she wanted. It was a 
welcome reminder of the holiday season for family members, who have so far not 
had much time for Christmas because her grandfather is seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
The Operation Santa Claus package "was a surprise to me, because I said, 'Where 
did you get that from?' and we had no idea," Gloria Serrano said. 
</P>
<P>
Ivette had written to Santa two weeks ago, although she had been a bit 
skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid to write," she said. "I really didn't believe my Dad when he told 
me that he (Santa) would write back." 
</P>
<P>
She also wrote that she wanted a job for her father. He got one. He found out 
last week that he had been hired to paint a house in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe in Santa Claus," Albert Serrano said. "It's nice to know you are 
working for Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
Postal workers at times have difficulties deciding who is genuinely in need of 
gifts. Workers had to judge from the contents of letters. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a judgment call," Breckenridge said. "If someone is asking for 16 
Nintendo cartridges and is from Mission Viejo, you can surmise that they are 
affluent. 
</P>
<P>
"We can be conned. We don't run a TRW (credit check) on them." 
</P>
<P>
But postal workers have run across few fake cases. Many, instead, have been 
heartwarming, Breckenridge said. 
</P>
<P>
One Santa Ana girl, who has nine brothers and sisters, wrote to Santa wanting 
new pairs of shoes for each of them. She wrote down each of her siblings' sizes 
and their names on the letter, postal employee Steve Burr said. The wish was 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
Other children have written to ask for rent money for their apartment, earrings 
for their mother and even that separated parents get back together. 
</P>
<P>
Some requests cannot be answered. Grace, a 9-year-old Anaheim resident, wrote 
in her letter: "I'm not good at school or home, but I try hard, so please here 
my list: I want or can I have. . . . never mind about toys. I just want my 
family back in peace and my dad comes back from China. Please try hard! But if 
failed I still love and trust you." 
</P>
<P>
Those who donated gifts selected the letters, bought the gifts and brought them 
to the post office. Postal carriers delivered the gifts on their regular 
routes, Breckenridge said. Givers remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
Many people, he said, just like the experience of giving: "Some have come in 
just for the pleasure of giving presents to kids because their children are all 
grown up." 
</P>
<P>
One woman rushed Friday to buy gifts and get them to the post office so 
carriers could deliver them in time for the holiday. She had called just a few 
hours earlier on her car phone and was told about a letter from a girl in Santa 
Ana who had three sisters and brothers. The woman got presents for all of them, 
including skateboards and animated toys, Carr said. 
</P>
<P>
"She called in on her car phone and went out and bought," Burr said. 
</P>
<P>
Susan Young, an El Toro resident, bought musical tapes for a 10-year-old girl, 
who wrote wondering why Santa never brought her gifts any more. 
</P>
<P>
"She was very disturbed," Young said. "We went ahead and did what we could." 
</P>
<P>
A 49-year-old Tustin woman, who did not want to give her name, bought gifts for 
almost a dozen children, including one boy who only wanted dinosaur stickers.

Randall Toler is sure there are other critics out there of the state's aerial 
assault on the Mediterranean fruit fly, but he couldn't prove it by the turnout 
at a demonstration he tried to stage a few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
When just one supporter showed up, the Fullerton man had to scrub the whole 
thing. And a team of helicopters proceeded unhindered to spray hundreds of 
gallons of malathion mix over North County, with no hint of protest in the 
streets below. 
</P>
<P>
"The opposition just hasn't developed yet here," the self-styled environmental 
activist lamented. 
</P>
<P>
While the state's recent onslaught of aerial spraying has triggered growing 
resistance among Los Angeles residents and politicians, it has drawn barely a 
whimper among those in Orange County, even as the pesky Medfly has threatened 
to move deeper into the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The passivity is appalling," said Huntington Beach Councilman Peter M. Green, 
a human ecology professor who fears that the Medfly may be heading toward his 
city. "How people can allow some helicopters to come over their houses and dump 
poison on them, I don't know. I don't see anyone questioning this at all. I 
don't see it on anyone's agenda." 
</P>
<P>
The difference in reactions between Los Angeles and Orange County may be 
explained, in part, by contrasting temperaments, politics and loyalties in the 
two regions, political observers say. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, a community considered more conservative than Los Angeles in 
both its politics and its approach toward governing, politicians may be less 
likely to challenge the policy of a Republican administration in Sacramento, 
observers suggest. And that may be particularly true on an issue that many 
believe sharply undercut the political future of Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. in 
1981 through his failure to respond quickly to the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
But the biggest reason for the differing responses, politicians agree, is also 
the simplest: The Medfly has not hit here with the same severity and duration 
as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
If and when that does happen, officials caution, a political firestorm seems 
sure to follow in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Already, some North County residents, now facing as many as a dozen sprayings 
in their neighborhoods through the summer under an aggressive new state plan, 
have privately voiced fears about what the drops of pesticide mix may be doing 
to their bodies and the environment, not to mention the finish on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
A few dozen malathion critics in Orange County have even called county and 
state agriculture officials, contacted the media and attended city council 
meetings to question claims about malathion's safety. 
</P>
<P>
But whatever concern does exist has not translated into any visible show of 
opposition to the ongoing Medfly spraying, nor has it caught the attention of 
many politicians. 
</P>
<P>
With the lone exception of County Supervisor Roger R. Stanton, virtually all 
county leaders and North County municipal officials have voiced strong support 
for, or at least acceptance of, the state's Medfly spraying. 
</P>
<P>
With only a negligible influence over the state's policy, many local 
politicians view the spraying as "a necessary inconvenience" to protect the 
state's $16 billion-a-year agricultural industry. The raiding Medflies ravaged 
California in 1981 to the tune of about $200 million in damaged produce and 
eradication costs. 
</P>
<P>
Said Board of Supervisors Chairman Thomas F. Riley: "I'd like to think that we 
in Orange County have rationalized that our own best interests are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
And Fullerton Councilman Chris Norby added: "I think people pretty much accept 
the spraying. You sort of joke about it and say that it's there, and they'll 
spray, and we hope they get the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
"If you had a lot of people in the community rising up against it, we'd 
certainly listen, but that really hasn't happened," Norby said. 
</P>
<P>
In Los Angeles, the signs of unrest over malathion have been many in recent 
weeks: 90 people showed up for a downtown demonstration in one of several 
protests. Neighborhood groups banded together to create an anti-malathion 
coalition. And city officials formally asked the state to consider alternatives 
to spraying and are now looking at a possible lawsuit to ground the 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, by contrast, the Medfly has been a silent issue. 
</P>
<P>
"We've only had a few sprayings, and I don't think it's really sunk in yet," 
said Supervisor Stanton, who is openly skeptical about the state's policy. "I 
think we have to question this early on before we're literally doused in this 
stuff. If not, look out." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the Medfly spraying has been confined to an area just under 
10 square miles that includes more than 30,000 homes and businesses in parts of 
Brea, La Habra and Fullerton. The region surrounds the Brea guava tree where a 
pregnant Medfly was found Nov. 17, and borders several other finds in La Habra 
Heights in southern Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
But another fertile Medfly was trapped in Westminster about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
Because the sexually immature fly was not pregnant, state officials decided not 
to spray the Westminster area for now. But they nearly tripled the number of 
traps in the area to more than 2,200, and the discovery triggered fears among 
agriculturists that the destructive insect may have broadened its reach. 
</P>
<P>
To thwart any spread of the Medfly into South County, the heart of the county's 
$225-million-a-year agriculture industry, officials say they have no choice but 
to spray the infested area with malathion -- again and again and again. 
</P>
<P>
For North County and the other eight areas around the Southland where Medflies 
have been found, totaling 277 square miles, the new state program will mean 
helicopters overhead once every three weeks in the next few months, increasing 
to perhaps once a week toward spring. 
</P>
<P>
State officials anticipated from the start that their stepped-up spraying 
policy was likely to prompt public concerns. 
</P>
<P>
"People are quiet about it for a while, but then just the noise of the 
helicopters overhead ruining their sleep is enough to get people cranky," said 
Gera Curry of the state Department of Food and Agriculture. "We're sorry about 
that, but this was really the only alternative left." 
</P>
<P>
At stake, malathion spraying proponents say, is the very core of the state's 
economy -- its agricultural base -- in the face of attack from the Medfly. The 
insect is thought to destroy more than 260 types of fruits, vegetables and nuts 
by laying eggs in the skin and producing pulp-attacking maggots. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, which officials say imports about a third of California's $3.3-billion 
in agricultural products, has been monitoring the Medfly situation "very 
carefully," said Hiroyuti Kobayashi, agricultural counsel for the Japanese 
consulate in Los Angeles. U.S. official worry about a possible Japanese 
quarantine on California produce. 
</P>
<P>
And the powerful agricultural lobby, which supports the Medfly spraying, has 
made clear to Sacramento that "if we don't keep on top of this thing, there 
could be terrible consequences," said David L. Moore, president of the 
Irvine-based Western Growers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"My biggest concern is the (potential) public outcry," Moore said. "I hope 
people will listen to the scientific evidence and have the patience and 
fortitude to stay with this thing." 
</P>
<P>
Environmental critics, however, charge that the costly aerial spraying is only 
the easiest solution to appease the powerful agribusiness lobby; it is not, 
they say, the best. 
</P>
<P>
They assert that the state has not worked hard enough to find other 
alternatives to combat the Medfly, such as the use of sterile flies to invade 
and kill off the fertile population, fruit-tree stripping, and further ground 
application and trapping. 
</P>
<P>
And, pointing to past studies, these critics say the true health effects of 
malathion are not known. It may, they assert, cause cancer and genetic defects 
and damage to the nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
"The best you can say is that we don't know what this stuff can do," said David 
Bunn, a research director with Pesticide "The worst is that it can really do 
some harm." 
</P>
<P>
State officials assert, however, that scientific evidence shows malathion, used 
in low doses for the aerial sprayings, can kill off Medflies but poses no 
threat to humans. But public reaction has been decidedly mixed. 
</P>
<P>
Some North County residents in the spray area say they support the current 
strategy against the Medfly and believe state officials when they say malathion 
won't hurt them. 
</P>
<P>
Many seem most concerned not about the effects of the pesticide on their health 
but rather on their cars, as evidenced by the rows upon rows of 
tarpaulin-covered automobiles on spray nights and the long lines at carwashes 
the next morning. Then, too, they complain about the noise and disruption, 
likening the spraying to a scene from "Apocalypse Now." 
</P>
<P>
But some simply don't believe that the pesticide is safe. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to be the sad recipient of news 10 years down the road that 'oh 
goodness, we were wrong. This pesticide is deadly,' " said Kathryn Fine, a 
Fullerton resident who lives in the spray area. 
</P>
<P>
Fine was so concerned about the malathion that she addressed the Fullerton City 
Council at a meeting last week. She was the only person to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a shame that so many people are so lackadaisical," she said. At work in 
the public reaction are two competing forces, says Elaine Vaughan, an assistant 
professor of social ecology at UC Irvine who studies the way people view the 
risks of pesticides and other environmental threats. 
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, "people are naturally wary of pesticides and tend to overreact 
to the risk," often with little regard for scientific evidence or assurances 
from the government, Vaughan said. 
</P>

On the other hand, she said, "people tend to feel helpless when it comes to 
these large policy questions. And if they don't think there's anything they can 
do about it, they simply accept it."

SAN CLEMENTE GIRL, 4, HURT IN DRIVE-BY SHOOTING

In what is apparently the first drive-by shooting in the city, a 4-year-old 
girl was wounded by gunfire Sunday night during a Christmas Eve party at a 
neighbor's home, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was rushed to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission 
Viejo, where she was listed in guarded condition Sunday night, a nursing 
supervisor said. A relative identified the child as Lorena Caudillo. 
</P>
<P>
The girl, whose family lives on Avenida Pelayo, had been playing on the 
second-floor balcony of a next-door neighbor's apartment around 7:45 p.m., 
police and witnesses said. They said it appeared that she was grazed by a 
shotgun pellet below the left eye and perhaps on the torso. 
</P>
<P>
The assailants are believed to have left the scene in two cars, police said. 
Police said the assailants may be gang members but that no one was immediately 
apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
"I was in my room and I ran outside" to the balcony "because I heard her 
crying," said Lupe Lucio, 19. Lucio said the little girl was at her home for a 
holiday celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought a wine bottle had exploded and she had cut herself," said Lucio, who 
speaks Spanish, through an interpreter. "But then I saw the wine bottle hadn't 
broken, and I realized" that the sound that she had heard "was something that 
came from like a gun." 
</P>
<P>
Lucio said Lorena appeared "very, very scared . . . . She was crying a lot, but 
she was conscious and walking." Police on the scene also described the victim 
as alert. 
</P>
<P>
Lucio said she rushed the girl next door to her parents, who were to come over 
to the neighbor's home later to join the celebration. Lucio said she cleaned up 
the girl and tried unsuccessfully to stop the bleeding before paramedics 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Police said they were searching Sunday night for two cars believed to have been 
involved in the attack -- an older-model Buick and a Nissan, said to have been 
carrying about seven people between them. One of the cars may have been 
abandoned later in neighboring San Juan Capistrano, police said, and they were 
looking there for suspects. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Neil Murray of the San Clemente Police Department said the shooting is 
believed to be the first ever drive-by attack in the city. 
</P>
<P>
"San Clemente's not known for this kind of thing," Murray said. "We have a 
small, insignificant gang problem, but we have yet to experience any kind of 
drive-by shooting. This is very unusual for us. . . . You just don't anticipate 
something like this on Christmas Eve." 
</P>
<P>
Murray said Sunday night that "we don't know too much right now about what 
happened," but that "there's always the possibility of a gang connection.

<P>
It was just after noon last Veterans Day when Seal Beach lifeguards Jeff 
Aldinger and Adam Summers first spotted the trouble that would keep their 
adrenaline pumping for the next 53 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
At first, the problem was three surfers struggling against a sudden low tide at 
the mouth of the San Gabriel River. But as Aldinger and Summers worked to bring 
them in, the water level dropped nine feet. 
</P>
<P>
The current, normally 3 to 5 m.p.h., increased to more than 10 m.p.h. in 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Almost all of the surfers at the river's mouth were beginners -- and didn't 
know that they were more likely to escape the pull of the current by swimming 
parallel to the shore rather than straight for the beach. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything just blew open," Aldinger said. "The current took out maybe 20 
people all at once." The situation went to Code 3, the highest level of 
emergency, and a Long Beach lifeguard boat was called to help rescue the 43 
swimmers caught in the current. 
</P>
<P>
Between them, Aldinger and Summers swam and walked 28 swimmers to shore, 
according to Chief of Lifeguards Tim Dorsey. The boat took aboard the remaining 
15. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't have a chance to think," Aldinger said. "We didn't stop working for 
almost an hour straight." 
</P>
<P>
Four first-time surfers from Massachusetts thought they were "goners," Aldinger 
said, until the two men rescued them. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hard work, but I was glad we were there just when we were needed. It's 
a good feeling when you know you've helped, when you know the situation would 
have been worse if you weren't there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dorsey said he has seen the water level drop that quickly where the river meets 
the ocean about once every five years. 
</P>
<P>
Aldinger and Summers "were there when they were needed because they were 
vigilant," Dorsey said. "They were not in the guardhouse taking it easy; they 
were out patrolling. They were out there just in case. It was their vigilance 
that allowed them to be in the perfect spot, just in time to help." 
</P>
<P>
"I have to admit that was a tough day," Summers said. "But I wouldn't say we 
were heroes. I'm out here to do that, and I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
Summers, 24, who has a degree in social science from UCLA, is a pre-law student 
at UC Irvine and a lifeguard who says the beach is his first love. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of any place else I'd rather be. My office is on the beach, I 
work in the open air, I watch the sun set every day." 
</P>
<P>
Aldinger, 26, grew up in Seal Beach and spent much of his youth on the area's 
beaches. After high school, he got a degree in economics and "spent a few years 
in the business world" before becoming a lifeguard three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I love being on the beach, being out in the open and working with people, 
feeling like I make a difference," he said.

24-HOUR OMBUDSMAN TACKLES CAMPUS CRISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANNY SULLIVAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Long after other campus employees have left for the night, Ron Wilson's beeper 
will often drag him back to work at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, the university's ombudsman, is on call 24 hours a day to soothe hurts, 
solve problems and mediate crises. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson leans forward in his chair and speaks softly as he explains why his 
beeper is ever-present. It was just after Christmas a few years ago when a 
student whom Wilson had spent three weeks counseling committed suicide. The 
student had told his parents and friends he was gay, and they had rejected him. 
Wilson was on vacation at the time. 
</P>
<P>
"It was right after that that I decided to carry a beeper," Wilson, 38, said. 
He also started being more liberal about giving out his home phone number to 
those he is counseling. 
</P>
<P>
As the trouble-shooter and mediator for the campus, "Ron's on call essentially 
24 hours a day," said Vice Chancellor William H. Parker. "He'll be bailing a 
student out of jail on a Sunday evening, and Monday morning he'll be dealing 
with an executive vice chancellor." 
</P>
<P>
Parker said he is amazed at Wilson's ability to earn the confidence of all 
segments of the diverse campus and to resolve their problems. 
</P>
<P>
As ombudsman, Wilson has mediated a variety of crises, ranging from the 
humorous to the frightening. Once, when a local newspaper erroneously 
identified him as "Orange County's ombudsman," he received phone calls from 
senior citizens in Laguna Hills' Leisure World complaining about the tough meat 
at their local supermarket. Wilson took the time to make a few phone calls to 
the supermarket's management and to the meat supplier, which resulted in more 
tender meat. 
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, a student Wilson had ousted from the university for 
cheating and spitting at a teacher barged into his office carrying an Uzi 
assault weapon and accompanied by a friend with a pistol. The student, an 
Iranian, "told me that because his family had close ties to the Shah, if he was 
deported, he'd be in trouble," Wilson said. The student said he had permission 
from the CIA "to blow away anyone who got in his way," Wilson added. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson kept the student calm and ordered his outer office cleared. Then he 
excused himself from the office under the pretense of getting the student's 
records to review the matter, which allowed the police to arrest both men 
without injury. 
</P>
<P>
"You think, 'Anybody else would be crazy to stay in this job,' " Wilson said. 
But "you can't let one person who may be a little off-center decide whether or 
not you stay in something where you think you may make a difference."

A fire that raged through 900 acres of brush, grass and trees and torched two 
hay shelters was wrestled under control by firefighters who surrounded it 
Sunday afternoon, authorities said. The blaze, which broke out Saturday 
afternoon, was believed caused by children, possibly playing with matches, said 
California Department of Forestry-Riverside County Fire Department dispatcher 
Jeff Lloyd. He said an investigation into the fire's cause was continuing. 
About 225 firefighters from Orange and Riverside counties, the cities of Corona 
and Norco, and the state departments of Forestry and Corrections battled the 
blaze at its height, Lloyd said. No one was injured. The fire, declared 
contained at 2 p.m. Sunday, burned mostly along the Santa Ana River bottom, 
where it crackled through bamboo, brush, trees and thick grass. Although the 
damp river bottom provided some aid in slowing the fire's advance, the steep, 
slippery terrain also made it difficult for firefighters to get close to the 
blaze, Lloyd said.

Four people were injured early Sunday when a car crashed into an overheated car 
being pushed by three men along a freeway off-ramp. A spokeswoman for the 
California Highway Patrol said a car driven by Young Ko, 41, of Irvine struck 
the disabled car about 1:20 a.m. on the Culver Drive off-ramp from the 
southbound lanes of the Santa Ana Freeway. Ko apparently did not see the 
vehicle as it was being pushed from the side and rear by Salvador S. Figueroa, 
32, of San Gabriel; Carlos Ramos, 21, also of San Gabriel; and a young man CHP 
officers have not yet identified. Figueroa, who suffered broken bones and 
internal injuries, was listed in satisfactory condition at Fountain Valley 
Regional Hospital and Medical Center. Ramos is in fair condition with similar 
injuries. Ko is in stable condition at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. The 
unidentified man was taken to Humana Hospital-Huntington Beach, where he 
remains in stable condition.

COMMERCIAL BUILDING TO STAY HOT WHERE IT'S BEEN HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL FLAGG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anaheim. The Irvine Spectrum. John Wayne Airport. The coast. Rancho Santa 
Margarita. 
</P>
<P>
Those will be the hot spots next year in commercial real estate, as they were 
this year, experts say. Anaheim and the coast will be the place for new hotels. 
The Irvine Spectrum and Rancho Santa Margarita will be big on new factories and 
warehouses. And the John Wayne Airport area once again will be the hottest 
office market in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Let's take offices first. When all the figures are in, about 3 million square 
feet of office space will have been built in the county this year, estimates 
commercial real estate broker Grubb &amp; Ellis. That's about the same as last 
year. If you combined the two years, you would get more office space than is 
contained in one of the massive towers of New York's World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
But each year 3 million square feet gets leased too, so the vacancy rate for 
offices has not budged much from around 22% in a couple of years. That is high 
but not uncomfortably so, consultants say. 
</P>
<P>
Developers also want to get as many buildings constructed as possible before 
any government body imposes limits on growth. And the big-pocket partners many 
developers have taken on -- insurance companies, pension funds and the like -- 
are anxious to invest in Southern California real estate. So the buildings keep 
going up. Next year should be about the same, say local brokers: Three million 
square feet should go up, and three million square feet should get leased. 
</P>
<P>
A good many of those buildings will be constructed in the Irvine Spectrum, the 
Irvine Co.'s massive office and industrial park at the junction of the San 
Diego and Santa Ana freeways. Then there's the John Wayne Airport area, which 
has become something of a "downtown" for the county. 
</P>
<P>
"The airport is still the most desirable market in the county for tenants," 
says John J. Brodbeck, Orange County research director for Grubb &amp; Ellis. 
</P>
<P>
Factory, warehouse and laboratory space runs a considerably lower vacancy rate, 
about 14% for the 154 million square feet in the county. That's because land is 
so expensive in Orange County -- and industrial buildings usually pay such a 
low return by comparison -- that few are being built. 
</P>
<P>
The northern end of the county may see a slackening of demand for industrial 
space because manufacturers there tend to be either makers of low-technology 
products -- and thus most likely to flee the county's high rents and labor 
costs -- or aerospace firms that probably will be hit by cutbacks in defense 
spending. The newer, high-tech companies in the southern half of Orange County, 
however, still need a lot of space. 
</P>
<P>
So the hot spots in the industrial market are in South County, places like the 
Spectrum and the big, master-planned communities like Rancho Santa Margarita, 
where the developers are mixing offices and factories with residential 
neighborhoods. Between them, the Spectrum and Rancho Santa Margarita could 
account for more than a million square feet of new industrial space next year, 
according to their developers' projections. 
</P>
<P>
In hotels, says James Burba of consultant Pannell Kerr Forster, there won't by 
any hot spots in the county next year. Instead, he says, there will be "only a 
couple of what you might call lukewarm spots." 
</P>
<P>
That is because not much construction will occur next year. The action in 1990 
will be on cutting a deal to build on some of choicest parcels of land in the 
nation. The building will come later. 
</P>
<P>
At the Irvine Co.'s Irvine Coast, a hilly, breathtaking stretch of land between 
Newport Beach and Laguna Beach, construction will start in 1991 on the first of 
three hotels. Only Marriott has been signed up to build one; contracts for the 
other two remain to be negotiated. 
</P>
<P>
Two big sites in Dana Point that were controlled by an Australian company 
called Qintex for a few months this year are now up for grabs again after 
Chairman Christopher Skase ran out of money. Real estate sources say feelers 
have come from as far as the Pacific Rim. Here again, nothing is likely to be 
built next year, but there is certain to be much wheeling and dealing. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are four hotels planned for Huntington Beach, with one -- a 
Hilton -- actually under construction. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim will do moderately well because the convention center and Disneyland 
lure lots of tourists there. Occupancy rates are already in the neighborhood of 
the mid-70s, which is a fairly healthy neighborhood. The coastal resort hotels 
-- some of which may get a construction start next year -- will draw an 
entirely new class of upscale tourist, essentially creating their own market. 
</P>
<P>
That leaves the airport area, where a construction boom a few years ago means 
there are way too many hotels now. Occupancy rates are in the anemic 60%-70% 
range and hoteliers can't charge nearly as much as they would like to. The 
situation is getting better, though, and it is likely to improve still more: 
When the expanded John Wayne Airport opens next year, it could mean a big 
increase in business for these hotels. 
</P>
<P>
No new hotels are planned for the airport area next year, although developers 
are sniffing around sites that include the South Coast Plaza area, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel trouble spot is expected to shift to the northern half of the county, 
to cities like Brea, Placentia and Fullerton, where many hotels have been built 
recently and where the market is expected to be extremely competitive. 
</P>
<P>
All in all, experts expect the county's robust economy to once again provide a 
generous supply of office tenants, hotel guests and light industrial companies 
to fill existing and new structures. 
</P>
<P>
RED-HOT REAL ESTATE 
</P>
<P>
Here are the areas that brokers, consultants and developers pick as Orange 
County's real estate hot spots for the next year and beyond: 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING 
</P>
<P>
Cedarbrook in Aliso Viejo 
</P>
<P>
* Aliso Viejo: A 6,600-acre community being developed by the Mission Viejo Co. 
So far, 3,300 homes have been built, and as many as 500 new homes could be 
built here next year. The project eventually will have 20,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
* Rancho Santa Margarita: A master-planned community, including shops, 
factories, offices and homes being developed by the Santa Margarita Co. About 
1,100 homes were sold here last year and 200 new apartments units completed. 
About the same number of homes and apartments will be built in 1990. 
Eventually, the town will have more than 40,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
OFFICES 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co.'s Spectrum complex 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
* John Wayne Airport area: Emerging as Orange County's downtown. Half the 50 
million square feet of office space in the entire county is here. About 5 
million million square feet is vacant. This year about 1.5 million square feet 
of office space near the airport was leased. Another 1.2 million square feet is 
under construction and some big leases could be signed soon. 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine Spectrum: The Irvine Co.'s office and industrial park at the 
intersection of the San Diego and Santa Ana freeways. About 650,000 square feet 
was leased this year and another 600,000 planned for construction. 
</P>
<P>
HOTELS 
</P>
<P>
The Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
* Anaheim: There are 8,300 rooms in Anaheim's 17 biggest, most expensive 
hotels. The convention center and Disneyland draw thousands of tourists each 
year, and the occupancy rate was estimated earlier this year to be in the 70% 
range. No big new hotels are under construction, but several hotel developers 
are contemplating building here. 
</P>
<P>
* The coast: There are hotels on the drawing boards from Huntington Beach, 
where a Hilton is going up on the waterfront, to Dana Point, once a quiet 
little South County beach town and now a city of posh resorts. Not much will be 
built in 1990, but two or three big hotels will eventually go up on the Irvine 
Coast between Newport Beach and Laguna Beach, three more in Huntington Beach, 
and some will likely be built on choice sites in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
INDUSTRIAL 
</P>
<P>
* Irvine Spectrum: The Irvine Co. has about 3.5 million square feet of 
industrial space and has sold some of the rest of its land to companies that 
want to build their own buildings. The company leased about 800,000 square feet 
of warehouse and light industrial space this year and the year before. About 
the same amount will get built -- and is expected to be leased -- next year. 
</P>
<P>
* Rancho Santa Margarita: In an effort to ease traffic congestion, the Santa 
Margarita Co. has been developing its own industrial buildings near the housing 
it builds. There was 1.5 million square feet of office and industrial space 
either occupied or under construction here. About 545,000 square feet of space 
was sold or leased this year; next year it'll be 600,000 square feet, according 
to the company.

It'll be harder to sell a home next year in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
New houses are so expensive -- averaging more than $382,000 near the end of the 
year -- that only a tiny slice of the county's population can afford them. A 
lot of the customers for these pricey houses sold their older homes, using the 
equity gained from the boom in values. 
</P>
<P>
But the market for resale homes -- which is about four times larger -- has 
slowed down too. Prices, according to experts, are just high enough at a median 
$253,000 to be beyond most buyers' pocketbooks but not rising fast enough to 
entice a lot of people to sell. 
</P>
<P>
Altogether, sales of new and resale homes are down 27% this year, although that 
doesn't look quite so bad when you realize last year was an unusually brisk 
year for sales. 
</P>
<P>
For the county's important home building industry, the upshot is that builders 
have put up homes they haven't yet been able to unload in such places as Aliso 
Viejo, the area west of Mission Viejo, and the new town of Rancho Santa 
Margarita farther south and east. 
</P>
<P>
All this is a far cry from last year, when prices were rising so fast that many 
buyers jumped into the market with both feet, fearing they'd never be able to 
afford a home if they didn't buy now. Almost anything the builders cared to put 
up sold within days, and frantic buyers camped out in front of new 
subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
But beginning late last year and continuing through this year, the market 
slowed down. And it will be a lot slower next year, experts predict. 
</P>
<P>
"For a couple of years, builders had to know more about crowd control than 
selling," said Buck Panchal of the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm. 
"Next year they're going to have to spend a lot more time finding out what 
people want and how to market it to them." 
</P>
<P>
That means prices won't rise much: The most optimistic estimates put next 
year's price increases for new homes in the range of 5% and under. That's not 
much more than inflation, which is expected to be around 4%. 
</P>
<P>
And it's a long way from the astonishing 35% that new homes appreciated on 
average in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Buyers will be choosier, impelled not by fear of rising prices but by genuine 
need for a home. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the speculators have left the market, and the few people who can 
afford a new home have definitely sobered up. They're a lot more discriminating 
about what they're buying," said Kelly McDermott of Market Profiles, a housing 
consultant. 
</P>
<P>
The price of resale homes -- which accounted for about 80% of the roughly 
40,000 homes sold this year -- isn't expected to rise much, either. 
</P>
<P>
This year, for instance, the price of the average resale house will probably 
end the year about 14% higher. In 1988, during the boom, it was 25%. Next year 
it will be less than 9%, says Leslie Appleton-Young, an economist at the 
California Assn. of Realtors, which tends to look on the bright side. A 
gloomier appraisal comes from economists at Chapman College, who predict 
resales houses will appreciate only about 2% next year, or only half the rate 
of inflation. 
</P>
<P>
Sales could be down 10% or more, says Appleton-Young. 
</P>
<P>
"You just can't have prices go up 25% a year when incomes are going up only 
5%," she said. "Something's got to give, and we're seeing that it's the sales." 
</P>
<P>
Some brokers and builders concede prices may not go up much, but they say they 
won't fall, either. That's because, they say, unlike in the oil states or the 
slumping New England states, where home prices have dropped, the Southern 
California economy will continue to create tens of thousands of new jobs. And 
all those people will continue to buy houses even at high prices. 
</P>
<P>
That theory's valid, but maybe only partly so. If you look beyond the simple 
averages for home prices, you find that some builders have already dropped 
prices on their most expensive homes or are offering cash incentives to buyers. 
And some owners of older homes have taken their houses off the market rather 
than sell at a price lower than their asking price. 
</P>
<P>
"The fear that there won't be enough houses to go around or that interest rates 
would keep going up, all that's considerably dampened now. And that means the 
market's gotten soft," said Alfred Gobar, a Brea housing consultant. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy that owns a $200,000 house doesn't have to worry that much about an 
erosion in value," said Gobar. "But at the higher end, well, it's going to be 
tougher to get a high price." 
</P>
<P>
Looking beyond next year, though, a lot depends on factors far beyond the 
control of the county's big housing industry, such things as a recession or a 
rise in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a couple of trends that have emerged over the last few years will 
continue into the new year and beyond, according to experts. Some of them are: 
</P>
<P>
* The migration of the middle class to cheaper houses in the inland counties of 
Riverside and San Bernardino. Orange County has more jobs, though, so many of 
these people will drive back here to work over roads already clogged with cars. 
</P>
<P>
* The people who are left will buy more condominiums and townhouses, the only 
type of housing they can afford. A new condo cost an estimated $193,000 near 
the end of the year, almost half the $382,000 a new house cost. 
</P>
<P>
* Others will rent, and rents are expected to increase as the county's 
apartments -- an estimated 4% of which are now vacant -- fill up. The average 
rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the county's larger complexes runs between 
$575 and $775 a month, according to the Apartment Assn. of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
* Anticipating higher rents, investors are combing the county in search of 
apartment buildings to buy. Few owners are willing to sell, and prices are 
high. While vacancy rates are double the 2% of a few years ago, the high prices 
for the county's dwindling land supply are expected to keep apartment 
construction down and make owning an apartment complex very lucrative in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
* Some areas of the county that have yet to see a single home built on them 
will come a step closer to construction, particularly on the the Irvine Co.'s 
enormous landholdings. Among the projects making their way through the planning 
process next year: Seven thousand acres just outside the city of Orange; and 
the canyon areas just east of Anaheim. Construction could start late next year 
on the ultra-expensive homes at the Irvine Coast between Newport Beach and 
Laguna Beach. And Laguna Laurel, the Irvine Co.'s big community planned for 
Laguna Canyon, is up in the air because of community protests. 
</P>
<P>
* Houses will get still bigger on the average. Builders need to increase the 
home sizes to justify the high prices. Thanks to the enormous influence of the 
Irvine Co. on the market, many of these houses will be the pastel-colored 
Mediterranean affairs favored by company Chairman Donald L. Bren. 
</P>
<P>
* Everything else, of course, depends on roads: The big question is whether 
enough of them can be built in time, since growth shows no signs of abating 
either through an economic downturn or by some form of government fiat. Orange 
County has grown so fast that it has outstripped the capacity of its roads, and 
things are almost certainly going to get worse. The building industry this fall 
failed to persuade the county's voters to tax themselves another penny on the 
sales tax to raise money for building roads. 
</P>
<P>
In the future, some experts worry, high home prices and the deteriorating 
quality of life here -- symbolized by the horrendous commutes many Southern 
Californians endure daily on the freeways -- may turn out to be as big a threat 
to the Southland's economy as cutbacks in defense spending or slumping computer 
sales.

At the outset of the '80s, if someone asked me where Orange County was, I'd 
have said "in New York state." (Yes, they have one too.) It wasn't until 1985 
that I left Berkeley for the land of nodding oil pumps, aerobics acolytes, 
not-in-my-back-yard conservatives and passionate love affairs with money and 
earthly goods. 
</P>
<P>
So my view of the decade has a certain Johnny-come-lately flavor, I'll admit. 
On the other hand, it's probably just as well I wasn't around in the bean-field 
days, when the art scene that mattered seems to have consisted of a promising 
museum in Newport Beach, a sleepy one in Laguna Beach and maybe a decent 
gallery or two. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, it doesn't take too much research to know that the big '80s news 
in Orange County visual arts was bricks-and-mortar stuff. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
* The Laguna Art Museum (which spiffed up its name from "Laguna Beach Museum of 
Art") built a $1.8-million addition that wrapped around the original galleries. 
</P>
<P>
* Re-dubbed the Fullerton Museum Center, the Museum of North Orange County in 
Fullerton got an $800,000 face lift. 
</P>
<P>
* Newport Harbor Art Museum commissioned internationally renowned architect 
Renzo Piano to design a $25-million building now set to open in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
* The Bowers Museum, which completes its $6-million renovation in 1991, finally 
came up with a plan to expand the original 1932 structure threefold while 
accommodating a possible future revenue-enhancing development on the site. 
</P>
<P>
* The Center for the Study of Decorative Arts opened in a converted home and 
garden in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
* Art also rode in on the coattails of the commercial building boom. The new 
regional office of Security Pacific Bank on Anton Boulevard in Costa Mesa 
contains a massive gallery dedicated to contemporary art. The Modern Museum of 
Art set up shop in Griffin Towers in Hutton Centre, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
* Art found its way into the lobbies and landscapes of corporate, retail and 
residential developments countywide, from the obsessively programmed Noguchi 
Sculpture Garden ("California Scenario") near sprawling South Coast Plaza to 
numerous undistinguished examples of "plop art." 
</P>
<P>
* As early as the mid-'70s, cities including Brea, Irvine and Newport Beach 
began developing well-intentioned, though not always well-executed, public-art 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
The energy that has gone into all these projects is not in question. Neither is 
the real need for more space devoted to art and more planning to integrate art 
into daily life. But the art building boom brings with it a couple of major 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
One is a general lack of awareness of the need to support day-to-day activities 
at Orange County museums. It's great to erect a bigger building or revamp the 
one you have. But the building is just a shell. A museum is only as prestigious 
and useful as its collections and exhibitions -- and the staff that scouts, 
researches, preserves and teaches us about them. 
</P>
<P>
It is highly likely that readers of this column pay their executive secretaries 
more than some curators and other key museum staff in this county make 
annually. Curatorial salaries at the Laguna Art Museum are under $30,000, for 
example, and only in the low $30,000s at the Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
These depressing numbers are more or less in line with salaries reported this 
year by the California Assn. of Museums: The average curatorial wage at art, 
history, science and youth museums in the same budget range -- $1 million to $3 
million -- is $32,702. But the higher-than-average cost of living in Orange 
County makes such a salary seem most unprofessional. It's time for donors to 
come to the rescue. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to financial support, Orange County also owes its museums moral 
support. These days, art that doesn't reflect "mainstream" ideas about sexual 
and political issues has come under vituperative attack from conservative 
politicians, including our own Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Lomita). 
</P>
<P>
A museum's true friends will continue to support the right -- the obligation -- 
of an art institution to show work that reflects whatever points of view the 
significant artists of our day wish to express. 
</P>
<P>
The second problem has to do with quality control. I'm thinking of the man who 
called to tell me about a presentation an art consultant was going to give to a 
group of Irvine residents interested in public art. The consultant's name was 
not familiar to me, so I asked how she was chosen. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh," came the answer, "she sent us some materials and she sounded real 
enthusiastic and said she could help." 
</P>
<P>
Now, it's doubtful that my caller would have gone about selecting a 
stockbroker, a Realtor or a computer consultant in such a happy-go-lucky way. 
The same people who scratch their heads over "difficult" contemporary art 
somehow tend not to realize how specialized a field art is and how little they 
know about it. 
</P>
<P>
Committees deciding the nature of the art to be placed in a city or a private 
development too often fail to enlist the services of people who are on top of 
recent developments in contemporary art -- not interior decorators or folks who 
may have taken an art course or two, but art-world people with major 
reputations. 
</P>
<P>
With proper guidance -- and some serious research on their own -- a "lay" 
committee can select an innovative, thoughtful artist who reflects the issues 
of our time rather than simply the first person whose price sounds good or an 
individual touted by some self-proclaimed art consultant. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are always committee members who "just want something pretty" 
and don't want do get involved with the gnarly, off-putting and unconventional 
world of la-de-da contemporary art. But that's like saying you never want to 
take a trip to a country where they speak a different language, or deciding 
you'll never read about child development theories because kids are so cute and 
cuddly and you don't want to get disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
The fallout from this point of view is all over the map in Orange County. Was a 
blandly traditional sculptor like Marton Varo really the best choice for Brea's 
"artist in residence"? (Who else was in the running, anyway?) Would reputable 
art professionals have chosen silly figurative sculptures by one Paolo Borghi 
for the intersection of Jamboree Road and Campus Drive in Irvine? 
</P>
<P>
Is it appropriate for the new Costa Mesa Tourism, Arts and Promotion Council to 
disburse city money without serious, ongoing consultation with the people whose 
working lives are intimately connected with the arts? These questions keep 
coming as more and more people in the county view art as an indispensable 
"amenity." 
</P>
<P>
There are some bright spots, of course, like "California Scenario" and the 
laudable efforts of Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach to acquire a significant 
work of sculpture for the lobby of its new Patty and George Hoag Cancer Center. 
(The committee, which included Newport Harbor Art Museum chief curator Paul 
Schimmel as well as prominent collectors, chose a sprightly piece by major 
American artist Nancy Graves.) 
</P>
<P>
But until the quality of art outside of our top museums is equal to the quality 
frequently represented inside their walls, Orange County will merely confirm 
the notion that this part of the world is a provincial outpost of Los Angeles . 
. . the land of nodding oil pumps, aerobics acolytes, not-in-my-back-yard 
conservatives and passionate love affairs with money and earthly goods.
