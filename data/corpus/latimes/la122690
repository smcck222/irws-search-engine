PHONE COMPANY GOOFS ON BILLINGS FOR CALLS

About 25,000 families and friends of people serving in the Persian Gulf were 
mistakenly billed for calls that were supposed to be free, and the charges will 
be canceled, AT&amp;T officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. had offered to let servicemen and women 
in the gulf make the free calls during Thanksgiving week, Nov. 20 to Nov. 27, 
and 140,000 calls were made. 
</P>
<P>
But some local phone companies did not follow through on instructions not to 
bill the troops' families for these calls, company spokesman Richard 
Wallerstein said. The calls were placed to families all over the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Wallerstein said no one will have to pay for the bills, no matter how high they 
were. He said he had heard some of the bills had reached $500, but he had no 
definitive information. 
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported Tuesday that bills sent to some soldiers' families 
soared as high as $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
The offer was for one three-minute call per soldier, but Wallerstein said 
AT&amp;T had no way to enforce the limit. 
</P>
<P>
The offer cost the company more than $1 million, Wallerstein said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, AT&amp;T announced Monday a free call-home campaign for U.S. Navy 
sailors and Marines stationed on ships in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The offer is good through New Year's Eve, and Wallerstein said he didn't expect 
any problems. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll just do the bills right this time," he said.

CHEER WAS CHORE THIS CHRISTMAS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
On Christmas, 6-year-old Kenny Leonard wanted to sail to the Persian Gulf in a 
boat, loaded with gifts for his father and a bomb for Iraqi president Saddam 
Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
After dropping the bomb on Hussein, Kenny said he planned to voyage home with 
his dad, who shipped out to the Middle East four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, that's better," sighed Barrie Leonard, Kenny's mother. "Last night, he 
said he wanted to swim there." 
</P>
<P>
For the Leonards and others separated from loved ones by the Middle East 
conflict, this Christmas was subdued as they struggled to celebrate a holiday 
that usually unites families. Arrington (Lenny) Leonard, a petty officer 2nd 
class, shipped out to the Persian Gulf aboard the San Diego-based destroyer 
tender Acadia. His departure was abrupt and plans for his return keep changing, 
as the U.S. increases its efforts to support Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas without Lenny is not quite the same, it doesn't seem the same," said 
Barrie Leonard, 30. "But we are trying to make it the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
Barrie Leonard intended to celebrate two Christmases -- one yesterday with her 
two small sons and one in March when she hopes her husband will return from the 
Persian Gulf. Then, she figures she will set up the artificial tree once again 
in its corner in the small living room in Imperial Beach. She and Kenny will 
decorate it again with their ornaments, including the hand-made ones and ones 
she got yesterday as presents. 
</P>
<P>
Since the couple decided to postpone Arrington Leonard's Christmas until spring 
and strapped by a $300 telephone bill (a result of her husband's calls from 
ports), Barrie Leonard sent no gifts. Barrie Leonard planned to send a care 
package of items he had requested: powdered beverage Gatorade, wheat germ, 
cookies, and a videotape of his family's Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas eve, with all the childrens' gifts wrapped, the stockings laid 
out, the house cleaned, the tree decorated, Barrie Leonard finally sat down to 
write her husband. The previous 
</P>
<P>
Christmas eve, the couple had stayed up until 2 a.m. as Arrington Leonard, 35, 
struggled to assemble a new scooter for Kenny. She wrote a brief letter and 
dissolved into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Darling, 24 Dec. 90 2256 hours 
</P>
<P>
 For you it's Christmas Day as I write, and for me it's still the magic of 
Christmas Eve. All is ready for when they wake up . . . I miss you so badly now 
and wish you were here with us. It just doesn't feel right for me -- not having 
you near. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a long long day. Tomorrow is bound to start early. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry Christmas my love! 
</P>
<P>
 I love you always -- Barrie 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When Barrie Leonard awoke on Christmas, there was scarcely time to add the big 
news into her letter: six-month-old Johnathan had cut his first tooth. She 
tried to videotape the new tooth, but Johnathan kept putting his thumb in his 
mouth. By the time her husband sees his youngest son again, Johnathan will have 
teeth and be walking, she mused. 
</P>
<P>
In the ten years of their marriage, Arrington Leonard had deployed before. In 
fact, he shipped out and missed Christmas two years ago. But this time, his 
absence is far more poignant as tension continues to build in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Barrie Leonard reassures herself thinking that his ship, a vessel that repairs 
war ships, would not be deployed in a combat area since it has little ability 
to defend itself. She tries not to think of the dire possibilities of war. She 
tries not to think of poison gas being used against American troops, whose 
numbers reached 280,000 several days ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't like to think about that," Barrie Leonard said. "Otherwise, I would be 
depressed all the time, I'd be sad all the time." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Barrie Leonard likes to think of her husband's return. She figures 
Kenny will spot him the first and run to greet him. Then Arrington Leonard will 
find her, holding Johnathan in her arms. Reunited on the dock, the family will 
have one of their "family hugs" where they huddle together while Kenny calls 
out: "Kiss left, kiss right." 
</P>
<P>
And on Christmas, she liked to think of her husband, who planned to go ashore 
for a buffet in Dubai. Arrington Leonard called his wife twice on Christmas 
morning. He sounded bright and cheery. To his wife, the only sad part was the 
uncertainty of his return. 
</P>
<P>
This was a very different Christmas. Last year, the couple had planned and 
shopped together for the children's gifts. This year, Barrie Leonard shopped 
with the kids along -- staging distractions as she placed key presents into her 
girlfriend's shopping cart. 
</P>
<P>
When the kids started tearing into their presents yesterday, Barrie Leonard had 
to orchestrate the event, pulling out gifts from under the tree -- a task she 
always shared with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny was immediately smitten by his new collection of GI Joe dolls and their 
battle station. He kept mispronouncing the name of one doll, named "Capt. 
Grid-Iron." Instead, Kenny called the tiny figure "Capt. Grid-Iran." 
</P>
<P>
Quickly, the GI Joe dolls were gathered to form an invading team headed for the 
Persian Gulf. Kenny gave instructions to each doll. But he halted when he got 
to the GI Joe that had "Navy" emblazoned across its chest. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't you think this one looks just like my dad?" he asked.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: SOME FUNNY THINGS ARE GOING ON AT SAN DIEGO CONDO COMPLEXES

Ready for a last bit of good-will-toward-men before heading into the 
self-absorption of New Year's? 
</P>
<P>
Meet the Litehearts (yes, that's their real name) of San Marcos: Joe &amp; 
Gayle, the condominium performers. 
</P>
<P>
The Litehearts also take their brand of upbeat comedy and TV satire to block 
parties, senior centers, shopping centers, parades (Joe was Santa in the Mira 
Mesa Christmas Parade) and resorts (Warner Springs Ranch). They're talking to a 
cruise line. 
</P>
<P>
But forget the Comedy Store or the lounge at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Litehearts figure the condominium complex recreation room is still their 
most desirable venue. 
</P>
<P>
"It's definitely a wave that's going to hit big," said Joe, 35, who got bit 
with the performing bug while working as a Gray Line driver in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The chipper couple has done gigs at condo complexes in San Diego, Vista, 
Oceanside, Escondido and Rancho Bernardo. They're signing up clients for return 
performances: mixers, holiday bashes, end-of-summer parties, etc. 
</P>
<P>
They do a mock murder mystery, with parts for the guests, including a guy who 
bores people to death with bad poetry. A TV jibe called "The Price Is Close 
Enough." One called "Amazing Bingo." 
</P>
<P>
They have a Fourth of July routine (they're big on patriotism). And one for St. 
Patrick's Day. 
</P>
<P>
They'll even throw in a wedding (they're ordained ministers). Or do benefits 
(Save Blue Bird Canyon From Trash). 
</P>
<P>
A condo complex in Clairemont hired the Litehearts for a party to lift the 
spirits of residents shaken by the specter of a serial killer in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Is there a living in door-to-door heartwarming stuff? At $75 to $300 per show? 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't had to take a day job in two years," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
In show business, that's called success. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, on the Home Front . . . 
</P>
<P>
The home front. 
</P>
<P>
* A few good boas. 
</P>
<P>
The North County Humane Society in Oceanside now has a foster home service for 
pets left behind by Marines from Camp Pendleton sent to Saudi Arabia. So far, 
150 homes. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs and cats are easy to place. Snakes take longer. 
</P>
<P>
* Santee singer Chase Jonathan Jazzborne has recorded "A Message for GI Joe": 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you die for me 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a fight, remember we have SUPERIORITY! 
</P>
<P>
 Just stay on guard . . . 
</P>
<P>
* A dozen Navy ships supporting Operation Desert Shield were built or outfitted 
at Nassco in San Diego, including two hospital ships. 
</P>
<P>
* Members of the Solana Beach-based Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of San 
Dieguito are wearing white ribbons to symbolize their hope for a peaceful 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
* A peace vigil is held each Saturday morning at the downtown post office in 
Carlsbad. 
</P>
<P>
* The Navy is putting off-limits to sailors and Marines any stores in San Diego 
thought to be ripping off Saudi-bound troops. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Sound and the Fury 
</P>
<P>
Here and there. 
</P>
<P>
* An angry homeowner in Encinitas made a citizen's arrest on a guy operating 
one of those big blowers/sweepers early Sunday morning in a shopping center 
parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
Local ordinance bans the noisy monsters on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
* The Sierra Club "report card" on San Diego City Council members turned into a 
fiasco of charges and countercharges about how the grades were done. 
</P>
<P>
But that hasn't stopped other interest groups from wanting to join the fun. 
</P>
<P>
Both Prevent Los Angelization Now and the Building Industry Assn. plan similar 
report cards.

BREATHING LIFE INTO DREAMS FOR RIVER PARK; 
</P>
<P>
PRESERVATION: LACK OF MONEY FOR LAND PURCHASES REMAINS BIGGEST OBSTACLE TO SAN 
DIEGUITO RIVER VALLEY REGIONAL PARK, BUT SOME DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED WITHIN 
THE NEXT YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like an infant that finally rolls over in its crib while doting parents talk of 
future weightlifting championships, the fledgling San Dieguito River Valley 
Regional Park is both blessed and burdened by expectations. 
</P>
<P>
Its guardians hope that some day the park will be a 55-mile-long wildlife and 
greenbelt corridor, winding from the beach at Del Mar, along the San Dieguito 
River, threading between the estates of Rancho Santa Fe and Fairbanks Ranch, 
along the bottom of the Santa Fe Valley, across Lake Hodges and up the 
agricultural San Pasqual Valley preserve, alongside Ramona and Santa Ysabel, 
and finally up the side of Volcan Mountain near Julian. 
</P>
<P>
For all the talk, today the 1 1/2-year-old park agency only owns 89 acres -- 
valuable wetlands alongside the Del Mar Fairgrounds. And that purchase only 
came last Friday. Until then, and to the frustration of those who question 
whether the park will ever come to be, it had existed only in bureaucratic 
documents, like adoption papers for an unborn child. 
</P>
<P>
But now that the park agency has made its first critical purchase, its 
guardians are buoyed and proclaim that skeptics should now take the park 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
And attention turns to other acquisitions and the development of park amenities 
-- picnic grounds, trails, cultural and nature interpretive centers -- on land 
already in public ownership, and which might be able to be completed within a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Still, no one expects this child of a park to reach maturity any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see how many years it takes to develop even small park projects, I know 
that I won't be around when this one's completed," remarked Diane Coombs, 
executive director of the San Dieguito River Park authority. 
</P>
<P>
And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
Reflected in the yearlong negotiations it took just to acquire the 89 acres of 
lagoon and river bottom on the south side of the Del Mar Fairgrounds, between 
Interstate 5 and Jimmy Durante Boulevard -- the park agency's challenge is in 
wresting control of thousands of acres of private land. 
</P>
<P>
Because some of the land is prime commercial and residential property, it may 
eventually cost hundreds of millions of dollars to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
For people like Coombs, it's like walking into a swanky jewelry store and being 
dazzled by the array of gems, but only having a few bucks in your wallet and a 
dismal credit limit on plastic and hoping that some sugar daddy will come along 
and bail you out. And, all the while, you sense the well-heeled customers 
standing over you and breathing down your neck, ready to snatch the gem away 
before you can muster your own resources. 
</P>
<P>
This is a park agency rich with dreams -- of fantasies of developing the 
county's most unusual regional park -- and poor in funding to make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, for all of the county's existing and planned parks -- from Mission Bay 
to the Tijuana River to Mission Trails near Santee -- the San Dieguito Park is 
said by officials to be the most ambitious undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
It could eventually provide a continuous habitat corridor for wildlife from the 
ocean to the mountains, and an aesthetic and symbolic swath of open space in 
areas now pummeled by the pressure of new residential and commercial 
development. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to protect this land as a park for future generations," said Mike 
Gotch, who for several months headed the park agency and who was sworn in Dec. 
3 as a new state assemblyman. "It's a choice of what kind of legacy we want to 
prepare -- one of development and growth, or one of preservation of natural 
resources that, once lost, could never be regained." 
</P>
<P>
Typical of that either-or option is Boden Canyon, a bucolic, 1,500-acre valley 
near Ramona with stands of sycamores, oaks and willows bordering creeks and 
ponds, providing treasured riparian habitat for deer and mountain lion alike. 
</P>
<P>
The owners' managing partner is Roger Steppe, a Tustin-based developer of 
residential and mobile-home park projects around the nation. His group at one 
time planned to build a gated community featuring 40-acre estate lots and a 
golf course, but he said he had second thoughts after learning of the San 
Dieguito River Valley Park. 
</P>
<P>
"None of us really ever own land. We're just caretakers," he said. "So the 
question is, do we destroy the land and build buildings, or do we preserve the 
land and make a difference in people's lives? 
</P>
<P>
"Do I want to leave behind a high-rise as my legacy, or do something for kids, 
who can walk down a dirt path away from the video games and neon signs and get 
their hands dirty. I don't think we can afford not to do that." 
</P>
<P>
So Steppe has been meeting with the park staff for months, negotiating the sale 
of the property that he described as "having the most character of any land in 
San Diego County." 
</P>
<P>
And, although he said the property has been appraised at $20 million, he's 
willing to sell it for about $15 million. "I've been fighting off attempts by 
deep-pocket foreigners to buy it, and I've got a waiting list of people in 
Orange County who want to buy estate lots there because they know how beautiful 
that land is -- just as people in Los Angeles knew years ago how beautiful the 
land was in Orange County. But I'm tired of serving the rich," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, though, is that the park doesn't have the money to buy the land 
just yet. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the Trust for Public Land, a private, nonprofit agency that helps public 
agencies acquire private land for parks and open space. 
</P>
<P>
The trust serves as a middle-man by buying land with its own line of credit, 
then holding on to it until public funding is available to, in turn, buy it for 
public use. 
</P>
<P>
The trust is meeting with Steppe -- and trying to assess, at the same time, if 
public money will come down the pipeline for the purchase of Boden Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to negotiate for a bargain sale," said Neil Gaston, an attorney 
for the organization who toured the property last week with park officials and 
state legislators. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of (state and federal) money out there," he said of the 
resources that could be tapped for parkland acquisition. "But it's a question 
of whether this park fits into the logical pool of funds that are available. 
It's up for others to decide." 
</P>
<P>
Those others include state legislators -- such as Assemblywoman Lucy Killea 
(D-San Diego), who also toured Boden Canyon to see for herself how valuable it 
could be as a park. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, she offered a cautious assessment, saying the park deserves funding 
-- but has to get in line with other projects. "We just don't have a lot of 
outstanding park money available," she said. "Maybe the picture will improve in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
"But we've got 20 years or more to do this. We have to take manageable bites of 
the park. This project is overwhelming. We need to see the entire picture, but 
it's got to be broken down into smaller pieces. It was a big victory just to 
form the joint-powers authority." 
</P>
<P>
Flush from their acquisition of the lagoon property, park officials are also 
looking at two other critical pieces of the park puzzle besides Boden Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
They covet 317 acres of agricultural and potential residential land between El 
Camino Real and I-5, now owned by the San Dieguito Partnership. 
</P>
<P>
The trust is represented by developer Roy Collins on behalf of, among others, 
UC San Diego founder Roger Revelle. The property is zoned for agricultural use 
and residential development and, because of its freeway frontage location, is 
considered the "western gateway" to the park. 
</P>
<P>
An appraisal of the land by the park authority is under way. 
</P>
<P>
Next to it, park officials hope to buy 86 acres behind the Big Bear shopping 
center on Via de la Valle, on the east side of I-5. The site was once 
envisioned as a private project called "Horse World." 
</P>
<P>
The mortgage on the property was held by a savings and loan that now is under 
the control of the federal Resolution Trust Corp. 
</P>
<P>
The park authority is in line to receive a $2-million grant from the state's 
Coastal Conservancy to buy the property, Coombs said. The property is valued at 
about $2 million, she said. 
</P>
<P>
But the park agency -- whose directors represent the cities of San Diego, 
Poway, Escondido, Del Mar and Solana Beach and the county of San Diego -- is 
hardly in position to start making cash offers for property up and down the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
The day-to-day operations of the park agency, including paying two full-time 
employees, part-time workers, consultants and appraisers, are funded through 
two sources. 
</P>
<P>
State legislation allocates a share of the off-track horse betting proceeds 
from the Del Mar Race Track, which this year amounted to about $93,000. The 
member cities and the county kick in an additional $97,000 or so among them, as 
their contributions to the regional park that will wind through their 
jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
But the big bucks -- the tens of millions of dollars ultimately needed for 
major land purchases -- just aren't there. 
</P>
<P>
The park received an immediate infusion of $10 million from Proposition 70, the 
statewide open-space and parklands bond measure approved in June, 1988. Of 
that, $700,000 went toward last week's purchase of the 89-acre wetlands 
property, which was valued at a relatively bargain-basement $2 million because 
the property could not be developed commercially. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of that purchase price -- $1.3 million -- was picked up by the city 
of San Diego, through its wetlands acquisition funds. 
</P>
<P>
The park agency also hopes to tap some of the $10 million in Proposition 70 
funds earmarked for the preservation of riparian areas -- and which will be 
awarded by the state's Wildlife Conservation Board -- and get some money set 
aside by state voters who approved the so-called mountain lion wildlife habitat 
bill in June. 
</P>
<P>
The park authority hopes to be awarded another $1 million or $2 million in 
Proposition 70 funds that are specified for "resource conservation areas." 
</P>
<P>
And it hopes to receive state funds allocated annually from federal payments to 
the state for off-shore leases, and from proceeds on the sale of personalized 
license plates. Such funds are typically "pork barreled" by state legislators 
annually for various pet open-space and other environmental projects. 
</P>
<P>
The park agency had hoped its most significant single source of revenue -- $15 
million in bonds to buy parkland -- would be approved by San Diego city voters 
in November. Instead, it failed by 2,000 votes, and the park agency hopes the 
measure will be put on the ballot again next November, and that voters will be 
in a better mood. 
</P>
<P>
So for now, much of the potential parkland remains on the park's wish list. 
</P>
<P>
Even without the purchases of major park pieces, the agency is moving ahead 
with other plans that may allow public use of the San Dieguito River Park 
within a year. 
</P>
<P>
Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* The Bureau of Land Management deeded property at the upper end of the San 
Pasqual Valley, alongside California 78 as it winds uphill to Ramona, to the 
city of San Diego. Officials now are planning hiking trails on that land, as 
well as staging areas along the highway where hikers can park their vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
* The city of San Diego is in the process of buying 70 acres between the San 
Pasqual Valley and Poway's Big Sky Ranch, to serve as a link for horse trails 
between the two parks. The property costs about $1 million, and the city is 
paying for it with its own share of Proposition 70 funds. 
</P>
<P>
* Within the San Pasqual Valley itself -- which is a San Diego city 
agricultural preserve -- businesses leasing property from the city are on 
notice that they will have to allow hikers and others to cross their property 
on park trails. 
</P>
<P>
* The area around Lake Hodges -- whose shoreline is owned by the city of San 
Diego's water utilities department -- is being planned for various park uses, 
including picnic areas, trails and two interpretive and cultural centers. One 
would showcase the historic Sykes Adobe as an old California farmhouse as it 
would have appeared 100 years ago, and another would display the Native 
American influence in the region -- both in a contemporary sense and how it 
dates back 9,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
And in respect for those who don't ride bicycles or horses or hike on foot, 
Coombs said one proposal calls for stagecoach rides to take visitors from the 
Sykes Adobe to Mule Hill, where the battle of San Pasqual was fought in 1846, 
and then to a private Thomas Jaeger Winery on the north side of the valley, 
where owners are planning a restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Coombs said the park offerings around Lake Hodges will be the first to be made 
available to the public, since that land already is in public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
On the western front, the park already had been awarded a $100,000 grant from 
the state's Coastal Conservancy to study whether the San Dieguito Lagoon can 
naturally be extended beneath I-5 easterly, filling now-private river bottom as 
a lagoon that would be impacted by natural tidal influences. 
</P>
<P>
If that is possible, she said, the would-be parkland would then be an obvious 
recipient of funds from developers and public agencies -- such as the Port of 
Long Beach -- which by law must off-set environmental damage it does to the 
coastline by contributing to coastal projects elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, private development plans continue along the parkland corridor, to 
the concern of park officials who hope they won't find parkland lost before 
they can get the money to buy it. 
</P>
<P>
Property owners in the Santa Fe Valley, between Rancho Santa Fe and Lake 
Hodges, slowly are preparing their own residential development plans, for 
instance. But Coombs is hopeful that before they progress too far, the county 
of San Diego will implement new overlay zoning laws specifically intended to 
mesh private development with the future park, so that if the land can't be set 
aside as parkland, at least private development will be compatible with 
whatever trail systems can be installed. 
</P>
<P>
Among the possible carrots being considered for extension to the Santa Fe 
Valley developers, she said, will be permission to "cluster" homes in greater 
density, in exchange for the dedication of private land for park use. 
</P>
<P>
In other areas, though, private development has already occurred without regard 
to the park, she said. She offers as an example new homes in a development on 
Rancho Santa Fe's east side. The development, on the north side of Del Dios 
Highway and within the park's so-called view shed, "are huge, with white stucco 
walls and red tile roofs, that just jump out at you." 
</P>
<P>
"Some projects," she lamented, "were approved before the park authority was 
established and before the city and county were able to adjust their own 
land-use guidelines. We hope that the new regulations that are being developed 
will guarantee that private development along the park will be more sensitive 
to the park."

PRIEST'S RECORDING OF CONFESSION VIOLATED PRIVACY, SUIT CHARGES; 
</P>
<P>
COURTS: A FORMER YOUTH MINISTER WHOSE THREE TRIALS FOR MOLESTATION ENDED IN 
HUNG JURIES WANTS THE TAPE TURNED OVER TO HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A former Burbank youth minister whose three trials on charges of molesting a 
teen-age boy ended in hung juries has sued an Episcopal priest who 
tape-recorded a confession allegedly concerning the sexual allegations. 
</P>
<P>
David Rickard, 40, former youth pastor -- a lay staff worker -- at St. Jude's 
Church in Burbank, says in the lawsuit that the church's rector, Father Michael 
T. Flynn, violated Rickard's privacy and the confidentiality of confession. 
</P>
<P>
The suit asks that the tape be turned over to Rickard of Sierra Madre or taken 
by the court. Also named in the suit, filed Nov. 28 in Burbank Superior Court, 
are St. Jude's and the Episcopal Diocese of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 6, Judge Thomas J. Murphy sealed the court record and ordered all those 
involved in the case not to talk about it. 
</P>
<P>
Confession is a church rite under which a person admits wrongdoing to a priest 
for the purpose of forgiveness. Under California law, a clergyman cannot be 
forced in court to reveal the contents of a confession, in the same way that 
the law protects conversations between doctors and patients or attorneys and 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard has denied engaging in a sexual relationship but admitted feelings of 
attraction for the youth. He said Flynn urged him to confess, then misconstrued 
his words as an admission he had sex with the youth. 
</P>
<P>
Flynn, 50, rector at St. Jude's for nine years, declined to comment. Canon 
Bruce MacPherson, a spokesman for the diocese, said he was unfamiliar with 
details of the case but that under Episcopalian practice a confession "would 
not be divulged." He said, however, that tape-recording a confession does not 
violate church policy. 
</P>
<P>
Rickard was tried in 1989 in Redding and in 1989 and 1990 in Pasadena Superior 
Court on 120 charges of oral copulation with a 15-year-old boy who was in 
Rickard's Bible study class. 
</P>
<P>
The youth, now 20 and married, spent time with Rickard in Sierra Madre and 
later, with his parents' permission, moved with Rickard to Northern California 
in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
The parents learned of the alleged sexual relationship in 1987 and notified 
authorities. Charges were dismissed this year in both sites after the third 
jury deadlocked in Pasadena in August. 
</P>
<P>
But after the Pasadena trial, and before Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert de Carteret 
had decided whether to try Rickard again or dismiss the charges, Flynn wrote de 
Carteret on Nov. 20, requesting that de Carteret spare the boy and his family 
the ordeal of a fourth trial. To support his plea, he revealed the existence of 
the taped confession, arguing that he could use it to control Rickard's future 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
In the letter, Flynn said the tape "was probably not admissible in a court of 
law, but it will be held secure for other use should Mr. Rickard's future 
behavior require its utilization." 
</P>
<P>
De Carteret said he did not try to obtain the tape as evidence because it is 
protected under California law. A week later, de Carteret decided not to try 
Rickard again and charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
But by filing a suit against Flynn in which the tape is an issue, de Carteret 
said Rickard may have legally waived his right to keep it private. And so he 
began reconsidering moving for another trial, the prosecutor said, until the 
judge imposed the gag order that blocks access to the tape. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Rodiger, vice chancellor of the diocese and an attorney, said the diocese 
and the bishop will probably have little role in the lawsuit because Episcopal 
churches are independently run. Each church elects its own clergy, Rodiger 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Rodiger said the lawsuit could center on the legal difference between a 
"confession" and a "conversation." 
</P>
<P>
A similar case about 10 years ago in Northern California made such a 
distinction, he said. A woman convicted of stealing church money sued her 
priest, who had reported the theft because he interpreted her admission to him 
as a conversation. She lost. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages. Rickard has said previously that he 
spent more than $90,000 defending himself.

WOMEN'S BOYCOTT OF ELLIS BOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though blacks have always decried racist representations of themselves in 
literature and film, and though Jews have always spoken out against 
anti-Semitism, the male editors of the Los Angeles Times have decided that when 
it comes to the sexist and violently misogynistic depictions of women in Bret 
Easton Ellis' "American Psycho," women should be silent lest they violate the 
rights of men to read and create texts and films that sexually degrade and 
dismember women. 
</P>
<P>
As evidenced by your editorial, The Times has decided that a man's right to 
propagate and consume sexist depictions of women is more important than a 
woman's or child's right to live without the fear of being sexually assaulted. 
One in six women and one in four little girls have been sexually assaulted. Yet 
The Times expects women to do nothing but allow the production, promotion and 
consumption of misogyny to continue and grow unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom of speech is an important right, but when it cost the lives of women 
and children, it is in direct contradiction with the basic values of our 
democracy. We recognize this conflict when we disallow child pornography and 
violent pornography. 
</P>
<P>
Democracy was never meant to be anybody's Hell. Our Founding Fathers sought to 
protect freedom of religion and political expression. We are not fools to 
believe that any of them would have continued "American Psycho." They could 
hardly have dreamed of such a work and would have relegated it to the rank of 
obscenity. 
</P>
<P>
Since we live in a democracy, we have the right to demand change. We can do 
this through boycotts and via the political process. The purpose of a democracy 
is to create a society in which people can live in peace and happiness. 
</P>
<P>
Texts like "American Psycho" create injustice and harm, and we have every right 
to oppose them, even to destroy them. Such is the reality and function of 
democracy; and it is right, because it creates the most happiness and peace for 
all, especially for women and children.

MOTHER, MISSING GIRL REUNITED FOR CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA RAPATTONI, UNITED PRESS INTERNATIONAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Los Angeles court interpreter was reunited for the holidays with her 
13-year-old daughter, eight years after the girl was allegedly kidnaped by her 
father from the woman's Burbank home. 
</P>
<P>
"I have not celebrated Christmas since she left," Rosemary Levi said, breaking 
into tears as she recounted the loss of her daughter, Monica Judith Bonilla. "I 
have not celebrated Mother's Day since she left." 
</P>
<P>
Monica was 5 when her father, Guillermo Bonilla, allegedly took her from Levi's 
Burbank residence on Sept. 22, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
They were reunited Monday after a television viewer alerted authorities that he 
had seen a picture of a kidnaped girl on the program "America's Most Wanted" 
whom he believed to be Monica. 
</P>
<P>
He was mistaken. The report was about another girl resembling Monica. But the 
tip led authorities to the girl and her father on Point Roberts, a small island 
near the U.S.-Canadian border in Washington state, the Los Angeles district 
attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Monica had been given another name and was told her mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
Bonilla, 43, was being held in Bellingham, Wash., awaiting extradition and 
arraignment Wednesday in Los Angeles on a charge of parental child abduction, 
the district attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
Since the kidnaping, Levi remarried and had a son, now 6. 
</P>
<P>
She said she has spent $20,000 hiring detectives to try to find her daughter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the happiest mother in the world," Levi said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"God has sent back my daughter. She was found by accident, but I don't believe 
in accidents," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Levi has moved from Burbank to "somewhere in the Los Angeles area," the 
district attorney's office said, declining to reveal a more specific location 
for the sake of security. 
</P>
<P>
"I love my family," Monica told a news conference, after meeting her half 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got a little brother. He's sweet. I was happy before, and I am still 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
Asked what she wanted for Christmas, Monica said, "I'd like an M.C. Hammer 
tape." Then, hugging her mother and half brother, she said, "And I already got 
these guys."

If you're one of those Americans who went to bed one night as a butcher, baker 
or candlestick-maker and woke up a week later to find yourself back in uniform 
staring across the Arabian sands at Saddam Hussein's army, the last thing you 
ought to have to worry about is unpaid parking tickets or broken apartment 
leases back home. 
</P>
<P>
Or at least you won't if Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Gregory C. O'Brien's 
has his way. 
</P>
<P>
O'Brien is a a legal idealist who believes that "most lawyers retain a strong 
belief in public service." 
</P>
<P>
It is that belief that O'Brien hopes to tap in his new campaign to provide free 
or low- cost legal services to military reservists called to active duty for 
service in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
Working after hours out of his Pomona chambers, O'Brien is contacting bar 
associations across the country and asking them to distribute a form on which 
their members can list their qualifications and the number of cases they are 
willing to handle for reservists on a pro bono, reduced-fee or deferred-payment 
basis. 
</P>
<P>
As the completed forms are returned to him, O'Brien will compile them into a 
computerized list, which he will turn over to the judge advocate's office. 
</P>
<P>
His hope is that the judge advocate will make the list available to military 
personnel when civil or criminal legal problems arise. 
</P>
<P>
It's better than a good idea, it's a practical one. 
</P>
<P>
In this case, O'Brien's judicial remedy is appropriate not only to the spirit 
of the season, but also to the challenge of the occasion.

WE NEED A POLICY, NOT A FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With disturbing regularity, novels and textbooks are yanked from school 
classrooms across the nation, because someone somewhere finds them 
objectionable. Yet a recent survey found that nearly one-quarter of the school 
districts in California have no formal policies to deal with such objections. 
</P>
<P>
Attacks upon great literature for young adults and children are nothing new -- 
from "Catcher in the Rye" to "Little Red Riding Hood." The advocacy group 
People for the American Way documented 244 book challenges in the 1989-90 
school year, and California accounted for almost one-third of those. 
Unfortunately, it's such fertile ground for controversy that each school 
district in the state now needs to have a clear and well-defined policy of how 
to handle, (and fend off most) objections to school reading materials. 
</P>
<P>
A nonchalant attitude about preserving precious freedoms too often creates an 
atmosphere that encourages censorship. The most pressing danger is that school 
officials will simply remove a book from a library or a class curriculum rather 
than debate its merits. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of formal policies likely results in "preemptive" censorship, said 
Louise Adler, an education professor at Cal State Fullerton who conducted the 
recent survey. "It means that either a district will not give someone a fair 
hearing, or someone will just remove a text without really considering what 
should be done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
An example of such a "preemptive strike" was cited in People for the American 
Way's annual censorship report. A school official in La Puente requested that 
Edgar Allan Poe's "The Black Cat" be removed from a ninth-grade classroom, 
because the official was afraid that someone would object to a picture of a 
hanging cat that accompanied the famous short story. So in a move to avoid 
controversy, the book was removed. 
</P>
<P>
Such a chilling incident is all the more reason why every school district 
should have clear procedures for logging objections to school reading 
materials. That way, protesters can be heard -- but their angry voices alone 
will not be enough to cower supporters of the intellectual freedom on which 
this nation was built.

DON'T BLAME COASTAL COMMISSION; 
</P>
<P>
IT HAD TO BLOW THE WHISTLE ON HOPE DEAL; THE LAW MADE IT DO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For a time, the Santa Monica Mountains stood to get 5,700 new acres of parkland 
through a complicated property swap among developers, a state agency and Bob 
Hope. It still could happen, but the California Coastal Commission has rightly 
ruled that the law would have to be broken, not just bent, to accommodate the 
deal in its original form. 
</P>
<P>
The commission rejected a proposal in mid-December to build 26 luxury houses in 
Malibu's Corral Canyon. That would have been the triggering deal for a plan 
under which Hope could have developed his Jordan Ranch property in Ventura 
County and then deeded the new park property to the Santa Mountain Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
Its decision has led to some grumbling over the practice of coastal 
parochialism, protecting the beach at the expense of the forest. In fact, the 
commission had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
The development would have required remodeling the canyon itself. To make way 
for the houses, bulldozers would have graded 2.2 million cubic yards of earth, 
covering over what an advisory group agreed was an "environmentally sensitive 
habitat." The 1976 law under which the commission operates specifically shields 
such areas from any disturbance, let alone being buried alive, except when it 
cannot be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
Another part of the law directs the commission to minimize the alteration of 
"land form" when it issues permits for development in the coastal zone. There 
was nothing minimal about the Corral Canyon proposal. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, it seemed clear, at least to its staff, that even if the commission 
approved the canyon development, the rest of the swap could fall apart. Malibu 
would be stuck with a precedent that allowed 84,000 cubic yards of dirt to be 
moved per house instead of the existing average 5,000 yards, and there would 
not be a single new acre of parkland. 
</P>
<P>
The lawyers will get together after the holidays to try to patch the swap back 
together. The deal surely can work without anyone's losing a bundle. The 
lawyers should focus on how, not whether.

<TEXT>
<P>
Two gunmen approached a couple in a car parked in Mission Hills early Christmas 
Day, shot the man to death and raped his woman companion, the woman told Los 
Angeles police. 
</P>
<P>
A passerby noticed the body of Elmer Rudy Alvarado, 26, of Highland Park 
slumped in the front seat of a car on Tupper Street near Lemona Avenue on 
Tuesday morning, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"He had been shot at least once in the upper portion of his body," Officer 
Marlene Johnson said.

<TEXT>
<P>
A woman killed when her car struck a utility pole in Van Nuys has been 
identified as Martha Nunez, 53, of North Hollywood, Los Angeles police reported 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Nunez may have been having car problems when her auto ran a red light Monday on 
Sepulveda Boulevard at Victory Boulevard and sideswiped another car before 
crashing, Officer Leona Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
"Witnesses said she was going about 55 or 60 miles per hour through the 
intersection . . . waving her hands and honking her horn like she was trying to 
warn people," Thomas said. "We don't know for sure what happened, yet, but it's 
possible that her accelerator was stuck."

ARIZONA GETS NOTHING FROM SYRACUSE;

<P>
ALOHA: WILDCATS ARE SHUT OUT FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 1971, 28-0.

<P>
The Aloha Bowl couldn't have been better for Syracuse or worse for Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen didn't allow Arizona inside their 28-yard line in Tuesday's Aloha 
Bowl, winning, 28-0. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first time the Wildcats have been shut out in 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not one of the better Christmases I've had," Arizona Coach Dick Tomey 
said. "It was a terrible performance." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona (7-5) had scored in 214 consecutive games since a 31-0 loss to Arizona 
State on Nov. 27, 1971. It was the second-longest scoring streak in the nation 
behind UCLA's 227 in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Marvin Graves passed for two touchdowns and rushed for two more for the 
Orangemen (7-4-2), who had lost to Miami, 33-7, in their final regular-season 
game. 
</P>
<P>
"Coming out of the loss to Miami, I think a lot of us were embarrassed, so we 
wanted to prove something," Graves said. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse kept almost constant pressure on Arizona quarterbacks Ronald Veal and 
George Malauulu, sacking them four times, and the Wildcats were unable to 
sustain any drives. 
</P>
<P>
"Momentum-wise, they shut the door on us," Tomey said. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought our guys played their best game of the year," Syracuse Coach Dick 
MacPherson said. "We had a pretty good defensive game plan." 
</P>
<P>
Graves, a redshirt freshman who was voted most valuable player for the 
Orangemen, completed 10 of 19 passes for 145 yards and was intercepted once. He 
rushed 11 times for 45 yards. 
</P>
<P>
He scored on a five-yard quarterback draw on Syracuse's first possession. In 
the second quarter, he found a wide-open Terry Richardson for a 47-yard 
touchdown pass play as Syracuse took a 14-0 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
It was anything but an offensive showcase on a cool, rainy day, but the 
Orangemen managed some long drives and 352 yards of offense. Syracuse scored on 
three long drives and capitalized on a defensive breakdown by the Wildcats for 
their other touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Burden, who intercepted two passes, was chosen as Arizona's MVP. 
</P>
<P>
Arizona took a field-position advantage in the third quarter after Gary Coston 
faked a 50-yard field goal and punted to the Syracuse one-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats got the ball back and moved to the Orangemen's 41 before punting. 
They pushed to the 35-yard line before the third quarter ended, but Kevin 
Mitchell sacked Malauulu for a loss of eight yards and the Wildcats punted 
again. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse put it out of reach with a 90-yard touchdown drive, capped by six-yard 
pass from Graves to tight end Chris Gedney, who bulled into the end zone with 
10:34 left. 
</P>
<P>
Graves scored the final touchdown on a seven-yard quarterback draw with 3:47 
left. 
</P>
<P>
While Graves was the offensive spark in the first half, Arizona helped, 
stalling twice on fourth down inside Syracuse territory. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen came out strong, moving 66 yards in 13 plays for a 7-0 lead. 
Running back David Walker converted on fourth and inches and Graves found wide 
receiver Rob Carpenter on third and six to sustain the drive. 
</P>
<P>
On third and three at the Arizona five, Graves stepped back and dashed into the 
end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
The Wildcats threatened early in the second quarter, driving to the Syracuse 
30. Arizona went for it on fourth and eight, but Greg Walker broke up Veal's 
pass intended for Richard Griffith.

ILLUMINATING TWO UNTIDY CONSTELLATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMENTARY: 'THE FAUVE LANDSCAPE' AND 'THE INDEPENDENT GROUP' TACKLE IMPORTANT 
TRANSITIONAL MOMENTS IN 20TH-CENTURY ART. 
</P>

<P>
It's common to think of the history of art as a lively sequence of discrete 
"major monuments." These masterworks, produced through the labor of individual 
artistic genius, rank as cultural high points that loom above the broad 
lowlands of mundane historical events. Or, in the concise dialect of an 
undergraduate's introductory art history course, the lineup spans "The Pyramids 
to Pollock." 
</P>
<P>
As history is in fact much messier than that, the untidy ebbs and flows of 
cultural life are important to remember. Individual artistic genius certainly 
plays its part; but, as much as genius might be inborn, it is also constructed 
by a constellation of events. Museum shows that try to illuminate such 
constellations, which often constitute transitional phases for art, are 
therefore of particular note. 
</P>
<P>
Such is the case with two sizable and very different shows in Los Angeles. "The 
Fauve Landscape: Matisse, Derain, Braque and Their Circle, 1904-1908," at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art (through Sunday), and "The Independent Group: 
Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics of Plenty," at the Museum of Contemporary 
Art's Temporary Contemporary in Little Tokyo (through Jan. 13), tackle two 
important moments of transition in 20th-Century art. Even if most of the work 
in these two exhibitions leaves something to be desired, both are notable. 
</P>
<P>
Fauve painting and the art of the Independent Group opened important 
possibilities for subsequent generations of artists, or for the later work 
certain participating artists were themselves to produce. If "The Independent 
Group" is finally the more satisfying of the two, it is hardly because any wild 
claim can be made that Magda Cordell, Richard Hamilton, Eduardo Paolozzi and 
the rest are more accomplished artists in our own time than were Henri Matisse, 
Andre Derain or Georges Braque in theirs. It is because the show of British art 
has a clear-eyed grasp of the achievement under scrutiny, while the show of 
Fauve painting makes more of its particular subject than finally is warranted. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fauve Landscape" is immense. More than 170 paintings, installed in the 
galleries geographically and chronologically, follow the work of 10 artists who 
shared an affinity for exuberant color not tied to a faithful description of 
nature. These artists stood at a complex crossroads. They built upon the 
earlier achievements of the Impressionists, Post-Impressionists, Symbolists and 
other artists of the late 19th Century and their efforts opened the way for the 
Expressionist, Cubist and individual styles that would mark the true beginnings 
of a 20th-Century art. 
</P>
<P>
Although the artists knew one another, and sometimes painted side by side, it 
is a mistake to think of the Fauves as a cohesive group or "movement," complete 
with clearly defined aims and aspirations. Simply put, they pried color loose 
from any conventional moorings that remained for art, and they did so for a 
variety of purposes. Their collective name (which means "the wild beasts") was 
arrived at serendipitously, when a critic lumped together the work of several 
artists in a commentary on a 1905 exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fauve Landscape" begins with paintings made the year prior to that show, 
and it ends a scant four years later; by then, even a strained cohesiveness 
cannot be detected among most of the painters. The brevity of the Fauve period, 
which really burned brightest for little more than two years, is conspicuously 
important. The concentrated moment speaks of an intensity and excitement that 
could not be expected to last. Furthermore, it suggests an exuberance befitting 
the youth of many of the artists. 
</P>
<P>
Most were not yet 30 in 1905. Matisse, at 36, was the "grand old man" of Fauve 
painting, but the two most important of the remaining artists were the youngest 
of the bunch -- Braque at 23, Derain at 25. For Derain, especially, the matter 
of age is significant. He had known Matisse since his teens. Painting side by 
side with him in Collioure, a fishing village in the south of France, the 
challenge of an informal master-apprentice relationship was inevitable. 
Liberated by the example of the older artist, Derain pushed himself to the 
limit. 
</P>
<P>
Derain's career as an invigorating painter was truly meteoric. It flashed into 
view in 1905 and by the end of 1907 was decisively over. In room after room at 
LACMA, where by far the largest share of the sprawling exhibition chronicles 
the often dreary paintings of such lesser lights as Othon Friesz, Albert 
Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck and the rest, Derain's canvases repeatedly 
surprise. He is not, by any means, the painter that Matisse was, nor did he 
possess the early promise that Braque was to build upon in his Cubist years. 
Yet, especially in paintings executed in the golden light of L'Estaque, a port 
town near Marseilles, Derain repeatedly steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
What brought Derain's painting crashing to the ground? It's difficult to say 
for sure. But, judging from the chunky (and clunky) paintings in the show's 
final room, the sudden death of Paul Cezanne in the fall of 1906 and the 
memorial exhibition to him mounted in Paris the following spring were likely 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the memorial show on French painting is well known. What Matisse 
was to color, Cezanne had been to form. He had wanted, as the famous aphorism 
goes, to make of his art "something solid, like the museums." Cezanne's death, 
and the elevation of his art into the pantheon, made committed confrontation 
with his accomplishments a necessity. For Derain, the urge to monumentalize the 
otherwise fleeting exuberance of his pastoral landscapes was strong. But when 
he tried to transform his wide-open, youthful style into something solid and 
"important," it deflated fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fauve Landscape" is an important show (the catalogue's minutely detailed 
chronology, assembled by curator Judi Freeman, is a remarkable contribution in 
itself). But it disappoints, too. The decision to focus on landscape painting, 
at the expense of figure studies and still-lifes, skews the presentation in 
puzzling ways. We now have a full accounting of who painted what, when, where 
and with whom. Yet no reason is persuasively offered to believe that the direct 
encounter with the French landscape, often by small groups of artists, had more 
to do with Fauve ideals than working alone in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a show with an exceedingly odd demeanor. It presents a definitive 
comparison of the paintings of a few major, but of mostly minor, artists 
working with just one aspect of a larger transitional moment, whose most 
abundant fruits came later. The show feels misshapen. 
</P>
<P>
By sharp contrast, "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics 
of Plenty" presents its assembly of minor artists working in a transitional 
moment in ways that mingle insight with balance. (The show could use a more 
graceful installation, but that's another matter.) The Independent Group -- a 
kind of artistic think tank of 15 painters, sculptors, photographers, 
designers, architects and writers -- was as short-lived as the Fauves, 
brainstorming and mounting exhibitions between 1952 and '55. But one never 
senses that curator Jacquelynn Bass, director of the University Art Museum at 
Berkeley, where the show travels next, is making outsize claims for the art. By 
featuring reconstructions of parts of exhibitions organized by the Independent 
Group, the show exudes a documentary feel. It says, simply, "This is what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the presentation benefits enormously from an element of 
unfamiliarity. Because the Independent Group included prominent writers -- 
especially the architecture critic Reyner Banham and the art critic Lawrence 
Alloway -- the so-called "proto-Pop" art produced in London in the 1950s is a 
standard part of the contemporary literature, although rarely seen in the 
flesh. Indeed, just a single image from the period comes readily to mind: 
Richard Hamilton's famous small collage of gross suburban consumerism, "Just 
what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?" 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this 1956 collage is not in the exhibition (a color photograph 
fills in for the absent piece, which currently hangs at New York's Museum of 
Modern Art in the egregious "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture"). 
What will be found at MOCA, however, is a whole wall filled with like-minded 
collages by Eduardo Paolozzi, the Scottish-born son of Italian immigrants. Many 
pre-date the Hamilton by at least a half-dozen years. With their evident debt 
to the earlier classic collages made from ticket stubs and such by Kurt 
Schwitters, Paolozzi's works provide eye-opening context for the one famous 
image from the period. 
</P>
<P>
"The Independent Group" is in fact a show very much about context, and about 
artists who sensed a radical shift occurring in postwar life. They tried, 
albeit without much immediate success, to fashion a visual language with which 
to come to terms with the change. 
</P>
<P>
Great Britain, like the Continent, was staggering under the rebuilding effort 
that followed the horrible devastation of World War II. In the process of 
reconstruction, both sides of the Channel were being "invaded" -- not by bombs 
or troops, but by products and images from the burgeoning United States. In 
contrast to the rest of Europe, Britain shared a common language with its 
all-American colonizer. And in an exploration of a social revolution whose 
consumerist values were borne by images created in magazines, movies, records, 
advertising and other narrative mediums of mass culture, this was no small 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Within the hidebound class-structure of Britain, mandarins did not take kindly 
to the sudden inundation of uncontrollable foreign trash. Of course, this was 
precisely the quality the receptive artists of the Independent Group recognized 
as holding the capacity for a certain liberation. Making "high art" from the 
raucous artifacts of "popular culture" explains the prominence in the show of 
cut-and-paste collage. Furthermore, it suggests how a group of mostly 
working-class artists meant to have a say in reshaping a new England. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, an insurmountable contradiction to the process of 
transforming ostensible kitsch into art, by making paintings and sculptures 
from Intimate Confessions magazines and concrete construction blocks. Whether 
"elevating" artifacts of popular culture to the level of high art, or "dragging 
down" high art to the level of popular culture, a traditional concept of 
hierarchy remained the operating principle. The unresolved dilemma for the 
artists of the Independent Group was how to do more than merely tinker with 
traditional categories. 
</P>
<P>
One productive approach lay in regarding the whole modern pile-up of images, 
high or low, as if cultural artifacts of a mysterious civilization. The 
business of the artist was thus akin to being an archeologist of contemporary 
life. The artist who, more than any other, was able to harness this 
archeological motif to compelling, if modest, effect was the sculptor William 
Turnbull. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull's "Head 2" (1955) is easily the standout in the show. A small, 
scarified, oval lump of blackened bronze lying on its side, "Head 2" contains 
within it decisive echoes of the sculptural perfection of Brancusi; yet, this 
sleek idealization is wedded to both the ancient geology and the working-class 
pressures of the coal yard. A scant eight inches long, and begging to be 
cradled in the hands, the sweet, compact little oval form is part life-bearing 
egg, part grisly hand-grenade. 
</P>
<P>
Transitional phases may not necessarily result in the immediate production of 
major monuments of art. But a sculpture like this one is really quite enough.

Derain's career as an invigorating painter was truly meteoric. It flashed into 
view in 1905 and by the end of 1907 was decisively over. In room after room at 
LACMA, where by far the largest share of the sprawling exhibition chronicles 
the often dreary paintings of such lesser lights as Othon Friesz, Albert 
Marquet, Maurice de Vlaminck and the rest, Derain's canvases repeatedly 
surprise. He is not, by any means, the painter that Matisse was, nor did he 
possess the early promise that Braque was to build upon in his Cubist years. 
Yet, especially in paintings executed in the golden light of L'Estaque, a port 
town near Marseilles, Derain repeatedly steals the show. 
</P>
<P>
What brought Derain's painting crashing to the ground? It's difficult to say 
for sure. But, judging from the chunky (and clunky) paintings in the show's 
final room, the sudden death of Paul Cezanne in the fall of 1906 and the 
memorial exhibition to him mounted in Paris the following spring were likely 
contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The effect of the memorial show on French painting is well known. What Matisse 
was to color, Cezanne had been to form. He had wanted, as the famous aphorism 
goes, to make of his art "something solid, like the museums." Cezanne's death, 
and the elevation of his art into the pantheon, made committed confrontation 
with his accomplishments a necessity. For Derain, the urge to monumentalize the 
otherwise fleeting exuberance of his pastoral landscapes was strong. But when 
he tried to transform his wide-open, youthful style into something solid and 
"important," it deflated fast. 
</P>
<P>
"The Fauve Landscape" is an important show (the catalogue's minutely detailed 
chronology, assembled by curator Judi Freeman, is a remarkable contribution in 
itself). But it disappoints, too. The decision to focus on landscape painting, 
at the expense of figure studies and still-lifes, skews the presentation in 
puzzling ways. We now have a full accounting of who painted what, when, where 
and with whom. Yet no reason is persuasively offered to believe that the direct 
encounter with the French landscape, often by small groups of artists, had more 
to do with Fauve ideals than working alone in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
The result is a show with an exceedingly odd demeanor. It presents a definitive 
comparison of the paintings of a few major, but of mostly minor, artists 
working with just one aspect of a larger transitional moment, whose most 
abundant fruits came later. The show feels misshapen. 
</P>
<P>
By sharp contrast, "The Independent Group: Postwar Britain and the Aesthetics 
of Plenty" presents its assembly of minor artists working in a transitional 
moment in ways that mingle insight with balance. (The show could use a more 
graceful installation, but that's another matter.) The Independent Group -- a 
kind of artistic think tank of 15 painters, sculptors, photographers, 
designers, architects and writers -- was as short-lived as the Fauves, 
brainstorming and mounting exhibitions between 1952 and '55. But one never 
senses that curator Jacquelynn Bass, director of the University Art Museum at 
Berkeley, where the show travels next, is making outsize claims for the art. By 
featuring reconstructions of parts of exhibitions organized by the Independent 
Group, the show exudes a documentary feel. It says, simply, "This is what 
happened." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, the presentation benefits enormously from an element of 
unfamiliarity. Because the Independent Group included prominent writers -- 
especially the architecture critic Reyner Banham and the art critic Lawrence 
Alloway -- the so-called "proto-Pop" art produced in London in the 1950s is a 
standard part of the contemporary literature, although rarely seen in the 
flesh. Indeed, just a single image from the period comes readily to mind: 
Richard Hamilton's famous small collage of gross suburban consumerism, "Just 
what is it that makes today's homes so different, so appealing?" 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this 1956 collage is not in the exhibition (a color photograph 
fills in for the absent piece, which currently hangs at New York's Museum of 
Modern Art in the egregious "High &amp; Low: Modern Art and Popular Culture"). 
What will be found at MOCA, however, is a whole wall filled with like-minded 
collages by Eduardo Paolozzi, the Scottish-born son of Italian immigrants. Many 
pre-date the Hamilton by at least a half-dozen years. With their evident debt 
to the earlier classic collages made from ticket stubs and such by Kurt 
Schwitters, Paolozzi's works provide eye-opening context for the one famous 
image from the period. 
</P>
<P>
"The Independent Group" is in fact a show very much about context, and about 
artists who sensed a radical shift occurring in postwar life. They tried, 
albeit without much immediate success, to fashion a visual language with which 
to come to terms with the change. 
</P>
<P>
Great Britain, like the Continent, was staggering under the rebuilding effort 
that followed the horrible devastation of World War II. In the process of 
reconstruction, both sides of the Channel were being "invaded" -- not by bombs 
or troops, but by products and images from the burgeoning United States. In 
contrast to the rest of Europe, Britain shared a common language with its 
all-American colonizer. And in an exploration of a social revolution whose 
consumerist values were borne by images created in magazines, movies, records, 
advertising and other narrative mediums of mass culture, this was no small 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Within the hidebound class-structure of Britain, mandarins did not take kindly 
to the sudden inundation of uncontrollable foreign trash. Of course, this was 
precisely the quality the receptive artists of the Independent Group recognized 
as holding the capacity for a certain liberation. Making "high art" from the 
raucous artifacts of "popular culture" explains the prominence in the show of 
cut-and-paste collage. Furthermore, it suggests how a group of mostly 
working-class artists meant to have a say in reshaping a new England. 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, an insurmountable contradiction to the process of 
transforming ostensible kitsch into art, by making paintings and sculptures 
from Intimate Confessions magazines and concrete construction blocks. Whether 
"elevating" artifacts of popular culture to the level of high art, or "dragging 
down" high art to the level of popular culture, a traditional concept of 
hierarchy remained the operating principle. The unresolved dilemma for the 
artists of the Independent Group was how to do more than merely tinker with 
traditional categories. 
</P>
<P>
One productive approach lay in regarding the whole modern pile-up of images, 
high or low, as if cultural artifacts of a mysterious civilization. The 
business of the artist was thus akin to being an archeologist of contemporary 
life. The artist who, more than any other, was able to harness this 
archeological motif to compelling, if modest, effect was the sculptor William 
Turnbull. 
</P>
<P>
Turnbull's "Head 2" (1955) is easily the standout in the show. A small, 
scarified, oval lump of blackened bronze lying on its side, "Head 2" contains 
within it decisive echoes of the sculptural perfection of Brancusi; yet, this 
sleek idealization is wedded to both the ancient geology and the working-class 
pressures of the coal yard. A scant eight inches long, and begging to be 
cradled in the hands, the sweet, compact little oval form is part life-bearing 
egg, part grisly hand-grenade. 
</P>
<P>
Transitional phases may not necessarily result in the immediate production of 
major monuments of art. But a sculpture like this one is really quite enough.

Casting Change: Ron Silver is out and his understudy, Tom McGowan, is, at least 
for the moment, the new star of "La Bete," a Broadway-bound comedy that opens 
today at the Wilbur Theater in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Springer, a spokesman for the show, called Silver's departure "amicable," 
saying that the actor's withdrawal was due to "irreconcilable interpretive 
differences." Whether McGowan will have the role when the play opens on Jan. 31 
at the Eugene O'Neill Theater in New York is not certain. The play, written by 
David Hirson and directed by Richard Jones, takes place on the 17th-Century 
estate of a French prince, whose court is disrupted by a manic troubadour. The 
producers are Stuart Ostrow and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT : POP MUSICDON'T BE BASHFUL; THE CALL IS OUT FOR ALL STUPID 
SONGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
Aspiring songwriters, take note: Here's a chance to make a name for yourselves 
in the music industry and, at the same time, give your funny bones a good 
workout. 
</P>
<P>
"The Stupid Song Contest" is the brainchild of three veteran San Diego 
tunesmiths: Peter Dubow, a keyboardist who has played with Blonde Bruce Band; 
Robert Savery, who plays with the traditional country band the Savery Brothers, 
and a third party who asked to remain anonymous. (He's written some really big 
songs for some really big stars and, I'm told, doesn't want anyone to know he's 
involved in something so frivolous.) 
</P>
<P>
Here's how it works: Send a cassette and a lyric sheet of your stupid song, 
along with a check for $10, to The Stupid Song Contest, 270 North Canon Drive, 
Suite 9000, Beverly Hills, 90210. The deadline is March 31. Winning entries 
will appear on a nationally distributed compilation album, appropriately titled 
"The Stupid Song Contest Album." 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of contests for serious songs, but all songwriters have 
stupid songs just lying around with no place to send them," Dubow said. "And 
now, thanks to our contest, there is a place for stupid songs to go. It was 
something we felt needed doing, something we wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
And what constitutes a stupid song? 
</P>
<P>
"We're not looking for unintentionally stupid songs by people like Neil Diamond 
or Madonna, but intentionally stupid songs, like the novelty songs on "Dr. 
Demento," Dubow said. "People around town might know David Bradley's "Shut Up 
and Get Me a Beer," stuff like that. Songs that are just, well, stupid." 
</P>
<P>
The only caveats: no vulgarity and no parodies of existing songs. "Vulgarity is 
just too easy, too often done," Dubow said. "And, with the no parodies rule, we 
don't want to have problems with copyright infringements -- and besides, Weird 
Al Yankovic sort of has that territory covered." 
</P>
<P>
The Stupid Song Contest is being advertised in national songwriters magazines 
as well as regional publications like the L.A. Weekly and Nashville's Song 
Talk. Posters and flyers are being distributed to music stores and nightclubs 
in San Diego, Los Angeles, Nashville and Austin, Tex., four cities in which 
Dubow, Savery and their unnamed co-conspirator have music-biz connections. 
</P>
<P>
"We're hoping to place the album with some national label like Rhino Records; 
that would be the logical choice," Dubow said. "If not, we're going to put it 
out ourselves, any way we have to. 
</P>
<P>
"We're confident that there are plenty of stupid songs out there to generate 
legitimate interest, and that there are enough people who want to hear these 
stupid songs to make this project worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
If your idea of a hip way to spend New Year's Eve involves listening to live 
music, here are some suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
* The Beat Farmers, who recorded their "Loud and Plowed and . . . LIVE!!" album 
at the Bacchanal last New Year's Eve, will be at the Kearny Mesa nightclub this 
New Year's Eve as well. They will ring in 1991 along with two other promising 
local bands, Comanche Moon and the Travelin' Salesmen. 
</P>
<P>
* Another fine San Diego roots-rock band, the Paladins, will be at the Belly Up 
Tavern in Solana Beach. The trio has long been known for its invigorating live 
shows, and because this is only its second hometown appearance in as many 
months, expect it to really tear the place apart with its ferocious 
rockabilly-r&amp;b hybrid. 
</P>
<P>
The folks at Belly Up have also put together a package deal that includes a $50 
gift certificate for dinner at the Boathouse Restaurant, admission for two to 
the concert, a night at the Radisson Inn Encinitas, and transportation to and 
from the club. The cost per couple is $180. 
</P>
<P>
* Bobby Vinton, the sentimental pop crooner whose 30-some Top 40 hits include 
"Roses Are Red (My Love)," "Blue on Blue," "Blue Velvet," "Mr. Lonely" and "I 
Love How You Love Me," will headline the Hotel del Coronado's annual New Year's 
Eve bash in the hotel's Grand Ballroom. Joining him will be the Bill Green 
Orchestra, featuring vocalist Shirley Saunders, and Bart Hazlett and the Dixie 
Hasslers. 
</P>
<P>
Again, there's a package deal, albeit a considerably more pricey one: Dinner, 
tickets to the show, a night at the Hotel Del and champagne brunch the next 
day, for $545 per couple ($350 for dinner and the show only). 
</P>
<P>
* Owners of the Pink Panther, the trendy hangout for post-punk types that's 
scheduled to close for good Saturday night, are throwing a huge New Year's Eve 
party at the Ramada Hotel downtown. We're talking three ballrooms, three 
levels, five bars. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles funkmeisters Dino Lee and His Luv Johnson, featuring the Oingo 
Boingo horn section, will perform in the Thunderdome Concert Arena, along with 
San Diego's Loose Barbaric Love Fish. Deejays Kelleigh Reed and George Shea 
will play the latest hip-hop, house and funk dance tunes in the Nonstop 
Industrial Dance Zone. And the Hoods, another local group featuring former 
members of the Tell-Tale Hearts and the Trebels, will play vintage r&amp;b, ala 
the Yardbirds and early Stones, in the Fab Lava Lounge. 
</P>
<P>
LINER NOTES: Rhino Records has released a promotional CD to stir up press 
interest in Buddy Blue's upcoming solo album, "Guttersnipes 'n' Zealots," due 
out in February. The CD includes an interview and four songs from the new 
album. It's being sent to rock critics and radio stations all over the country. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Mojo Nixon has a new backup band, the Toadlickers. Three of the four members 
were formerly with the Neptunes, which for several years was one of the top 
roots-rock bands in Austin, Tex. The local looney tunesmith and his new 
colleagues just wrapped up a two-month U.S. tour with a Dec. 13 appearance at 
the Belly Up Tavern. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago this month, "Angel Baby" by Rosie and the Originals, the first 
San Diego rock band to have a national hit, entered Billboard's Hot 100 singles 
chart. The tune eventually peaked at No. 5. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Best concert bets for the coming week: Blues Deluxe, featuring Southside 
Johnny, Doug Hamblin, Marc Jordan, Rick Slosser and Dave Hayes, tonight at the 
Belly Up Tavern; Mary's Danish, Thursday at the Belly Up Tavern; Beat Farmers, 
Friday and Monday at the Bacchanal in Kearny Mesa; Bonedaddys with Mango Bang, 
Friday at the Belly Up Tavern; Dread Zeppelin with Lock Up, Saturday at the 
Bacchanal; Poison with Warrant, Sunday at San Diego Sports Arena; Eddie Money 
with the Down Beat, Sunday at the Bacchanal; and Bhundu Boys, Sunday at the 
Belly Up Tavern.

AN UNEVEN CELEBRATION OF ANIMATED SHORT FILMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SOLOMON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Although animation is enjoying an unprecedented boom in the United States, "The 
Third Animation Celebration," a collection of international shorts opening 
today at selected theaters, suggests that the most interesting and imaginative 
personal films are being produced in Europe. These serious, intensely 
individual works offer alternative visions of what animation can be. 
</P>
<P>
The haunting "Darkness, Light, Darkness" (Czechoslovakia), a stop-motion film 
by Jan Svankmajer, presents a bitter metaphor for the new political freedom in 
Eastern Europe. A pair of exquisitely sculpted clay hands laboriously assemble 
a human body, but when the newly created man awakens, he discovers he's 
imprisoned in a tiny room, like Alice in the White Rabbit's house. 
</P>
<P>
Overtones of political satire add zest to "Welcome" (Soviet Union), Alexei 
Karaev's adaptation of the Dr. Seuss story "Thidwick the Big- Hearted Moose." 
Various animals, including a family of squirrels and a small bear, take up 
residence in the amiable Thidwick's antlers; the animals begin as guests, but 
soon demand the right to decide where their host can and can't go. Karaev gives 
this handsome paint-on-glass film a gentle ending that lacks the ironic bite of 
the original children's book. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lord's "War Story" (Great Britain) satirizes the current nostalgia for 
World War II. Subtle clay animation mirrors the exaggerations of a doddering 
old gent's reminiscences about life in London during the Blitz, including a 
night spent "in the coal bin with the missus, her mum and the dog." 
</P>
<P>
George Griffin pokes fun at the constantly changing whims of ad agency staffs 
in "New Fangled" (United States), an agreeable, if light, work from one of 
America's foremost independent animators. Randy Bauer spoofs John Lasseter's 
popular "Luxo Jr." in "Lava Jr." (United States), a skillful parody using 
computer animation of a '60s Lava Light. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the American films approach this level of imagination and skill. Bill 
Plympton's "The Wiseman" repeats the scribbly drawings and metamorphic 
animation he's used since "Your Face" (1987), although the style has lost its 
novelty. John Kricfalusi tries much too hard to evoke the mayhem of the classic 
Tex Avery shorts in "Ren Hoek and Stimpy in 'Big House Blues,' " a frenetic 
work that wears out its welcome long before 8 1/2 minutes have elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
The clips of "Dr. N!godatu", made by the Klasky-Csupo studio for the first 
season of "The Tracey Ullman Show," reveal the wisdom of dumping this 
pseudo-hip inanity and keeping "The Simpsons." Things hit rock bottom with 
"Snowie and Seven Dorps" by Candy Kugel and Vince Cafarelli, which repeats the 
clunky designs, stiff animation and colored-line-on-black-background look of 
their recent "Warm Welcome in L.A." An amateurish exercise in graphic 
ineptitude, "Snowie" amounts to a long whine by a pair of wanna-bes at the 
failure of the entertainment industry to appreciate their mediocre talents. 
</P>
<P>
"The Third Animation Celebration" runs for two weeks only at the Nuart in West 
Los Angeles, the Town &amp; Country in Encino, the Balboa Cinema in Newport 
Beach and the Rialto in Pasadena.

RESILIENCY OF GULF COALITION IS A SURPRISE TO MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For more than four months, the vast international coalition that President Bush 
and his aides have stitched together to confront Iraq has proven far stronger, 
and far more resilient, than virtually any foreign policy expert predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Since Iraq invaded Kuwait last Aug. 2, the alliance has not only remained 
intact, and even become stronger, but it also has survived a series of 
blockbuster developments, any one of which might have been enough to cause it 
to crumble: 
</P>
<P>
* The killing of more than a score of Palestinians at Jerusalem's holiest 
Islamic site. 
</P>
<P>
* The downfall of Margaret Thatcher, who had been Bush's strongest European 
ally. 
</P>
<P>
* Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's persistent efforts to divide the alliance by 
using the hostages as bargaining chips. 
</P>
<P>
* Wild fluctuations in oil markets that have weakened the economies of the 
industrialized countries and severely damaged those of poorer nations. 
</P>
<P>
But with the U.N. deadline for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait now three weeks 
away, Administration officials are bracing for what they believe will be the 
toughest tests yet. 
</P>
<P>
And, as the surprise resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze underscored, the U.S. decision to rely on an international 
coalition makes American policy at least partially hostage to unpredictable 
events, many of them far from the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein, officials and private analysts believe, is likely to respond to the 
deadline in one of two ways -- either by attempting to de-escalate the conflict 
by withdrawing partway from Kuwait, or desperately gambling to escape 
encirclement by widening the conflict to include Israel, a move that almost 
certainly would spark a quick military response from that quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing he might do that would, at least initially, face us with the most 
difficult choice is this scenario of a partial withdrawal," says William B. 
Quandt, a former National Security Council official now at the Brookings 
Institution. 
</P>
<P>
Under the partial withdrawal plan, Hussein would, at the last minute, pull his 
troops out of most Kuwaiti territory, including Kuwait city, retreating to a 
line that would give him control over a disputed oil field shared by Iraq and 
Kuwait and two Kuwaiti islands that control the approaches to Iraq's major 
ports. 
</P>
<P>
In theory, U.S. officials could claim that sort of Iraqi action as a major, 
although partial, success: The Kuwaiti royal family and its government could 
return to power. Most of Kuwait's oil production, which is located in the 
southern part of the country, could be resumed. And Hussein would have been 
seen to retreat in the face of international pressure. 
</P>
<P>
But officials fear that in the wake of such a partial withdrawal, support for a 
tough allied stand would erode. And for that reason, over the past week 
President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker III and other top U.S. 
officials have publicly denounced the idea of a partial withdrawal, branding it 
"unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
"A partial withdrawal would reward aggression," Baker said in a press 
conference in Brussels after meeting with European leaders last week. 
</P>
<P>
Other leaders of the coalition have taken the same line. In a press conference 
in Paris last week, French President Francois Mitterrand insisted that the U.N. 
demand for Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait would require Iraq to relinquish "every 
square meter." 
</P>
<P>
In the event of a partial withdrawal, U.S. officials say, Bush would try to 
maintain both military and economic pressure against Iraq. Although U.S. 
officials fear that international support for the trade embargo against Iraq 
might wane, they also believe that the U.S. Navy's presence in the Persian Gulf 
would be enough to ensure that the embargo would stick -- at least as long as 
Turkey and Saudi Arabia continue to block Iraq's oil pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
The more difficult challenge, officials say, would be keeping at least some 
U.S. troops in place to discourage any return by Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no desire on our part to have a permanently stationed U.S. ground 
force in the region," a senior Administration official says. But as of now, 
U.S. officials have no assurance that any other countries would be willing to 
volunteer troops to protect a partially restored Kuwait from Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
The second scenario, an attack on Israel, is widely discounted in Washington 
but is still a major worry in Jerusalem, U.S. officials say. 
</P>

"If you are sitting there within range of Iraqi missiles, you worry about it in 
a way that you do not back here," says California Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, who recently 
returned from a trip to Saudi Arabia and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believe that Hussein might figure that by attacking Israel, he 
could force the Arab members of the coalition -- particularly Saudi Arabia and 
Syria -- to turn against the United States. But most Administration officials 
contend that Hussein's chief desire is simply to survive in power, not to 
engage in a gambit that would almost certainly bring a massive military 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Administration officials will say only that they have consulted with 
all the major coalition allies about what would happen in the event of an Iraqi 
attack on Israel and that, as Bush said in a press conference recently, they 
are "comfortable" with the result of those talks. Officials have been 
resolutely silent about what the President means by that term. 
</P>
<P>
But despite the continuing anxiety about possible Iraqi moves that could 
disrupt the coalition, the reality is that international unity against Iraq so 
far has been remarkably consistent. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts point to several reasons for the coalition's resilience: 
</P>
<P>
First may be Hussein himself. The Iraqi leader has proved less adept at 
manipulating world opinion, even Arab opinion, than many expected. His attempts 
to gain advantage by first seizing hostages and then by gradually releasing 
them backfired. And his troops' depredations in Kuwait seem to have undercut at 
least some of his support among the Arab masses in places such as Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
Second is that Bush has asked for relatively little from most of the other 
nations involved -- besides rhetorical support, patience and, in some cases, 
money. Few world leaders have had to share with Bush the prospect that their 
armed forces might encounter serious casualties if the crisis moved from 
stand-off to shoot-out. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney tacitly acknowledged 
that reality when he conceded that if war comes, very few of the coalition 
partners -- perhaps only Britain, Saudi Arabia and Egypt -- actually would 
fight alongside U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, shutting down the oil production of Iraq and Kuwait so far has had 
relatively little impact on the world economy, giving other nations little 
reason to balk at continued confrontation with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
At the time of the invasion, some analysts predicted that the disruption of oil 
supplies would throw the entire world economy into a recession. Higher oil 
prices have, as usual, badly hurt poor nations from Africa to Eastern Europe, 
deepening the poverty of millions by choking economies that were already 
seriously ill. 
</P>
<P>
But in the world of international power politics, poor nations have little 
voice. Among the nations that could have disrupted Bush's confrontation with 
Iraq, the economic impact of the crisis has been relatively modest. 
</P>
<P>
In June, two months before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the Organization for 
Economic Cooperation and Development estimated that the economies of its 24 
industrialized member nations would grow 2.9% this year. 
</P>
<P>
Measuring the impact of the gulf crisis, the OECD in mid-December downgraded 
that estimate by a scant 0.1%. For 1991, international economic growth will 
slow further, to 2% in the OECD's prediction, but most of the slowdown will be 
caused by the recession in the United States, a downturn that may have been 
partially triggered by the gulf crisis, but which was anticipated long before 
Aug. 2.

HEAD OF KGB BACKS DOWN ON TOUGH REMARKS

<TEXT>
<P>
The head of the KGB, the Soviet security and intelligence service, sought on 
Tuesday to soften the impact of his recent tough speeches with a renewed 
commitment to political reforms at home and improved relations with the West. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir A. Kryuchkov, chairman of the Committee for State Security, as the KGB 
is formally known, told a press conference that his harsh words, particularly a 
weekend speech to the Soviet parliament, had been misunderstood and were not 
intended as a call for a return to the grim regimes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no return to the old ways, neither in domestic policies of the Soviet 
Union nor in its relations with other states," Kryuchkov declared. "Even if 
someone in this country did try to turn back, he would become bankrupt 
immediately because we have entered a new phase in our forward movement, both 
domestically and internationally. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to shift into reverse, though certain corrections need to be 
made in our developments. That's perfectly natural. Our course leads us forward 
on the road of renovation and progress." 
</P>
<P>
Only Saturday, however, Kryuchkov called for a return to the Soviet Union's old 
economic system with its state ownership, central planning and government 
management, arguing that this was necessary at least for a time to stabilize 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
He also criticized essential elements of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
planned reforms and said that the KGB was waiting instead for a new set of 
orders giving it broader powers to pull the country out of its deepening 
political and economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
Kryuchkov in addition accused the West, particularly the U.S. Central 
Intelligence Agency, of attempting to destabilize the Soviet Union by further 
undermining its economy, encouraging ethnic tensions and infiltrating the new 
pro-democracy and free-trade-union movements. 
</P>
<P>
Even the food that the West is now shipping to the Soviet Union, often at 
reduced prices or financed by low-interest credits, is suspect, Kryuchkov 
warned, for nearly half of it does not meet Soviet standards. 
</P>
<P>
"As for my statement being controversial, this too is natural," he said Tuesday 
at the outset of a Kremlin press conference. "It would have been strange indeed 
if a speech by the chairman of the KGB were met with unanimous applause and 
approval. Western countries differ in their understanding of what is happening 
here -- there is both hope and apprehension." 
</P>
<P>
With a smile and bonhomie that reflects his KGB nickname, "Cherub," Kryuchkov 
continued for more than an hour in what a senior foreign policy adviser to 
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev bluntly described as "damage control." 
</P>
<P>
"The cables we have received from our missions abroad about the reaction to 
Kryuchkov's speech on Saturday have been disastrous, simply disastrous," the 
official said. "What he said may have been well intentioned, but even at home 
some people concluded that the KGB was longing for a return to the Stalin era. 
</P>
<P>
"In foreign countries, everything he said was taken as evidence we were moving 
toward that dictatorship (Foreign Minister Eduard A.) Shevardnadze warned about 
when he resigned. Kryuchkov can't take his words back, but he had better 
explain them. That was made clear to him by the president." 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department on Monday denounced Kryuchkov's charges as 
"completely unfounded and inaccurate" and expressed concern that "such a senior 
official would use such outdated and inflammatory rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
Confronted with the task of convincing skeptical audiences at home and abroad 
that the gentler, kinder KGB of the past year and a half is not just a mask for 
the same ruthless organization, Kryuchkov insisted that he had simply been 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
He did not accuse the West of economic sabotage, as it had seemed from his 
speech Saturday to the Congress of People's Deputies, he said, but 
characterized the sharp practices of some Western firms as "akin to economic 
sabotage, which is not the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
"We are speaking about the firms that are insolvent themselves and that would 
like to take advantage of the situation to make money," Kryuchkov explained. 
"As long as Soviet business has not reached a sufficient level in its 
development, it will be making mistakes, and we will have to learn by our 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
And the Soviet Union is "grateful, very grateful" for the Western assistance 
and advice it is now receiving, he repeated several times, and Moscow does not 
regard it as a way of subverting the country into full-scale capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
Even his hard-edged warnings about increased espionage by Western intelligence 
agencies, pursuing different tactics and using new techniques, need to be 
understood properly, Kryuchkov said. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, comrades, ladies and gentlemen, do we really think spies are dropping 
out of the skies?" he said. "I wouldn't want you to think that we ourselves are 
doing nothing in this respect. We are working too. 
</P>
<P>
"And I can understand when the United States tries to evaluate the situation in 
this country, to determine the direction in which we are moving, when they show 
interest in certain problems like our nuclear potential. . . . So, they are 
working, and the most important thing for them here is -- pardon me -- not to 
get caught." 
</P>
<P>
The KGB is, in fact, developing its contacts with the CIA and other Western 
intelligence agencies and starting to cooperate, Kryuchkov continued. Recently, 
it gave the CIA updated Soviet projections of likely casualties from a war in 
the Persian Gulf, apparently based on its first-hand knowledge of the Iraqi 
army, its weaponry and fighting capability. 
</P>
<P>
The message of goodwill was the same on domestic issues -- and a marked 
contrast not only to Kryuchkov's speech to the Congress of People's Deputies 
but also to recent television appearances and newspaper interviews in which he 
has warned of KGB preparedness to act, even with force and at the risk of 
bloodshed, if the crisis here deepens. 
</P>
<P>
"We will act in strict compliance with the law," Kryuchkov told a Soviet 
journalist who asked about his plans -- left vague in his speech -- to deal 
with what he called "destructive forces." "I believe the most important tool 
will be political methods -- that is the main thing. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"You can take any position now, but it is crucial that it be constructive," he 
continued. "You can engage in a struggle, but it is important that this 
struggle proceeds within constitutional limits. You can even say you are 
against Soviet power and agitate against it. Still, this is not a crime. But if 
you resort to violent methods, to unconstitutional means, then you become an 
object for our activities." 
</P>
<P>
If Gorbachev used his presidential powers to declare a state of emergency, to 
rule by decree or to remove local or regional governments, the KGB would 
implement those orders, Kryuchkov told the Soviet journalist, all the while 
downplaying those possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"I worry about the situation in the country, about the possible course of 
events, and as KGB people we are working on the different options for the 
country's development," he said in that earlier interview. "I believe our duty 
is not to allow any dictatorship, but to act within the framework of law. 
</P>
<P>
"If things went wrong, however, the question of extraordinary measures might be 
put on the agenda. I am confident if the president uses them, it will not be a 
return to the past in any way. It will be just setting an order everybody is 
missing, and the right, leftists and centrists are demanding it."

DUBIOUS CONTRACTS MAR MINORITY TRANSIT WORK; 
</P>
<P>
BUSINESS: AT LEAST $50 MILLION WENT TO FIRMS WITH QUESTIONABLE ELIGIBILITY, 
RECORDS AND INTERVIEWS SHOW.

<P>
Tens of millions of dollars in Los Angeles mass transit construction contracts 
intended for small, struggling businesses owned by minorities or women are 
going to firms that do not appear to be disadvantaged or allegedly have acted 
as "fronts" for non-minority firms, The Times has learned. 
</P>
<P>
The "disadvantaged business enterprise" program has not worked as intended 
largely because of loopholes in federal rules and poor enforcement by local 
transit officials, records and interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission overlook warning signs of fronting, fail to share 
important information, are slow to enforce regulations and are ignorant of 
crucial federal rules, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
While minority contracting programs across the nation have been plagued by 
abuses, the stakes are especially high on Los Angeles transit projects. 
Officials say that of the $1.8 billion spent since 1985 on building the subway 
and light rail system, more than $471 million -- or 26% -- has gone to minority 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
But interviews and transit agency documents cast doubt on how much has gone to 
companies that are truly disadvantaged, legally qualified to do the work and 
independent of large prime contractors, as required by law. Records for half a 
dozen minority contractors alone show that at least $50 million worth of work 
was awarded under questionable circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
The Times found: 
</P>
<P>
* A firm owned by a Panama-born businessman named John Benjamin Franklin 
received $7 million worth of minority contracts, but Franklin said that he has 
never suffered any disadvantage as a result of being Latino and that his 
company was highly successful before being certified as a "disadvantaged 
business." 
</P>
<P>
* An Atlanta company that was certified as "disadvantaged" boasted of obtaining 
more than $110 million in federal contracts last year and is partly owned by 
the treasurer of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
* A small, black-owned Los Angeles company that received more than $7 million 
in transit work was a front controlled by a tunneling consortium that was 
awarded $34 million worth of contracts, transit officials now say. 
</P>
<P>
* A woman is listed as the owner of a Van Nuys company that was awarded more 
than $7 million in contracts for disadvantaged businesses, but rival firms and 
transit officials complain that the company was set up as a front and is 
controlled by the owner's husband and brother-in-law. 
</P>
<P>
* An Asian-American company was awarded $3.4 million in contracts and was 
allowed to work for nearly a year although the firm did not have a valid 
contractor's license. Transit officials had evidence in their files indicating 
that the company was a front for a non-minority contractor but took no action 
to bar the firm from transit work until state officials charged the owner in a 
salary kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials argue that the minority contracting program generally is 
working as intended. 
</P>
<P>
"The problems are the exceptions," said RTD General Manager Alan Pegg, who 
noted that the agency was lauded this year by the Los Angeles County Grand Jury 
for its method of certifying disadvantaged businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie Porter, deputy executive director of the county Transportation 
Commission, declined to comment on The Times' findings but said that the 
commission and other public works agencies are attempting to improve 
communication among themselves and to streamline the certification process. 
</P>
<P>
Contracting programs for minorities and women have been beset by troubles from 
coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
"The problem . . . is one of national significance," said David E. Wilson, 
chief of the criminal division of the U.S. attorney's office in Seattle, where 
federal authorities are investigating a fronting scheme in a $1-billion federal 
highway program. 
</P>
<P>
In Baltimore, state authorities filed criminal fraud charges in connection with 
alleged fronting on an airport construction contract. In Houston, city 
officials discovered two fronting operations, one involving a $2.6-million 
sewer contract. The National Assn. of Minority Contractors is investigating 
similar accusations in half a dozen states across the country. 
</P>
<P>
Minority contracts worth $1.5 billion are at stake in Los Angeles, where 
transit agencies have embarked on one of the country's largest public works 
projects. By completion in the year 2010, Los Angeles' planned 300-mile 
commuter rail system will carry a price tag of $7.5 billion -- and officials 
say at least 20% of that money is earmarked for contracts with disadvantaged 
firms. 
</P>
<P>
The rules for awarding such contracts are set by the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, which requires that transit agencies receiving federal funds 
attempt to award at least 10% of construction work to "disadvantaged business 
enterprises." 
</P>
<P>
Construction companies owned by non-minorities are required, when seeking 
transit jobs, to make "good faith" efforts to subcontract varying percentages 
of the work to disadvantaged firms. 
</P>
<P>
To be eligible to receive such subcontracts, a company must meet income 
restrictions and be at least 51% owned by a minority or a woman who controls 
the business. If a company's status as a disadvantaged firm is challenged, the 
owner may be required to show proof of suffering from chronic racial, ethnic or 
sexual discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD is responsible for applying such federal regulations while certifying 
and monitoring disadvantaged businesses that work on the Metro Rail subway. The 
county Transportation Commission bears a similar responsibility on the Blue 
Line and other light-rail projects. 
</P>
<P>
But loopholes in federal regulations allow businessmen who are not 
disadvantaged to be certified for minority contracts. 
</P>
<P>
When John Benjamin Franklin Jr. sought minority contracts on the rapid transit 
project, officials for the RTD and the Transportation Commission apparently 
were not obligated under federal regulations to find out if he had suffered 
social and economic disadvantage because no one challenged his certification. 
</P>
<P>
Franklin was born in Panama but raised partly by an aunt and uncle in Southern 
California. Born Juan Antonio Fernandez, Franklin subsequently took the name of 
his uncle, who was a descendant of Benjamin Franklin. As a teen-ager, he 
attended a private military academy in New Mexico, where he says his aunt sent 
him to keep him out of trouble. Franklin speaks Spanish fluently and English 
without a trace of a Spanish accent. 
</P>
<P>
By all accounts, Franklin built up his business through hard work and long 
hours. He told The Times that he has never suffered discrimination as a 
businessman and acknowledges that his company was highly successful before 
receiving minority certification. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County divorce records show that in June, 1982 -- less than a year 
before his company was first certified as a disadvantaged minority firm by 
Caltrans to do freeway work -- Franklin's community property included a 1979 
Mercedes, a two-story home on a hill in Mission Viejo, condominiums in Hawaii 
and Huntington Beach, and real estate in Whittier, Santa Fe Springs and in the 
area of the Colorado River. At the time, he also engaged in costly hobbies such 
as big game hunting and power boating. 
</P>
<P>
"Why should I get that advantage (as a minority subcontractor)?" Franklin said 
in response to a question. "My answer is I shouldn't. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically the program that's out there helped Franklin Steel immensely," he 
added. "It has not helped the common individual who needs a job." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Franklin maintained that he had a legal right to certification as 
a minority contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials agreed. He was awarded $7 million in transit contracts meant 
for disadvantaged firms from 1987 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Even after Franklin Reinforcing Steel exceeded the federal limit on earnings 
for small, minority companies, the company was certified as disadvantaged by 
the county Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
As of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1988, Franklin Steel had averaged gross 
sales of $15.5 million annually over the previous three years -- nearly $1 
million over the $14.7-million federal limit. Still, it was certified by the 
county Transportation Commission as a disadvantaged company in August, 1988, 
and awarded $800,000 in Blue Line contracts during the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
The commission finally decertified Franklin Steel last February. By that time 
the company was averaging more than $22 million a year in gross sales. 
Commission officials said their tardiness was caused by an oversight. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Applying the Rules 
</P>
<P>
The Transportation Commission and the RTD sometimes reach opposite conclusions 
while applying the same rules, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International Inc. of Atlanta is certified as a minority 
contractor by the RTD although the commission disqualified the company as too 
large. A $1-million minority contract is at stake. 
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications company was founded in 1979 by Joseph Profit, a black 
former football player for the Atlanta Falcons who is president of the firm and 
the major stockholder. The company boasts of obtaining $110 million in 
government contracts last year and of its ties to Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, 
the treasurer of the United States. Villalpando owns more than $260,000 worth 
of stock in the company, and documents in 1987 listed her as owning 10% of the 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International was certified by the RTD in 1985 and, according to 
agency records, began work on a $140,000 phone cable subcontract on transit 
district facilities, even though the firm did not have a state contractor's 
license to perform the job as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
Walter R. Norwood, head of the RTD's office of economic opportunity, told The 
Times that the agency certified Communications International because the 
company had shown the ability to perform cable work on federal jobs. RTD 
officials said the responsibility for making sure that the company was licensed 
rested solely with PacTel InfoSystems -- the prime contractor on the job. 
</P>
<P>
Prime contractors do have such a responsibility under state law, but a PacTel 
official said the company assumed Communications International was licensed 
because the RTD had certified the minority firm. 
</P>
<P>
"RTD gave us the name of (Communications International)," said Stephen Slocum, 
PacTel account manager. "So the assumption was that they had a contractor's 
license. . . . What government agency would certify you if you didn't have 
one?" 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1987, still without a state contractor's license, Communications 
International was certified as a minority firm by the county Transportation 
Commission, which at that time simply accepted RTD certifications without 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
The next year -- as Communications International was about to be awarded a 
$564,000 contract for cable work on the Blue Line -- commission officials found 
that the company did not have the necessary license. 
</P>
<P>
Performing contracting work without a license is a misdemeanor punishable by a 
fine of up to $4,500 for a first offense, but state licensing authorities could 
find no record of a complaint. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer of 1988, Communications International obtained a contractor's 
license for "specialty" work such as low-voltage communications jobs, and the 
company was awarded the $564,000 Blue Line subcontract. 
</P>
<P>
Commission officials now say that Communications International made too much 
money to qualify for the contract and decertified the firm this year. The 
company reported average gross sales of $9.6 million for fiscal years 1986-88 
-- or $2.6 million a year more than the federal government allows for the type 
work performed on the Blue Line, according to Transportation Commission 
officials. The company reported $14.8 million in sales for the fiscal year 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the decertification of Communications International by the commission, 
RTD officials recertified the company this year and assured the firm that it is 
eligible to receive more than $1 million in Metro Rail contracts involving the 
installation of fire alarm and security systems and cable splicing. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood contended that the company is eligible to perform the work because it 
is certified as disadvantaged by the federal government. But federal officials 
said that such certification does not exempt companies from income limitations 
connected to particular jobs, such as the pending Metro Rail contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Profit, company president, insisted that Communications International has not 
exceeded federal size standards for minority subcontractors and is appealing 
the commission's decertification. 
</P>
<P>
Asked about the $110 million in government contracts described in the company's 
promotional literature, Profit said those projects may take years to complete 
and may not bring in that much revenue. He would not reveal how much money the 
company made last fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Slow Enforcement 
</P>
<P>
Enforcement of minority contractor rules can be so slow that companies 
suspected of fronting are allowed to complete jobs and collect millions of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
In early 1988, RTD officials suspected that Doubleday Construction Co., a small 
black firm located in Los Angeles, was a front for Shank-Obayashi, a giant 
consortium formed by an American company and a Japanese business. 
Shank-Obayashi had two Metro Rail contracts worth $34 million. Doubleday's 
subcontracts for concrete work totaled $7.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
In a Feb. 15, 1988, memo, RTD officials asked the federal Department of 
Transportation to investigate, saying, "We have reason to believe (Doubleday 
Construction Co.) is a front." 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials termed the case "egregious" and accused Shank-Obayashi of 
secretly running the jobs that Doubleday supposedly performed. 
</P>
<P>
Both Shank-Obayashi and Doubleday deny that a front relationship existed. 
</P>
<P>
"That's crazy; I wasn't fronting for anyone," said Garland Smith, owner of 
Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
Smith said that Shank-Obayashi leased him equipment and provided an experienced 
supervisor because Doubleday had never done such extensive concrete work. 
</P>
<P>
The help that Doubleday received, Smith pointed out, was not secretive and is 
spelled out in subcontracts that were available to the RTD. Officials of the 
agency said they do not routinely examine minority subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
Despite prodding from the RTD, the federal investigation stalled and sputtered 
for more than two years. Finally last March, federal investigators told the RTD 
that Doubleday was indeed fronting for Shank-Obayashi. 
</P>
<P>
By that time, however, Shank-Obayashi and Doubleday had completed their work on 
the Metro Rail and had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
After receiving the results of the federal investigation, the RTD decertified 
Doubleday. 
</P>
<P>
Last June -- three months after receiving the results of the federal 
investigation -- RTD officials asked the U.S. Department of Transportation to 
bar both Doubleday and Shank-Obayashi from bidding on any federal contracts -- 
the harshest penalty available short of a criminal prosecution. The request is 
pending. 
</P>
<P>
But the RTD did not warn its sister agency, the county Transportation 
Commission, of its concerns about Doubleday until the commission inquired about 
the company last August -- 2 1/2 years after the RTD first recorded its 
suspicions that the firm was acting as a front and five months after federal 
investigators completed their probe. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime -- in late February of 1988 -- a $900,000 minority subcontract 
was awarded to Doubleday by another contractor for work on the Blue Line 
light-rail project being built by the Transportation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood, head of the RTD's office of economic opportunity, said he had not 
notified the commission about the federal investigation sooner because it was 
not his responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not required to tell (the commission) about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
RTD spokeswoman Andrea Greene contended that it was the duty of the federal 
Department of Transportation to notify the commission of the allegations 
against Doubleday. Federal officials denied it was their responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Identifying the 'Fronts' 
</P>
<P>
Transit officials do not always use consistent standards to differentiate 
between fronts and legitimate minority firms. 
</P>
<P>
For example, transit officials have taken no action against Golden Bear 
Concrete Co. although the black-owned Cypress firm appears to depend even more 
heavily on a large non-minority contractor than Doubleday depended on 
Shank-Obayashi. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear Construction, owned by Henry Thompson Jr., has subcontracted for $9 
million worth of Metro Rail tunnel work from three contracting companies headed 
by Tutor-Saliba Construction Co. of Sylmar. The prime contractors are receiving 
a total of $131 million. 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear crews on the jobs are hired, managed and laid off by Tutor-Saliba, 
according to Golden Bear supervisors and union dispatchers. 
</P>
<P>
"I leave the hiring and firing to them," said Tony Rivera, a Golden Bear 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
"Tutor-Saliba is definitely running this job," said Jeff Moseley, who was a 
Golden Bear foreman when he talked to The Times. "The only sign of Golden Bear 
(on the job) is the logo on (Rivera's) truck and the printing on your 
paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
Golden Bear also uses Tutor-Saliba's office space and leases equipment from the 
prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say that such ties can be signs of a classic front. 
</P>
<P>
"The management and daily business of these minority firms must be controlled . 
. . (by the) socially disadvantaged owners," said Robert G. Owen, civil rights 
director of the Department of Transportation's Urban Mass Transit 
Administration. He said disadvantaged subcontractors must do their own hiring 
and firing, supervise their own work force and maintain an independent office 
and payroll system. 
</P>
<P>
But Norwood of the RTD said he is "comfortable" with the arrangement between 
Golden Bear and the larger company. "Tutor-Saliba is providing some 
assistance," he said. "And that seems like a good idea under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
Thompson and Eric Carlin, vice president of Tutor-Saliba, acknowledged that 
Golden Bear was receiving special help from the prime contractor because the 
minority firm was inexperienced in tunnel work, but denied that the 
relationship constitutes a front. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Gender Factor 
</P>
<P>
Firms claiming to be owned and run by women are frequently found to be fronts 
for white males in other parts of the country. But in a Los Angeles case, 
transit officials did not heed signs in their own files that a woman-owned 
company might not be what it claimed. 
</P>
<P>
Zeev Oved and Associates of Van Nuys, a firm that installs handrails and wall 
panels, was founded in 1986, according to RTD records. Zeev Oved, a white male, 
owns 35% of the company and his wife, Esther, owns 65%. 
</P>
<P>
After operating for four years as Zeev Oved and Associates, the company dropped 
the name of Esther's husband from the title last spring when the firm sought 
certification from the RTD as a disadvantaged woman-owned business. The RTD 
certified the company as disadvantaged May 1 and four months later the firm 
legally changed its name to Oved and Associates. 
</P>
<P>
RTD records show that Esther Oved had previously worked as a saleswoman for her 
husband's brother, Pinhas Oved, who operated a business similar to Oved and 
Associates. 
</P>
<P>
Pinhas Oved subsequently joined the new firm and handles estimates, bidding and 
supervision of jobs. Esther runs the office and says she manages the company 
along with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
"I worked for Pinhas," said Esther Oved, "and it's funny, now Pinhas works for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
In addition, another male relative, Jacov Oved -- a cousin of Zeev -- holds the 
contractor's license for the company. "I chose him because he had a license," 
Esther Oved said. "I was not qualified for a license." 
</P>
<P>
Between May and September, the company was awarded $7.8 million in 
disadvantaged business contracts on Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
In September, two competitors of Oved and Associates formally complained to the 
RTD that Esther was acting as a front for her husband and male relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"They want me out of the way," Esther said of the complainants. "I run this 
company." 
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that her brother-in-law, Pinhas Oved, does "man's work," 
while she controls the company from an office. 
</P>
<P>
"I can run my company from here," she said. "I do not need to negotiate with 
men." 
</P>
<P>
After The Times inquired about complaints against Oved and Associates, the RTD 
notified the company on Nov. 9 that it was being decertified as a disadvantaged 
firm on the grounds that Esther is not really in control. Officials based their 
action on information such as the history of the firm, which has been in the 
RTD file since the business was certified six months ago. The company is 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
The Lack of Licenses 
</P>
<P>
In another case, transit officials not only overlooked evidence of a front in 
their files, but also failed to take prompt action when warned that a minority 
company was working without a valid state contractor's license and was involved 
in a kickback scheme. 
</P>
<P>
PIE Construction Inc., an Asian-American firm owned by Gregory C. Park of San 
Dimas, was awarded $3.4 million worth of minority subcontracts for electrical 
work on the Metro Rail in 1987. In July, 1988, the firm's contracting license 
was suspended by state officials for undisclosed reasons. The license expired 
two months later, but the company kept working. 
</P>
<P>
In December, 1988, investigators for the International Brotherhood of 
Electrical Workers complained to the RTD that PIE was operating without a valid 
contractor's license and that the company was forcing workers to kick back part 
of their salaries in order to keep their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
When the RTD took no action, the union turned over its complaints regarding 
alleged payroll kickbacks to state labor officials who filed criminal charges 
against Park in August, 1989. He pleaded guilty to accepting payroll kickbacks, 
was ordered to pay $178,000 restitution and was placed on five years' 
probation. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials could not explain why the agency did nothing about the kickback 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
While the union's complaint was pending, the RTD allowed PIE to continue 
working on Metro Rail subcontracts for several months without a valid 
contractor's license. 
</P>
<P>
PIE was forced to give up the jobs in May, 1989, but RTD officials permitted 
another firm that was partly owned by Park -- Citicon Inc. to immediately take 
over the two Metro Rail subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
Park owned Citicon in partnership with George Dickey, a white electrical 
contractor. The company's certification as a disadvantaged minority firm was 
authorized by RTD economic opportunity chief Norwood, despite objections of a 
staff member who said that the white partner exercised too much control over 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
Three weeks after Citicon's takeover of the PIE contracts, Norwood changed his 
mind about Citicon and decertified the firm, alleging that it was a front for 
Dickey. 
</P>
<P>
"We find that the non-minority owner, George Dickey, exercises disproportionate 
control over the management and daily operations of Citicon Inc.," wrote 
Norwood on June 7, 1989. He also alleged that Citicon was set up by Park and 
Dickey to "subvert the certification and take over PIE Construction's RTD 
contracts." 
</P>
<P>
Even so, Citicon continued to work on the Metro Rail subcontracts for another 
three months. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, RTD records show that the agency overlooked early warnings that 
Park and Dickey might be operating a front. In November, 1988, and January, 
1989, a company called Airways Electric was listed, along with PIE, on 
certified payroll records as having paid PIE employees for work on Metro Rail 
subcontracts. Airways Electric is wholly owned by Dickey and had no official 
connection with the Metro Rail work, but again RTD officials took no action for 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood wrote on July 27, 1989: "It was determined that Airways Electric, owned 
by Mr. Dickey, and PIE, owned by Mr. Park, arranged to have PIE's employees 
paid through Airways Electric on both Metro Rail Contracts." 
</P>
<P>
"PIE appeared to be a front for Airways," RTD spokeswoman Greene said recently. 
She acknowledged that the RTD had not acted promptly on available evidence that 
pointed to a front. 
</P>
<P>
Park has denied acting as a front and Dickey could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood said the question of how RTD handled the case is moot because no firms 
connected with Park are certified to receive minority contracts and no further 
action is needed. 
</P>
<P>
But Gene Lyon, former electrical union investigator who worked on the PIE case, 
remains dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
"The RTD's shallow investigation of this whole thing," he said, "was a major 
display of ineptness and casts doubt on the RTD's ability to carry out its 
responsibilities."

LOS ANGELES TRANSIT CONTRACTS TO MINORITIES AND WOMEN 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District and the Los Angeles County 
Transportation Commission had spent $1.2 billion on Metro Rail and the Blue 
Line by June 30, 1990. Of that amount $266 million-just over 25%-had gone to 
firms that the transit agencies had certified as disadvantaged minority-or 
women-owned businesses. By fall, the amount paid to such firms had increased to 
$471 million. However, a Times investigation revealed that tens of millions of 
dollars have gone to companies with questionable minority status, businesses 
that do not appear to be truly disadvantaged or firms that served as "fronts" 
for white, male-dominated prime contractors.

QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS 
</P>
<P>
 A firm owned by an ethnic minority or a woman must be certified as a 
"disadvantaged business enterprise" by the Southern California Rapid Transit 
District or the Los Angeles County Transportation Commission to participate in 
the equal opportunity program for construction contractors on local transit 
projects. To date the RTD has certified 371 firms. The commission has certified 
234, including some that are on the RTD lists. 
</P>
<P>
To qualify an applicant MUST: 
</P>
<P>
* Prove the firm is 51% minority-owned or owned by a woman. Minorities include 
blacks, Hispanics, Asians and Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
* Have a state contractor's license to be certified by the commission. The RTD 
does not require such a license. 
</P>
<P>
* Gross less than $14.7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
* Demonstrate that he or she actively manages the firm's affairs and is in 
control of all work subcontracted to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
* Demonstrate that he or she is a disadvantaged minority, if challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Note: Neither the RTD nor the commission attempts to determine if the 
owner-manager of a certified company has the skills or the financial capability 
to perform the contracted work.

<P>
It all began with Alvin Rivera's memos. 
</P>
<P>
The documents appear innocuous enough -- routine queries within the Southern 
California Rapid Transit District regarding a company seeking minority 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
But Rivera's questions last year about Communications International Inc. soon 
snowballed into a major controversy involving accusations of favoritism and 
forgery, an RTD internal investigation, the subsequent firing of the 
investigators and an ongoing inquiry by the Los Angeles County district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International was founded by Joseph Profit, a black former 
running back with the Atlanta Falcons who is the majority owner and president. 
The Atlanta-based firm, which is designated a disadvantaged business by the 
federal Small Business Administration, boasts in promotional literature of 
obtaining $110 million in government contracts last year. It also touts its 
connection with Catalina Vasquez Villalpando, part owner of the company and 
treasurer of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Communications International entered the field of minority companies vying for 
rapid transit work in Los Angeles in 1985 and was subsequently awarded a 
$140,000 minority contract. The company began work even though it had no 
contractor's license, as required by law. 
</P>
<P>
After transit officials discovered in June, 1988, that Communications 
International did not have the license, the firm hired a San Leandro 
contractor, Richard B. Eggers, to act as the company's "responsible managing 
employee." Eggers obtained a contractor's license on behalf of the company the 
next month and in September, 1988, the firm was awarded another minority rapid 
transit job in Los Angeles worth $564,000. 
</P>
<P>
But Alvin Rivera, contract compliance officer for the RTD, was disturbed by the 
size of Communications International and by his belief that Eggers is not a 
member of an ethnic minority. 
</P>
<P>
On April 4, 1989, Rivera wrote to Walter Norwood, head of the RTD's equal 
opportunity office: 
</P>
<P>
"For your information, Communications International Inc. is up for 
recertification as a (disadvantaged business). A problem with their continued 
certification is that their license holder and (responsible managing employee) 
is non-minority. This situation is not unlike others, which we have denied 
routinely in the past." 
</P>
<P>
"(H)ad this fact been uncovered during the (certification) investigation," 
Rivera wrote in another memo to Norwood three days later, "this firm would not 
have been certified." Rivera declined to talk to The Times about why he 
concluded Eggers is a non-minority. 
</P>
<P>
George Armstrong, vice president of Communications International's Western 
region, subsequently said Eggers is indeed a minority because he is of 
Portuguese descent, an ethnic group designated by federal authorities as 
disadvantaged. 
</P>
<P>
"Mr. Eggers is a minority . . . , " Armstrong told The Times. "I don't know if 
Mr. Eggers wants everybody to know that." 
</P>
<P>
When The Times asked Eggers during a phone interview if he belonged to a 
minority group, he identified himself as Spanish rather than Portuguese. Asked 
the extent of his Spanish lineage, Eggers said, "I'll have to find out." 
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that he might be 90% Spanish but would have to ask his 
mother. In a subsequent interview, he said that he is of Spanish and Portuguese 
descent and that his father was 100% Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
RTD officials said they have no documentation that Eggers is a member of an 
ethnic minority except for a letter Armstrong wrote last summer saying that the 
contractor is Portuguese. RTD officials said the letter has been misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, Norwood contended that the question of Eggers' minority status is 
irrelevant because Eggers was not in reality directing work for Communications 
International -- as state law requires the holder of a contractor's license to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
"They only used Eggers for his license . . . , " Norwood told The Times. "He 
didn't direct the activities of anyone. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
"I did, too," Eggers said in a phone interview. "I was there . . . working." 
</P>
<P>
On April 19, 1989, Norwood overrode Rivera's concerns about Communications 
International and ordered a secretary to stamp Rivera's signature on a document 
notifying the company that it had been recertified as a disadvantaged minority 
firm. Norwood said he was acting within his authority as head of the office of 
economic opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
When Rivera discovered that his signature stamp had been used, he wrote on a 
copy of the recertification document: "This is not my signature. It is a stamp, 
used unbeknownst to me." An investigation into alleged favoritism and forgery 
involving Rivera's signature stamp was subsequently demanded by the 
International Union of Operating Engineers Local 12 -- which was angry at 
Communications International over the hiring of non-union workers. 
</P>
<P>
The inspector general's office of the RTD began an inquiry into the complaint 
last February, but investigators Richard Yeats and Allen Laster say that they 
were unable to obtain needed documents because Norwood did not cooperate. They 
also accuse RTD Inspector General Ernesto V. Fuentes of failure to use the 
power of his office to obtain documents. 
</P>
<P>
Norwood and Fuentes deny the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
The matter finally came to a head when Rivera complained to investigators that 
Inspector General Fuentes warned him that his career might suffer if he 
continued to cooperate with the inquiry, according to Yeats and Allen. Rivera 
would not comment to The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The RTD investigators say that they were fired by Fuentes on July 18, when they 
informed him that they intended to tell the district attorney's office that he 
had been accused of interfering with the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
Fuentes was reluctant to discuss details of the case because of the ongoing 
district attorney's investigation, but he denied advising Rivera not to 
cooperate with Yeats and Allen. 
</P>
<P>
Terming the allegation of interference "ridiculous," Fuentes said he 
subsequently ordered the investigators' report -- including the allegation 
against himself -- sent to the district attorney's office. He said he is 
prohibited by law from disclosing why Yeats and Allen were fired. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Herb Lapin said he is still investigating allegations of 
forgery involving the use of Rivera's signature stamp. He said he is also 
looking into the accusation that Rivera was intimidated by Fuentes, as well as 
the possibility that state "whistle-blower" laws were violated in connection 
with the firing of Yeats and Laster. 
</P>
<P>
"They need to start over, over there," Lapin said of the RTD. "Dismantle it and 
start again." 
</P>
<P>
As for Rivera, he transferred from his job as a contract compliance officer and 
works in promoting and marketing the RTD.

ARAB LEADERS END SUMMIT WITH DEMAND FOR IRAQ'S WITHDRAWAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
DOHA, Qatar 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Arab sheiks and emirs of the Persian Gulf concluded a summit Tuesday without 
any new breakthroughs on a peaceful resolution to the crisis in Kuwait but 
issued a last, uncompromising demand for Iraqi troops to withdraw or face "the 
perils of a devastating war." 
</P>
<P>
Clearly backing the United States in its effort to stare down Iraqi President 
Saddam Hussein in the countdown before the United Nations' Jan. 15 deadline for 
withdrawal, the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council reaffirmed 
their backing for previous international resolutions and left all remaining 
options for compromise in the hands of the Iraqi leader. 
</P>
<P>
"The council repeats its demands that the Iraqi leadership should respect 
international charters and norms and the agreements it signed with the state of 
Kuwait, and resort to peace . . . and not to endanger the lives and waste the 
potentialities of Iraq's people in a confrontation that would not realize 
anything other than loss and devastation," the leaders of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, 
Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Oman said in their final 
communique. 
</P>
<P>
During a four-day summit in the Qatari capital, their first since Iraq's Aug. 2 
invasion of Kuwait, the gulf leaders resolved to improve relations with 
non-Arab Iran, boost future regional defenses and strengthen their ties in 
order to avoid the mistakes of the past. 
</P>
<P>
"We should recognize that the Arab system has failed to confront the disaster 
and has made little contribution to tackle the problem," Saudi Arabia's King 
Fahd said in an unusually frank statement issued near the conclusion of the 
summit. "We should revise the order of the gulf house so as to emerge from this 
crisis stronger." 
</P>
<P>
Part of the revised order will undoubtedly include improved relations with Iran 
-- the very country whose threats from the other side of the Persian Gulf 
throughout the 1980s first led to the creation of the gulf alliance. 
</P>
<P>
On the opening day of the summit, Qatar's foreign minister, Mubarak ibn Ali al 
Khatar, announced that talks are under way to include Iran in any new security 
arrangements that are drafted for the gulf region. "We have historic ties with 
Iran . . . and it is entering in the security arrangement by right of its 
geographic significance," he told reporters here. 
</P>
<P>
The council's final communique lauded efforts by other "brotherly and friendly 
countries" to try to achieve a peaceful settlement of the crisis but fell far 
short of reported attempts by some delegates, led by Oman, to dispatch an envoy 
to Baghdad in an attempt to determine what it would take to persuade the Iraqi 
leader to withdraw his forces. 
</P>
<P>
Discussions became nearly quagmired at one point when Oman's Sultan Kaboos ibn 
Said reportedly threatened to hold off any support for a military attack 
against Iraq unless peaceful options were explored further, summit sources 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Other gulf leaders insisted on maintaining a united international front, and 
King Fahd issued one of his strongest statements since the beginning of the 
crisis, declaring that there is still room for a peaceful resolution but that 
the gulf is also prepared for war. 
</P>
<P>
"We have not decided either a decision for war or peace, but we have taken a 
decision for the return of Kuwait, peacefully if possible or by war when war 
becomes inevitable," the Saudi monarch said. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to close the doors of hope: Up to now, the person who we thought 
one day was our friend can avert (for) himself and his nation the horrors of 
war. When he chose confrontation, we have shown him that we are capable of 
confrontation. When he decides to choose concord, we are also capable of opting 
for concord. The decision of peace has proved to be more brave than the 
decision of war." 
</P>
<P>
Most analysts say the gulf leaders are probably powerless to shape the outcome 
of a crisis that has become balanced between Washington and Baghdad. Yet the 
Iraqi leader has made overtures to the gulf, dispatching his foreign minister, 
Tarik Aziz, for talks in Oman and, according to the Iraqi ambassador in Doha, 
submitting a proposal that the six GCC countries help develop an "Arabian" 
solution to the crisis centered on the gulf nations of the Arabian peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the Gulf Cooperation Council nations stand to have leverage over both 
Iraq and Kuwait because it may be largely from their coffers that both 
countries are revitalized once the crisis is over, said John Duke Anthony of 
the National Council on U.S. Arab Relations, who attended the summit. 
</P>
<P>
"They have all sorts of lines of communications out -- probing, testing, 
evaluating what would be the appropriate mix for the region," now and in the 
future, Anthony said. "These countries are Iraq's neighbors. The U.S. isn't. 
And, yes, they will have to find an arrangement to live as neighbors in the 
future."

Conference sources said the GCC had strongly urged the United States to send a 
senior envoy to Baghdad before President Bush's proposal to exchange visits 
between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz, 
an initiative that thus far has been blocked by a failure to agree on dates for 
the visits. 
</P>
<P>
However, a Saudi newspaper editor said by the conclusion of this week's summit: 
"The drums of war are beating. . . . In any case, it's out of their hands. It's 
between Washington and Baghdad." 
</P>
<P>
The gulf leaders discussed a range of options for increasing future defense 
cooperation in the region, with several gulf officials advocating a gulf-wide 
defense force of perhaps 50,000 troops as a deterrent to future aggression 
against the wealthy but largely weak oil emirates.

Military Front: Senior defense officials have advised the White House that the 
military will not be ready to attack Iraq until several weeks after the Jan. 15 
deadline set by the United Nations for withdrawal from Kuwait. If President 
Bush accepts a military recommendation for a delay, it will give Iraq's Saddam 
Hussein some breathing room. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops gathered in the shadow of war to observe Christmas with carols, 
religious services and traditional turkey dinners. 
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic Front: Saudi Arabia and its five Arab allies in the Gulf Cooperation 
Council concluded a summit in Qatar without any new breakthroughs on a peaceful 
resolution to the Kuwait crisis. But the nations issued a last, uncompromising 
demand for Iraqi troops to withdraw or face "the perils of a devastating war." 
</P>
<P>
Hints of compromise emerged in mixed signals from Baghdad, but in general the 
government's hard line toward Kuwait remained unaltered. In several interviews, 
Hussein has stuck to his contention that Kuwait is an inalienable part of Iraq.

BRITISH COMMANDERS SAY AIR POWER MIGHT WIN WAR WITHOUT USING ARMY

British air commanders believe that if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf, a 
massive initial air strike against Iraqi positions would give allied forces air 
superiority and could even bring victory without involving ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
Under the right circumstances, the allied air forces could win a war without 
using the army for the first time in history, said Air Vice Marshal Bill 
Wratten, deputy commander of Britain's gulf forces. 
</P>
<P>
Britain's contribution to the allied air offensive plan is the Tornado 
warplane, equipped with JP 233 bombs. 
</P>
<P>
The JP 233 bomb, which blows craters in airfield runways and showers hundreds 
of "bomblets" to prevent ground crews from clearing the damage, is seen as 
crucial in keeping Iraqi warplanes out of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
British air chiefs say an Iraqi air base could be closed for up to 36 hours 
after a JP 233 attack. 
</P>
<P>
The Tornadoes are expected to form part of mixed groups of allied aircraft sent 
into the attack. 
</P>
<P>
The pilots of the sand-colored Tornadoes based at Bahrain's Muharraq air base 
hone their skills at practice ranges in the Saudi Arabian desert. 
</P>
<P>
They train to fly at 100 feet altitude and at a speed of 600 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
The Tornadoes and a squadron of Jaguars also based at Muharraq are training for 
day and night operations as the United Nations deadline of Jan. 15 approaches 
for Iraq to leave Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The base commander, Group Capt. David Henderson, said he believes that initial 
air superiority could be won within hours and full control of the skies secured 
in days.

CANCER NOW THE LEADING KILLER OF MIDDLE-AGED, STUDIES SHOW

Cancer has overtaken heart disease as the leading killer of middle-aged 
Americans, researchers reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
They reported also that the overall death rate among Americans fell 35.6% 
between 1950 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
"It is evident that the patterns of . . . mortality in the United States are 
changing," the Southern Illinois School of Medicine researchers wrote in the 
Journal of the American Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The studies analyzed death rate data from the National Center for Health 
Statistics from 1950 through 1986 in relation to six illnesses that are or have 
been the most frequent causes of death. 
</P>
<P>
The drop in the overall death rate was due to fewer deaths from important 
killers such as injuries, childbirth complications, flu and pneumonia, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
For those 35 to 64, cancer has "now overtaken heart disease as the leading 
cause of death," the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
Heart disease is currently the leading cause of death among people 65 and older 
and accounts for nearly half of all deaths among those 85 and older, the 
researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost 20% of our population dies after age 85, and, if present trends 
continue, within the next 10 or 20 years almost half of all deaths will occur 
after age 80," they said.

Volunteers warmed the lives of the sick, poor and homeless Tuesday as Christmas 
gave Americans a merry break from wallet-watching and war wariness. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot change the world, but I know for a fact I can make a difference," 
said Iqbal Emamudeen of Orange, N. J., a publicist for a chain of drugstores. 
He was among about 135 volunteers serving Christmas lunch to hundreds of 
homeless and needy people at a church agency in downtown Newark. 
</P>
<P>
In New York City, more than 1,000 homeless people turned out in a hotel in 
mid-town Manhattan for free meals of turkey and stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
Some charitable organizations in the Northeast blamed the economic downturn and 
government cutbacks for a doubling in the demand for services. But, in New 
Hampshire, food bank organizers said charity was keeping pace. 
</P>
<P>
"The donations have picked up tremendously," said Thomas Murphy, volunteer 
administrator of the Monadnock Area Food Bank in Peterborough, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
In Chicago, Department of Human Services crews went in search of the homeless 
in 20-degree temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
Greg Ervin, 25, who became homeless two weeks ago when his family split up and 
abandoned its South Side apartment, has been sleeping on old carpeting 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
"Even though I'm homeless, Christmas is still the same," Ervin said. "I'm going 
to see my family." 
</P>
<P>
Charity took a holiday in Miami, meanwhile, at least for a while. A mob of 
looters raided a Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services office on 
Christmas Eve and hauled off hundreds of toys intended for Dade County's needy. 
</P>
<P>
"It was chaotic," department supervisor Jacob Bery said. "People were just 
walking out with boxes of toys, bags of toys. There were loads of people, 25 to 
30 of them. It was like a mob. From children to grown-ups -- old, middle-aged, 
young, you name it." 
</P>
<P>
But Christmas came for the needy nonetheless when the 4th Marine Division, 8th 
Tank Battalion, loaded a van with goodies it had received from a car dealership 
and took them to Health and Rehabilitative Services supervisor Linda Griskin. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking around for another needy organization to donate them to, and 
that's when Linda called," Staff Sgt. John Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
Across the nation, a powerful winter weather system answered many dreams for a 
white Christmas but was accompanied by deadly cold that made the holiday a test 
of survival. Weather-related deaths since Dec. 18 rose to at least 81. 
</P>
<P>
Snow covered the ground in most of the northern third of the nation, and more 
was falling in the upper Midwest and plains states Tuesday as another arctic 
cold front pushed through the region. 
</P>
<P>
High winds caused blowing snow in much of Minnesota, cutting visibility to near 
zero in some areas and sending the wind chill factor -- the way cold feels to 
the skin -- to as low as minus 60 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Albuquerque, N.M., had its coldest Christmas on record at 1 degree. Eugene, 
Ore., had a record low of 15, the seventh day in a row that the city's morning 
low matched or set a record. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures made for an average December day in New England, with 18 degrees 
in Albany, N.Y., but an uncomfortably chilly one in the South, where the low in 
Atlanta was about 15 degrees.

Although sunshine bathed California on Christmas, chilly temperatures gripping 
the state for a sixth day left thousands of homeowners coping with frozen water 
pipes and farmers tabulating freeze damage to crops. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a record-breaking cold system," Jerry Steiger of the National Weather 
Service said Tuesday in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of the cold air now is moving eastward. . . . It looks like we're going 
to warm up." Temperatures plummeted to record lows in some cities again on 
Tuesday. Sacramento Airport's 22-degree reading broke the record 27-degree low 
reached on Christmas Day 1982, and the 22 degrees in Bakersfield was the 
coldest Dec. 25 since a 24-degree reading in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
Other record lows included 35 degrees in San Francisco, 29 at Moffett Field and 
34 at the Alameda Naval Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
The high temperature at the Los Angeles Civic Center Tuesday was "a balmy 68," 
said Steve Burback, a meteorologist with WeatherData Inc., which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
He predicted a high of 70 degrees for today, with light winds, and a low 
tonight of about 40 degrees. Thursday should be a few degrees warmer, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold snap cracked thousands of water pipes, leaving about 12,000 people in 
the Santa Cruz Mountains without water. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real pain," said Sophie Russell, 61, of Ben Lomond, who has been out of 
water since temperatures plummeted to 10 degrees Saturday night. She was among 
the 75% of the San Lorenzo Valley Water District's customers expected to be 
without water until today. 
</P>
<P>
A warming trend was predicted for the rest of the week, but agricultural 
officials said it was too late for crops damaged by the frigid air mass dubbed 
the "Arctic Express."

At his death, Walker was planning to serve 1,000 Christmas dinners for Project 
Open Hand, a program that provides meals to homebound people with AIDS. Walker 
became full-time chef for Project Open Hand just hours before the quake struck 
Oct. 17, 1989. "We fed 10,000 victims in one day and 50,000 the first week 
after the quake. He engineered it all," said project founder Ruth Brinker. "I

COUNTY FACES OPPOSITION IN COALITION BID; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: SANTA BARBARA AND SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTIES ARE SEEN AS NEEDED ALLIES 
IF A POWERFUL REGIONAL GOVERNMENT IS CREATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Armed with agricultural maps and slow-growth ordinances, local officials are 
asking Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to drop their negative 
notions about Ventura County and form a tri-county coalition before a regional 
government bill comes up for a vote. 
</P>
<P>
The bill, submitted two weeks ago by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, lumps 
Ventura County in with Los Angeles, Orange and several other urban counties to 
the south. But Ventura County officials say a tri-county coalition would give 
them an escape route from the legislation and allow the county to participate 
in a regional government where it would have more political clout. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Ventura County has a long way to go if it is to win over its two 
northern neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo officials have stated that they don't want 
anything to do with Ventura County because they see it as an urban giant with 
strong ties to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura County is seen as just one step closer to Los Angeles," said Tom 
Rogers, a Santa Barbara County supervisor. "And that's just where people here 
don't want to be." 
</P>
<P>
A meeting has been set for Jan. 6 in Santa Barbara for the three counties to 
discuss the issue. The group has met once before in anticipation of legislative 
action that would tie the county to the Los Angeles area. 
</P>
<P>
"All Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo have seen of Ventura County is what's 
along the 101 freeway," said Charlotte Craven, a Camarillo councilwoman who 
helped start the effort to join the two northern counties. 
</P>
<P>
"We want to show them our greenbelts and our growth control laws," she said. 
With more than 325,000 acres of agricultural land, the county is much more 
rural than officials to the north might think. 
</P>
<P>
Fillmore Councilman Roger Campbell added: "Ventura County could serve as an 
excellent buffer to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties. If we get 
swallowed up in a regional government with Los Angeles, the growth will keep 
coming. . . . It will be right at their doorstep." 
</P>
<P>
According to Brown's bill -- which is expected to come up for a hearing by 
spring -- regional governments would be established throughout the state to 
handle land-use planning and infrastructure development. They would be given 
taxing power and authority to decide where such things as roads and dumps would 
be placed. The regions also would be given the task of identifying housing 
needs and areas for future development. 
</P>
<P>
Under the bill, the regions would include the San Francisco Bay Area, the San 
Diego area, the Los Angeles area, the Central Valley, the north central coast 
and the south central coast. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles region envisioned by the Brown bill would encompass the six 
counties now in the Southern California Assn. of Governments. SCAG, as now 
composed, serves primarily as an advisory body with little power. Ventura 
County is a member of SCAG, along with Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, 
Riverside and Imperial counties. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed South Central Coast region would only embrace Santa Barbara and 
San Luis Obispo counties. 
</P>
<P>
Brown had proposed a similar version of the bill at the end of the session last 
year, but he withdrew it because he could not gather enough support. 
</P>
<P>
"My aim with this legislation is for the nation's most populous state to 
finally come to grips with the problems of overcrowded roads, air pollution and 
unaffordable housing," Brown said when he filed his new bill. 
</P>
<P>
The powerful San Francisco assemblyman's staff members say the legislation is 
being received more positively than before. Ventura County officials say they 
are proceeding as if the bill will be approved, although some legislative 
representatives have expressed doubts that Brown will be successful because the 
bill seeks to make such a big change in local government. Municipal and county 
jurisdictions would be required to adhere to decisions made by the regional 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
A Brown spokesman says the proposed regions are not "chiseled in stone" and 
realignments would be considered if counties can demonstrate that they support 
boundary changes. 
</P>
<P>
"There is flexibility," said Michael Reese, Brown's communications director. 
</P>
<P>
One provision in the bill would make each area responsible for making sure each 
community has its "fair share" of housing and industry. Ventura County 
officials say that is a key reason to abandon the Los Angeles region. 
</P>
<P>
"We're afraid they won't recognize our growth-control laws," Craven, the 
Camarillo councilwoman, said. "We're afraid their growth control practices are 
going to get crammed down our throats." 
</P>
<P>
Craven said she is also concerned because the bill calls for a 13-member 
governing board in each region. And since there are an estimated 15 million 
people within SCAG boundaries, Ventura County -- with a population of about 
600,000 -- would only get one representative, Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, officials in Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties have used 
the same argument as a reason not to hook up with Ventura County. If the three 
counties joined, Ventura County would account for 62% of the population. 
</P>
<P>
"Should we become aligned with Ventura County, they might overwhelm us," said 
Jerry Lorden, the executive director of the Santa Barbara County Assn. of 
Governments. "I can't really see what we would gain by joining up with them." 
</P>
<P>
But Craven said she and others would be willing to give Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties equal representation on the tri-county board. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be starting all over and I certainly would be willing to go at it 
evenly," Craven said. 
</P>
<P>
Lorden, however, questioned whether equal representation would solve the 
differences. 
</P>
<P>
"It is tough for us to see what Ventura County's direct linkage is with Santa 
Barbara," Lorden said. "There is a common perception that Ventura County is 
more amenable toward accommodating growth." 
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, a substantial portion of Ventura County is linked to the south," 
Lorden continued. "Yet they say they need to be aligned with Santa Barbara. 
That's hard for us to swallow." 
</P>
<P>
Ron DeCarli, the executive director of the San Luis Obispo Area Coordinating 
Council, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Ventura County still remains part of the Los Angeles region," DeCarli said. 
"Besides, we're too far removed from it." 
</P>
<P>
And Evelyn Delany, the chairwoman of the San Luis Obispo Board of Supervisors, 
added: "I have nothing against Ventura County, except we have enough problems 
of our own. To add Ventura County to it would make it very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
Complicating the matter, several officials in the eastern portion of Ventura 
County say they prefer to be included in a region with the Los Angeles area, a 
vivid example of Ventura County's own longstanding regional differences. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't turn our back on Los Angeles and pretend like they don't exist," 
Simi Valley Mayor Gregory Stratton said. 
</P>
<P>
County Supervisor-elect Vicky Howard agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone recognizes that we have very close ties with the Los Angeles 
area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Besides, Howard said, the southern urban areas could learn from Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
"The Los Angeles area has let things run away," said Howard, a former Simi 
Valley councilwoman. "It is important for us to have input into that area and 
take a leadership role and encourage them to solve their problems." 
</P>
<P>
Howard said she questions whether enough support could be gathered in the 
eastern portion of the county -- which accounts for a little less than half the 
county's population -- to form a tri-county regional government. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Mayor Richard Francis said he can see both sides of the argument, but 
he feels that overall the county has more in common with Santa Barbara and San 
Luis Obispo counties. He cited air quality and traffic problems as examples.

"We need to actively pursue Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties to make 
sure a regional government with them remains an option," Francis said. "Right 
now they have little understanding of who we are or what we are."

NEW COLD FRONT MAY THREATEN GROWERS' CITRUS, AVOCADO TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With much of Ventura County's citrus and avocado crop already devastated by 
last weekend's freeze, growers may now have to fight to save the trees 
themselves, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers and other county residents enjoyed a brief reprieve of warm weather 
Christmas Day as temperatures reached near 70 in inland communities, National 
Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
But by Saturday and Sunday, the next cold front from the Northwest will again 
deliver freezing temperatures that will top out in the 40s or low 50s during 
the day and dip into the low 20s at night, Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures could plunge even further throughout the county if the cold front 
contains an air mass that originated in Siberia before it moved across the 
Arctic to the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
The results could be severe, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If the colder Arctic air comes down the coast and doesn't veer off into the 
southwest desert, we may reach the point where the growers will have to forget 
trying to save the fruit and just try to save their trees," Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, much of the coast and some inland areas -- including the 
agriculturally rich Santa Clara Valley and the Los Posas and Santa Rosa valleys 
-- were spared the several hours of sustained frost that cripples trees. But 
those areas probably will not be as lucky this weekend, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"This might be a much more democratic-type freeze," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer said satellite information today should tell growers for certain 
whether the Arctic mass will skirt the county or cast a pall of heavy frost 
over the county's biggest agricultural commodity -- lemons, worth $164 million 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
County agriculture officials estimated the crop damage at $100 million 
countywide Monday. But the losses could surge, reaching into the crop yields 
for the next two or three years if the extremely cold freeze hits, said Richard 
Pidduck, a citrus and avocado grower in Santa Paula Canyon along California 150 
north of Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
"My entire avocado crop is 100% loss," he said. "And I suspect my citrus is 
largely lost. We can't suffer much more fruit damage, but if we get a lot of 
wood damage on the trees, they could be out of production for two or three 
years." 
</P>
<P>
Pidduck said each crop is worth about $100,000 to his ranch a year. 
</P>
<P>
He said the losses will mean lean years for the growers and higher prices to 
consumers. 
</P>
<P>
If consumers "don't begrudge us the occasional good year we have in citrus and 
avocado farming, we won't complain too loudly about the occasional bad year," 
said Pidduck, whose family has farmed in Ventura County since the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
At Pidduck's orchard, the broad leaves of the tall avocado trees were darkened 
and limp, their edges burned and crisp. Many of the usually waxy green leaves 
on the lemon trees were gold and curled, causing the tree to rattle when the 
wind blew. 
</P>
<P>
The new lemon trees, the most vulnerable to freeze damage, lost much of their 
foliage, and the tiny fruit they bore had turned into dark marble-sized balls. 
</P>
<P>
Orange trees, the hardiest of the citrus crop, fared better, with much of the 
damage limited to the leaves. 
</P>
<P>
Randy Axell said some of his 100-acre citrus and avocado ranch near Santa Paula 
had been spared from the freeze last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"This particular ranch isn't a total loss yet," he said. "We still have a lot 
of optimism. But there are a lot of folks out there who were a lot less 
fortunate than us." 
</P>
<P>
Growers can do little more than they have already done to combat the coming 
freeze, they said. They spray with a plastic-like substance, run wind machines 
and sprinklers to keep the temperatures high, and fire up orchard heaters. 
</P>
<P>
They can further protect trees by wrapping them or shoveling dirt around their 
trunks, Schaeffer said. But how they handle their own orchards is an individual 
economic decision. 
</P>
<P>
"Do they concentrate the pots in the warmer areas and write off the other 
trees, or pay people to shovel dirt all night?" he asked. He is seeking advice 
from an agricultural expert at the University of Florida, where the citrus 
industry has weathered several severe freezes. 
</P>
<P>
Schaeffer said little if any rain or snow will come with the cold front that is 
moving toward the area, so the county will find no drought relief in the cold.

MALL WALKERS SHOP FOR NEW LEASE ON LIFE; 
</P>
<P>
THOUSAND OAKS: SENIOR CITIZENS STARTED DOING THEIR LAPS AT THE OAKS MALL ABOUT 
1 1/2 YEARS AGO.

Five hundred miles. To the 60- and 70-something generation who stroll with 
Elinor Welch through The Oaks Mall, the fact that the 67-year-old had walked 
the equivalent of 1,000 laps around the shopping center was simply incredible. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time I walked here, I thought I was never going to make it," Welch 
said one recent day, a patina of sweat on her forehead. More than 1 1/2 years 
ago, a few laps would make her legs and feet sore, and she was completely out 
of breath. 
</P>
<P>
"You just really knew you were out of shape," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Today, the gray-haired matron thinks nothing about the three miles or more she 
does around the mall every other day. She walks at a fast clip. 
</P>
<P>
There are no skinny dance instructors here, no loud music blaring from 
speakers. And most of the participants will admit that they haven't seen the 
latest aerobic fashions. 
</P>
<P>
But the climate-controlled mall has become a gymnasium for Mall Walkers, a 
sturdy group of seniors who organized more than 1 1/2 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of strolling leisurely, they stride, outfitted with shoes designed 
specifically for walking, pulse-counters and Walkmans, eyes pointed 
purposefully forward. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say walking is good for the heart and easier on the body than jogging. 
There is also a social element to fast-paced walking. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the gray-haired gliders exercise early in the morning before shoppers 
crowd the aisles. 
</P>
<P>
The 25 or so senior citizens who choose to make the mall their regular morning 
walk say they prefer the slick floors of the shopping center to the tree-lined 
paths of their own neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
"My neighborhood is not safe for me to walk in," Welch said. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer, air-conditioning cools the building; in the winter, there is 
insulation from freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
Some of them, such as Carleen Binkley, 66, do it to keep from getting bored. 
</P>
<P>
"I found out since retiring that you must keep active," said Binkley, a former 
school cafeteria worker. "It's an incentive to get up and get out. Even if you 
are by yourself, people will wave and say hello." 
</P>
<P>
Binkley and Laura Myszka, 66, can be seen every other morning doing laps at a 
fast 5 m.p.h. around the mall. Every lap is half a mile, and each completes at 
least two miles every other day. 
</P>
<P>
"We're the fastest," Myszka said. "They call us the speed demons." 
</P>
<P>
After logging nine miles a week, Myszka said, she was recently commended by her 
doctor. "He said it was the best thing I could be doing." 
</P>
<P>
A younger generation of walkers has also been drawn to the mall. One 
42-year-old said she comes each morning to exercise before working at her 
part-time job as an accountant. 
</P>
<P>
"I used to bike and run, but this is easier on my feet," Susan Atcherly said. 
"But these people make me feel positively lazy. Look at them go." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, most of the people who frequent the mall have become friends. They talk 
animatedly while working up a sweat. Others can be seen wearing the necklaces 
that proclaim them as 500- or 100-mile walkers. 
</P>
<P>
Afterward, some gather at a fast-food restaurant to drink coffee and plan 
excursions together. 
</P>
<P>
"There's old, and then there's old," Binkley said. "Here I think we're all 
young."

CITY WANTS SEAT ON ANNEXATION PANEL

<P>
The Ojai City Council is seeking a seat on the county commission that approves 
municipal boundaries at the same time the city is considering annexing more 
land. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Nina Shelley said the council's nomination of Councilman Robert McKinney 
to the Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission is its third try for a 
seat since the commission formed in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
Shelley said Ojai has the distinction of being the only city in the county that 
has not been represented on the commission, except for Moorpark, which 
incorporated in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
The council unsuccessfully nominated members to fill commission vacancies in 
1987 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The Local Agency Formation Commission is empowered by state law to review, 
approve or deny boundaries and spheres of influence for cities. 
</P>
<P>
It is made up of two city representatives chosen by the mayors of the 10 cities 
in Ventura County, two supervisors appointed by the County Board of Supervisors 
and a public member selected by the other commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley Councilwoman Vicky Howard's election to the Board of Supervisors 
will create a vacancy in January. Her term runs through May 5. 
</P>
<P>
The selection committee will meet Jan. 8 to appoint Howard's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Ojai City Council unanimously agreed to study the financial 
aspects of annexing surrounding areas to form a valleywide city. THIA BELL

2 HELD IN ROBBERY OF CONVENIENCE STORE

Two men suspected of robbing a Moorpark convenience store of beer Christmas 
morning were arrested after their revelry spurred neighbors to call police, 
authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
A disturbance at Park Spring Condominiums led to the arrest of Jeffrey James 
Taylor, 19, of Simi Valley and Gregory Raymond Wilson, 21, of Palmdale at 4:45 
a.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The pair were booked on suspicion of strong-armed robbery, Ventura County 
Sheriff's Sgt. Frank O'Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon said two men entered a convenience store in the 500 block of Los 
Angeles Avenue shortly after 2 a.m. O'Hanlon said they found the beer 
refrigerator locked, as required by law at 2 a.m., so each grabbed a 12-pack of 
warm beer from a display and ran from the store with the clerk chasing them. 
</P>
<P>
One man allegedly punched the clerk, and the pair then jumped into a white 
pickup truck and fled. 
</P>
<P>
Deputies Eric Hatlee and Bernie McMahon, responding to a disturbance call two 
hours later at the condominiums on Spring Road, saw Taylor and Wilson inside, 
O'Hanlon said, adding that the two men fit the description of the suspects. The 
deputies found the suspects' pickup parked outside and arrested them as they 
left the apartment. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon said the two men were identified by the clerk, who was treated for 
minor injuries. CHRISTOPHER PUMMER

AGGIES EAGER FOR HEISMAN TEST; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY BOWL: TEXAS A&amp;M HAS HAD MUCH SUCCESS AGAINST TROPHY WINNERS, 
WINNING THREE OF ITS LAST FOUR GAMES AGAINST HEISMAN WINNERS.

<P>
Your turn, Ty Detmer. 
</P>
<P>
Know this: Texas A&amp;M doesn't have a history of shivering and quaking at the 
site of Heisman Trophy winners. 
</P>
<P>
Ask Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Or Tim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Or Andre Ware. 
</P>
<P>
In the past six seasons, the Aggies have faced four Heisman winners and stopped 
three of them short of victory. 
</P>
<P>
Auburn and Bo Jackson were 36-16 losers in the 1985 Cotton Bowl. With the 
Aggies leading, 21-16, in the fourth quarter and Auburn at the Texas A&amp;M 
six, Bo was handed the ball four times in a row and didn't make it to the end 
zone. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame and Brown were 35-10 victims at the k1987 Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
Last season, Ware, Houston and the run and shoot were held to a season-low 
total offense in a 17-13 loss at A&amp;M's Kyle Field. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders, now a Detroit Lion and one of the NFL's top 
rushers, was the only recent Heisman success story against the Aggies. He 
gained 157 yards in a 52-15 Cowboy in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Now Detmer gets his chance to defend his Heisman honor against those who 
defense the Heisman so effectively. What do the Aggies have concocted to stop 
him in Saturday's Holiday Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like we've got a good plan, but a plan is only as good as the guys 
executing it," Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum said. "We'll have to wait and 
see whether it works or not." 
</P>
<P>
Executing the plan for the Aggies is linebacker William Thomas, who led the 
team with 13 sacks. He reads about Detmer a lot. He hears his name on the radio 
and sees him on television. He wouldn't mind putting him on his back a few 
times and getting in on a bit of the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
"I know there's going to be a lot of people watching Detmer in this game, and 
if I get to him a lot, then people will be watching me," Thomas said. "I think 
I can put a lot of pressure on him." 
</P>
<P>
In many ways, this is BYU's game. The Cougars have been here nine times in the 
bowl's 14 years. When they arrived at Lindbergh Field Tuesday, San Diegans kept 
approaching Coach LaVell Edwards and telling him how good it was go have BYU 
back. 
</P>
<P>
Nine times. It might be cheaper for Edwards to get himself a condo at Mission 
Beach rather than stay in a hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M has never played in this game. These guys don't know Mission 
Beach from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of our guys have never been to California," Slocum said. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies don't have a Heisman Trophy winner, either. Shoot, running back 
Darren Lewis, the nation's third-leading rusher, finished ninth in the 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
On that subject, he would like to make it known that he isn't sitting around 
sniveling over finishing so far back in the pack. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to get that cleared up right now," he said minutes after stepping off 
the plane into the USAir Hangar. "I thought I had two bad games this year, and 
by that happening, I can understand why I was so low in the Heisman balloting." 
</P>
<P>
So then, the offense. Texas A&amp;M doesn't exactly move the ball the way BYU 
does. Passing attack? Funny joke. Quarterback Bucky Richardson has thrown for 
847 yards. That's about a game and a half for Detmer. (Richardson shared time 
for eight of 12 games with Lance Pavlas, who is considered the better passer.) 
</P>
<P>
Slocum hired Bob Toledo to be his offensive coordinator before last season. 
Toledo, who coached at Oregon for six years, is a guy who likes to run a 
pro-style offense. Slocum wouldn't mind using that offense either, and that 
might help attract more national recruits. 
</P>
<P>
But this year, Texas A&amp;M has Lewis. And Richardson. This is no time to be 
getting too fancy. Passing at College Station this year would have been like 
packing a wool sweater for a summer trip to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
"I think any coach that's going to be worth a darn has got to adjust to his 
personnel," Toledo said. "And that's what we did. If I had my druthers, I'd 
want to throw the football. But it doesn't make sense (this year)." 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M might be meat and potatoes, but the Aggies (8-3-1) are still 
legitimate. They have won four of their past five, and the one loss was to No. 
4 Texas, 28-27, in the last game of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
If a common opponent means anything, A&amp;M opened its season with a 28-13 
victory at Hawaii. BYU concluded its season at Hawaii in front of a national 
television audience and lost, 59-28. Detmer threw four interceptions. That 
deflated a lot of the excitement surrounding his Heisman victory. 
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who gained 1,691 yards in 291 attempts, is the focal point of A&amp;M's 
offense, but Richardson also transports the ball efficiently. He averaged 6.9 
yards in 97 carries and, Slocum says, has a great knack for turning upfield. 
</P>
<P>
The Aggies have a strong, experienced offensive line that has made it a little 
easier for Lewis and Richardson to stockpile their impressive statistics. 
Center Mike Arthur was a semifinalist for the Outland Trophy, and offensive 
tackle Mike Pappas was a first-team All-Southwest Conference player. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M doesn't slouch on defense, either. The Aggies have allowed 
opponents an average of 18.2 points this season, and they finished 19th in the 
nation in team defense. Leading this group are Thomas, chosen the SWC defensive 
player of the year by the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, and cornerback Kevin Smith, 
A&amp;M's career interception leader with 18. 
</P>
<P>
And finally, there is the 12th man. In case you haven't heard the story, it 
dates back to January, 1922. A student named E. King Gill was helping in the 
press box at a game between A&amp;M and Centre College. The Aggies had a host 
of injuries, and Gill was called down to put on the uniform of an injured 
player and be ready in case he was needed. Actually, Gill wasn't your average 
bookworm. He played on the basketball team and had been a member of the 
football team earlier. Anyway, Gill stood under the stands for the remainder of 
the game but was never put in. 
</P>
<P>
Today, to uphold that tradition, Texas A&amp;M invites anyone from the student 
body to try out for the kickoff coverage team for home games. Statistically, 
the team has been more effective in recent years than the regular Aggies on the 
road, and this group was consistently good again this season. 
</P>
<P>
But the members of the 12th man kickoff coverage team will only be spectators 
Saturday. With all the overtime hours being put in to detonate Detmer, it was 
decided there wasn't time to prepare the 12th man. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently, there were no hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
"They're comfortable with that," graduate assistant Blair Philbrick said. 
"Those guys are a bunch of overachievers." 
</P>
<P>
Just so the Aggies beat Detmer and BYU.

USIU TEAM CAUGHT IN STORM; 
</P>
<P>
REACTIONS: MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM MUST PLAY ON AMID REPORTS OF FINANCIAL 
TROUBLES AT THE SCHOOL.

U.S. International University's men's basketball team is scheduled to practice 
today at its usual time, 2 p.m., and place, a warehouse in Poway. Coach Gary 
Zarecky said he expects all 11 of his players to be there. The Gulls will 
loosen up and run through the usual drills in preparation for the next three 
games, all at home, on the 1990-91 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
But because of the sudden, grim possibility that USIU might not play the 1991 
part of its season, this practice will likely turn into a prayer session. And 
Zarecky, who has built a reputation as motivator, will have to out-do himself. 
</P>
<P>
USIU had struggled through a dismal 1-10 start amid rumors that the school was 
broke. Friday, less than three hours before the Gulls were to open the US Air 
Tournament against Murray State, the players were called into an unscheduled 
meeting in their hotel in Dayton, Ohio, and told the rumors were fact. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier that day, the university filed for bankruptcy. The players were 
stunned. They didn't need a lecture about what it meant. As part of what school 
officials called an "economic reorganization," athletic sports programs at USIU 
are expected to undergo substantial cuts and could be eliminated completely. 
That includes the focal point of the school's 12-sport Division I program: 
men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a lot of tears in the locker room (before USIU's 103-55 loss to 
Murray State), because they were afraid," Zarecky said Monday. "These are young 
men; they're down." 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, USIU's board of trustees, after reviewing proposals from 
administrators, will render a decision on the future of all extracurricular 
programs -- with particular focus on athletics and arts. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky and his players have been assured of a few things: They will play their 
scheduled home games against New Orleans on Thursday and Baylor on Saturday, 
and no matter what happens, scholarships will be honored through the school 
year. What they fear most is that the season could end 13 games short, along 
with the college careers of three players, including one of the nation's 
premier scorers, guard Kevin Bradshaw. 
</P>
<P>
"Devastating" was one word Zarecky used to describe the team's experience over 
the weekend. The other was "overwhelming." In the 48-point loss to Murray 
State, the Gulls' worst of the season, USIU had its lowest-scoring half (17 
points) and game (55) in Zarecky's five-plus years as coach. The following 
night, the Gulls were beaten, 98-56, by Stephen F. Austin, Zarecky's 100th 
college loss. 
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered, the team boarded a commerical flight bound for home, and it was 
delayed for 2 1/2 hours on the runway at Dayton International Airport. By the 
time they arrived in San Diego 14 hours later, it was early Sunday morning, and 
some of the players discovered their luggage had been misrouted. It was still 
missing on Christmas Eve. 
</P>
<P>
At 5:30 p.m. Sunday, Bradshaw, whose season has been partly dedicated to 
getting attention from the NBA, got married. 
</P>
<P>
What will happen next is unknown, except that the Gulls will be heavy underdogs 
in both of their upcoming games at home, where the attendance averaged in the 
low 200s this season. 
</P>
<P>
USIU Athletic Director Al Palmiotto said he presented "several proposals" last 
week that will be reviewed by the university's interim president, Kenneth 
McLennan, who will make his recommendation to the trustees Friday. Palmiotto 
would not reveal details except to say that costs would be cut. 
</P>
<P>
He said the school would suffer if athletics are lost. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky, 53-100 at USIU, said he already operates with "the smallest Division I 
basketball budget in the country" and has helped keep the program alive through 
his own fund-raising. The Gulls had their best season under Zarecky in 1989-90, 
finishing 12-16, ninth best among the nation's Division I independents. Before 
this season, Zarecky said he believed USIU was ready for its first winning 
season since it was 13-12 in 1980-81. 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky also said he has not been paid in two months and that there was a 
previous payless period of three months. And he said he was as shaken as his 
players after TV reporters in Dayton dubbed the USIU "a team without a school" 
and the Gulls were deluged with "Hi, mom, send money" references. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been motivated for six years at USIU by all the adversity and negativisms 
and sneering," he said. "I've been motivated to prove people wrong. Now things 
are happening that are out of my control. 
</P>
<P>
"Things were happening on campus from the classroom and from the other students 
that were just completely getting my players out of focus. In my own case, the 
uncertaintly of not knowing what was going on for the last four or five months 
really affected my coaching. 
</P>
<P>
"And when you throw in the fact I haven't been paid, it's made it tough on my 
family. I'm not sure I'm going to have a job. And I've never been out of work. 
I'm not afraid of it. It's just an unpleasantry, and it couldn't have hit at a 
worse time. You're talking Christmas time." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said clear lines have been drawn on campus between pro- and anti-sports 
factions. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody's fighting for their lives right now," he said. "There's a lot of 
guns on the academic side being aimed at athletics. And on the other side of 
campus, you've got people who know that you're not going to have a viable 
undergraduate university if you don't offer . . . athletics." 
</P>
<P>
Today, when Zarecky walks into that warehouse and faces his players, he knows 
he can't wear his emotions on the sleeve of his warmup jacket. In these 
troubled, shark-infested waters, he must remain afloat. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to put this phone down, walk away from my desk and think, 'God, you 
know, I'm a winner,' " he said. "I want to sound up, because that's the way I 
have to be."

PLAYOFF PICTURE IS STILL UNCLEAR

<P>
The Raiders have clinched a playoff spot, but their first-round opponent is far 
from being determined. If the Raiders defeat San Diego this Sunday and win the 
AFC West, they will receive a bye along with Buffalo and then wait for the 
outcome of two first-round games involving the three wild-card teams and the 
AFC Central Division champion. 
</P>
<P>
Because Buffalo has clinched the conference's best record, it is guaranteed a 
first-round game against the remaining wild-card team with the worst record. 
</P>
<P>
A quick review of the new format: The division winner with the worst record, 
which will be the eventual AFC Central champion, will play host to the 
wild-card team with the worst record, leaving a game between the wild-card 
teams with the two best records. Those teams would be Kansas City and Miami at 
the moment. 
</P>
<P>
Kansas City needs to defeat the Chicago Bears at Soldier Field this Saturday to 
remain alive for the AFC West title. The Chiefs received a motivational break 
when the New York Giants won Sunday and clinched the second first-round bye in 
the NFC along with San Francisco. It renders Saturday's game against Kansas 
City meaningless for the NFC Central champion Bears, who are destined to play a 
first-round game as the divisional winner with the poorest record. CHRIS

BIG NAMES IN ABOVE THE RIM TOURNAMENT 
</P>

<P>
The third- and 18th-ranked teams in the nation are going to face each other in 
the first Above the Rim Hoopwear Classic at Torrey Pines High School. 
</P>
<P>
Not a bad championship matchup, except that the two teams, Jersey City (N.J.) 
St. Anthony and Camden (N.J.) are meeting in tonight's first round. 
</P>
<P>
March-type madness in December, you ask? 
</P>
<P>
It's John Farrell's baby. The Torrey Pines boys' basketball coach is hoping 
that San Diego, a city that just can't seem to get behind professional or 
college basketball, will be a showcase for the nation's finest high school 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The point we're trying to get across is that it is a national tournament," 
Farrell said. "We want to make it so that, hypothetically, you have a national 
champion coming out of it, so that if you win it, you have some bragging 
rights." 
</P>
<P>
In a stroke of scheduling genius, the 11-team tournament originally included 
three teams ranked in the top 20, according to the Street and Smith poll. Since 
the season began, a fourth team has joined the top and Miami Senior, previously 
the 19th-ranked team, joined two other teams in the top 10, at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
Before the most recent rankings, the tournament had the most top 20 teams of 
any tournament in the country. It already has gotten better without even 
playing a game. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to prove ourselves on running the tournament, but we have the best 
field if you look at the top 20," Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
Southern Section power Anaheim Mater Dei already has committed to play next 
year, when the field expands to 16 teams. So has Fairdale, Ky. Farrell has also 
talked to Dematha High in Hyattsville, Md. 
</P>
<P>
"I feel the more you play good teams, the more the level of competition in San 
Diego will get better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Farrell took his team to Fort Myers, Fla., to compete in one of 
these super tournaments. That year, they won the San Diego Section Division II 
title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the community has a smorgasbord of basketball coming up," Farrell 
said. "I don't think you can find a better high school format this year. This 
will be a real treat if you like basketball." 
</P>
<P>
The marquee schools are No. 2 St. Raymond from the Bronx, N.Y., No. 3 St. 
Anthony, No. 9 Miami Senior, and No. 18 Camden. 
</P>
<P>
St. Raymond (7-0), winner of the Illolani McDonald's Classic in Hawaii, begins 
play Thursday against Deep Creek, Va. (3-1). The Chesapeake school, second in 
the state last year, has Alonzo Mourning as an alumnus, and features guard Gary 
Taylor, Street and Smith All-America honorable mention. 
</P>
<P>
St. Raymond (7-0) returns four starters from a 15-10 team that will be 
bolstered by its 27-1 New York City junior varsity championship team. Three 
players, 6-6 forward Orlando Antigua, Terrence Rencher and Tyler Brown also 
were honorable mention players. 
</P>
<P>
St. Anthony (3-1) was 28-4 last season and returns four honorable mention 
players, 6-6 center Rodrick Rhodes, Danny Hurley, Jermaine Womack and sophomore 
Jalil Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
Camden (3-0), St. Anthony's opponent tonight (6 p.m.), was 25-5 last year. 
Coach Clarence Turner started the season with a 493-73 career record, including 
seven New Jersey state championships through 20 years. They boast senior 
forward Keith Carmichael and junior guard Greg Barr. 
</P>
<P>
Miami Senior (8-1) was 30-3 last year and won the 4-A state championship. It 
has won three of the past four state titles and won its final 25 games. It 
reached the finals of the recent Ocala Tournament. Steve Edwards, a 6-6 
guard/forward, was voted one of the top five junior prospects at the Nike 
National Basketball Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Two San Diego teams, Lincoln (5-5) and Valhalla (8-1), open the tournament with 
a 2:45 p.m. game. Miami Senior plays at 4:30 p.m. against Las Vegas Bonanza 
(8-2), a state finalist the past three years; and Torrey Pines (8-1) closes the 
tournament tonight at 8 p.m. against Monsignor McClancy (5-3), which returns 
four starters from last year's 12-7 Class B Catholic state champion. 
</P>
<P>
Payson, Utah, (4-3) finished fifth in the state last year and plays the winner 
of the Miami Senior-Bonanza game at 8 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
The three local teams are excited about facing some of the country's best 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
Valhalla Coach Manny Silva, whose Norsemen are two-time defending Grossmont 2-A 
champs, said the experience should be an eye-opening one for his players, and a 
good measuring stick for his program. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're in a competitive sport, you want to know what the best is like," 
Silva said. "You want to see how your kids compare with other kids around the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
Ron Loneski starts four juniors on his Lincoln team, and he thinks the 
tournament only can help his five-time defending Central League championship 
team improve. 
</P>
<P>
"To be successful, you have to want to be good," Loneski said. "Exposure to 
these other teams will show our kids what it takes to be good basketball 
players. . . . That's why Morse is so good, (Coach) Ron Davis takes his players 
to Los Angeles every year and doesn't worry about his record." 
</P>
<P>
But Farrell doesn't think that it's just a showcase for the visiting teams. 
</P>
<P>
"The other thing is we're also showing the rest of the country a little of San 
Diego basketball," he said. "I don't want to take away from that. We want to 
gain their respect, too." 
</P>
<P>
This definitely is their chance.

TOLLIVER'S BENCHING IS CALLED A LESSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Henning, coach of the San Diego Chargers, says the benching of Billy Joe 
Tolliver for the season finale against the Raiders at the Coliseum should be 
taken as a message by the entire team. 
</P>
<P>
"Position by position, we're looking for the right guys," Henning said. "Some 
of those that are (on the team) now may not be the right guys." 
</P>
<P>
Henning said that rookie John Friesz will start Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Tolliver threw crucial interceptions late in the fourth quarter of consecutive 
losses to the Denver Broncos and Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Tolliver has a future as a quarterback in this league and can win," 
Henning said. "He has gotten to the point where he does many things far and 
above from what you'd expect a second-year quarterback to be able to do in his 
development. But he still has a track record in the last part of the game in a 
number of situations of not making the play that has to be made." 
</P>
<P>
To Pittsburgh Steeler quarterback Bubby Brister, there is nothing like a dome. 
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, Brister played one of the best games in his career, passing a 
5-11 Steelers' team to a 37-34 upset in Houston that helped knock the Oilers 
out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, after Houston beat Pittsburgh twice in the regular season, Brister 
directed the Steelers to a 26-23 overtime upset in Houston in the AFC wild card 
game. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, the Steelers (9-6) and Oilers (8-7) meet in the Astrodome to 
decide the AFC Central championship. 
</P>
<P>
"I like it in domes," Brister said. "The ball travels true and you don't have 
to worry about bad weather." 
</P>
<P>
After struggling with his weight for years, the Chicago Bears' William Perry 
seems to have it under control. 
</P>
<P>
His improved play is one of the reasons the Bears are 11-4. The slim-downed 
Perry, officially listed at 325 pounds, is moving more quickly -- and is sixth 
on the team in solo tackles with 37.

IT'S THE SEASON TO GO FISHING FOR MARLIN OFF CABO SAN LUCAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS and RICH ROBERTS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Those spending the holidays in Cabo San Lucas are discovering this is the best 
time to go fishing. Conditions are ideal -- no crowds and lots of marlin. 
</P>
<P>
"Fishing is excellent but business, it's the other side of the coin," said 
LaWanda Josephson of the Tortuga Finistera Fleet. 
</P>
<P>
Striped marlin fishing is "red-hot," according to the fleet's owner, Darrell 
Primrose. 
</P>
<P>
Primrose said the hotel boats in the area -- most are fishing off the Cabo 
Falso Lighthouse -- are averaging three to five stripers a day. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Paster of Los Angeles fished for three days aboard the Tortuga II, 
catching and releasing 14 marlin. 
</P>
<P>
For variety's sake, dorado ranging from 10 to 40 pounds are readily striking 
trolled lures. 
</P>
<P>
What do marlin eat? 
</P>
<P>
The December issue of Salt Water Sportsman magazine has an interview with Wayne 
Witzell, a biologist with the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric 
Administration in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Witzell told writer Larry Larsen that in his years on the water -- from 
Massachusetts to Texas, throughout the Caribbean and the Bahamas -- he has 
learned that marlin are not as discriminating as he had previously thought. 
</P>
<P>
Once he watched a 125-pound blue marlin trying to attack a porcupine fish that 
had inflated itself to dissuade the marlin. 
</P>
<P>
Larsen's description: "The unfortunate porcupine fish had puffed itself up to 
about one foot in diameter and was bobbing on the surface, while beneath it the 
dark shadow of the marlin circled. 
</P>
<P>
"The blue eventually moved up underneath the porcupine fish and began whacking 
it with its bill. The inflated fish was batted into the air three or four times 
as the marlin continued its harassment." 
</P>
<P>
The marlin finally gave up as Witzell moved his boat in for a closer look. 
</P>
<P>
Sampling tournament-caught blue marlin, Witzell has found in their stomachs 
huge quantities of deep sea squid, some as long as three feet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not unusual to find 50 or 100 squid beaks, which look like little parrot 
beaks, in the stomach of a blue (marlin)," he told Larsen. 
</P>
<P>
Dolphinfish and skipjack tuna to 10 pounds are a common part of the marlin's 
diet. 
</P>
<P>
Not so common: The foot-long swordfish -- estimated to be about 40 days old -- 
found inside the stomach of a 390-pound blue marlin that was caught in the 
Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, Witzell said, a 400-pound blue marlin had swallowed a 
three-foot white marlin. The blue had the whole 40-pound white marlin in its 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
Ralph Rosenlund of Portland, Ore., recommends that Americans planning to tour 
Europe in a recreational vehicle ship one over and sell it there afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"It costs only $700 to ship one but $1,000 to $1,500 a week to rent one," 
Rosenlund said. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenlund and his wife Nancy have written a 450-page guide: "Travel Europe With 
Your Motor Home." They will be at the 26th annual Anaheim Sports, Vacation 
&amp; RV Show Jan. 5 through Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Along with the usual fishing, hunting and adventure activities, the show will 
feature outdoor products. 
</P>
<P>
Show hours: Saturdays noon-10 p.m., Sundays noon-6 p.m., weekdays 2-10 p.m. 
Admission: adults $6.95, children ages 6-15 $2.25, under 6 free and seniors $5 
on weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Briefly 
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
"Now I must sleep, so tomorrow I can be strong," wrote Olga Benario to her 
husband and daughter from a Nazi concentration camp on the last night of her 
life. "I kiss you both for the last time." 
</P>
<P>
Olga Benario, the daughter of a middle-class lawyer from Munich, thrust herself 
into the most treacherous currents of revolutionary struggle. 
</P>
<P>
At 14 she joined the Communist Party. She was still a teen-ager when she 
liberated her lover from a German prison at gunpoint and fled to Moscow. She 
was sent to South America to start a revolution. But her life ended, by a 
poignant twist of fate, in a concentration camp. 
</P>
<P>
Fernando Morais, Benario's self-appointed biographer, persuades us that her 
hunger for adventure, her sheer force of character, her passion and courage, 
called her to a strange and tragic destiny. As depicted in "Olga," she was a 
strong and beautiful woman, a hero in the very best sense of the word, but a 
doomed hero. 
</P>
<P>
The book focuses on the zenith in the arc of her life. She was dispatched by 
the Comintern to Brazil in 1935 in the company of Luis Carlos Prestes, another 
impossibly romantic figure who was Moscow's best hope for triggering a 
revolution in Latin America. They traveled in the guise of a rich young couple, 
well supplied with cash and clothing to keep up the pretense, and even managed 
a sumptuous "honeymoon" in New York before landing by seaplane on the coast of 
Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
"May 1935 be the year of revolution in Brazil," Prestes toasted his comrade and 
lover. 
</P>
<P>
As it turned out, the elaborate plot was stillborn: "The revolution 'began' at 
3 a.m.," Morais explains, "and was over by 1:30 p.m. that afternoon." The 
Brazilian secret police, assisted by the Gestapo, rounded up the usual suspects 
and broke them under hideous torture. Soon enough, the story of Olga Benario 
turns from high-spirited revolutionary adventure to a descent into the maw of 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
Benario was a Jew, a Bolshevik, and a wanted criminal in Nazi Germany. The 
Brazilian police did not torture her; they offered her as a gift to Adolf 
Hitler. The fact that she carried the baby of a Brazilian citizen did not save 
her, nor did the heroic protests of her fellow prisoners. Her heroism and 
courage were put to a different test from the one for which she had prepared. 
</P>
<P>
History has provided Morais with settings and incidents fit for a Hollywood 
movie. Benario carries an ivory-handled revolver. The Brazilian police make 
cynical use of Prestes' faithful dog to search out and identify the couple in 
hiding. A police interrogator -- blond and German-speaking -- asks no questions 
at all; rather, he impassively cracks and eats hazelnuts until, suddenly, he 
crushes a suspect's thumb in the nutcracker. The only clue to Benario's 
ultimate fate is one word on a slip of paper sewn into the hem of her skirt: 
Bernburg, the site of a Nazi gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
Morais is a Brazilian journalist who now serves as minister of culture for the 
province of Sao Paolo. "Olga" is clearly his passion -- as the woman herself 
was in the lives of so many other men -- and he spent years in search of her 
exotic but elusive story. 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, he found a rich vein of once-secret information in the National 
Archives in Washington, thanks to the complicity of U.S. agents in suppressing 
the Prestes conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
The saga of Olga Benario, while muscle-bound with facts, in Morais' hands is 
aflame with the telltale glow of an author who has fallen hopelessly in love 
with his subject. Morais tells Benario's story so vividly, so convincingly, 
that we can readily understand why.

YEARLY CHRISTMAS BIRD COUNT BREAKS RECORD AT BONELLI PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
In the weeks before Christmas, most people spent their early Saturday mornings 
nestled snug in their beds or roaming the shopping malls with visions of the 
perfect gifts dancing in their heads. 
</P>
<P>
But Milt Blatt and an intrepid group of San Gabriel Valley residents went 
tramping through scrub brush and dreaming of tufted ducks, loggerhead shrikes 
and red-tailed hawks. 
</P>
<P>
Armed not with shopping bags and credit cards but with birding field guides and 
binoculars, members of the Pomona Valley Audubon Society were up before dawn 
earlier this month, canvassing the waters and back roads of Frank G. Bonelli 
County Regional Park in preparation for their annual Christmas bird count. 
</P>
<P>
In a precount expedition Dec. 12, Blatt, a retired U.S. Navy civilian employee 
from West Covina, led a party of three men and two women. As Blatt strode 
through the park, he cocked his head intently, stopping at the grass near the 
edge of Puddingstone Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
"Hear that chirping? That's the Say's phoebe," Blatt announced to the group of 
retirees who were hurrying to keep up with his long-legged strides. He listened 
to another faint chirp and stopped dead in his tracks. "Excuse me -- black 
phoebe! For gosh sakes, I'm getting up too early in the morning these days," he 
exclaimed with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
Novice birder Beverly Pemberton of Claremont laughed back. "He could tell me it 
was anything, and I'd believe it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Blatt, who has led the Bonelli count since 1978, said last year's total of 89 
species sighted in the park was a record. This year, the birders on Dec. 15 set 
a new record, counting 93 species at Bonelli Park and 145 within a 15-mile 
radius of Claremont. 
</P>
<P>
The local count is part of a much broader effort. By Jan. 3, more than 42,000 
intrepid birders will raise their binoculars from Alaska to Brazil to count the 
winged creatures migrating across the Americas. Their totals will be published 
in a special edition of the National Audubon Society's birding magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Chris Martin met her husband, Jack, on a birding trip nine years ago. "It's 
great to see wildlife and natural things, and it's enjoyable learning to tell 
the birds apart," said Martin, of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
Serious birders, such as Blatt, carry powerful spotting scopes and tripods that 
bring small birds hundreds of yards away into close, sharp focus. That kind of 
close-up view is necessary because minuscule details, such as whether a beak is 
yellow-orange or yellow-green, can separate one species from another. Blatt 
records the birds he has seen in a tiny notebook bound with a rubber band and 
filled with black script. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a California towhee," Blatt said, pointing to a bird perched on a 
telephone wire. "Used to be called the brown towhee, but they changed the 
name." 
</P>
<P>
Within the first half-hour of the birding expedition, Blatt had called out the 
names of two dozen species. "11 o'clock -- there's a Western grebe," he said. 
"Two o'clock -- you've got a Clark's grebe." 
</P>
<P>
The coveted sighting of the day, however, was a shy wanderer from Asia -- a 
rare tufted duck that Blatt had spotted on a visit to Bonelli earlier in the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
For several of Blatt's birders, the tufted duck would be a "life bird," a 
once-in-a-lifetime sighting that could be recorded on a detailed list of 
sightings that serious birders prize. 
</P>
<P>
As the group made its way slowly around the park, discussing rare finds, the 
best habitat for bird sightings and the scholarly names for birds, they also 
talked about their opposition to proposed commercial development of Bonelli 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
"This place is kind of a jewel, an oasis for people to come and see what open 
space looks like," Blatt said, noting how much open space has disappeared from 
Southern California since he moved here in 1944. Over the dozen years that he 
has led the count at Bonelli Park, Blatt said, he has seen some species drop 
off his census list. 
</P>
<P>
"There used to be a cow pasture north of Brackett Air Field, and I got prairie 
falcons there. But they've developed a business center there so those birds are 
gone," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Other birds have dropped out of sight as various streams and ponds in the park 
were filled in for recreational uses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"See, to most people this looks like empty, barren space," Blatt said, 
indicating a cactus- and scrub-covered hillside. "But ecologically, it's a 
community for mammals, birds and insects."

SCENE ON THE STREET EAR THEY GO AGAIN

Some earrings make a whisper of a fashion statement. Single pearls. Teensy gold 
hearts. Discreet silver circles. Heck, you pull off your sweater and you don't 
even know if they're still in your ears or have burrowed into the cable stitch. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are EARRINGS. These are fashion statements that carry across the 
room -- some of them in a shout that's, well, almost earsplitting. 
</P>
<P>
If you want to see EARRINGS, try the streets and malls of Pasadena and West 
Covina, where they are much in evidence. And among the young, the dramatic 
effect of one earring is duplicated, or in some cases enhanced, with one or 
more earrings. 
</P>
<P>
Women who believe that lobe makes the world go round put all the focus just on 
one ear. And women who refuse to let fashion lead them by the nose can also 
prove it. SYBIL BAKER

IS THERE A LIMIT TO SALARIES?; 
</P>
<P>
BASEBALL: BANKRUPTCY FOR A MAJOR LEAGUE TEAM IS CONSIDERED POSSIBLE BY SOME 
EXECUTIVES BECAUSE OF THE COST OF FREE AGENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The 1990 baseball free-agent auction is nearly over, a hyperactive exercise in 
free enterprise. Along the way, contracts worth millions of dollars were 
bestowed upon great and mediocre players. 
</P>
<P>
In one 30-day stretch between November and December, 29 players were signed to 
contracts totaling $209 million, at an annual average salary of $2.4 million 
for an average of three years. 
</P>
<P>
In neon, the figures flashed across the tote boards of the national pastime: 
Darryl Strawberry for $20.2 million! George Bell for $9.8 million! Franklin 
Stubbs for $6 million! Matt Young for $6.4 million? 
</P>
<P>
If ownership's apparent desire to mug itself so willingly leads fans to assume 
that surely the money must be there, there is another way to look at baseball's 
increasingly bizarre balance sheet: What if a team went broke trying to pay the 
free-agent freight? 
</P>
<P>
It's not so strange a thought. Sure, there are still three years left on CBS' 
and ESPN's $1.46-billion deals, which gives each owner about $14 million 
annually. Sure, baseball attendance keeps breaking records. 
</P>
<P>
But with so much money being spent so freely, the idea that one day a 
ballclub's salary expenses may so exceed its revenues that it could go broke is 
not out of reason's realm. 
</P>
<P>
"I think you might have more than one team go bankrupt and no buyer out there 
willing to take the responsibility for it," says General Manager Al Rosen of 
the San Francisco Giants, who in the last month committed $33 million of owner 
Bob Lurie's money to lure pitchers Bud Black and Dave Righetti and outfielder 
Willie McGee to Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
Lurie had previously made commitments totaling $30 million to Will Clark and 
Kevin Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd hope it wouldn't come to bankruptcy," says Bob Quinn, general manager of 
the Cincinnati Reds. "But knowing (baseball's) history, it might have to come 
to it. We always come close to the brink before taking action." 
</P>
<P>
The question to answer over the next few years -- assuming a continuing salary 
spiral that could produce an average player salary of $1 million, from the 
current $597,000 -- is this: Would a team's bankruptcy make a dent in the 
skyrocketing salaries? 
</P>
<P>
"It would certainly be a rare occasion for a sports club to go bankrupt," says 
the Kansas City Royals' president, Joe Burke. "But you know, I don't even know 
if a bankruptcy would stop the salary spiral." 
</P>
<P>
Says Lurie: "If a club went bankrupt tomorrow, I don't even know if it would 
matter. Teams would say, 'It's your problem, not ours.' " 
</P>
<P>
If Lurie is right, it is even more likely that little sympathy would come from 
the players' side. After all, the players' association has proved highly 
unsympathetic to the owners when they cry poverty. 
</P>
<P>
Agent Jack Sands, who negotiated a two-year, $2.2-million deal for Willie 
Wilson on Dec. 3 that shifted him from Kansas City to Oakland, says: 
"Bankruptcy won't happen. But if it does, the players wouldn't say the party's 
over, the owners were right and let's give back the family jewels." 
</P>
<P>
Sands insists that a team owner on the brink of bankruptcy would find willing 
buyers, especially in the four cities recently eliminated from consideration as 
expansion-team sites. "The commissioner won't let a team go broke," Sands adds. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, a team going belly-up would not be a Chapter 11 bankruptcy. If no 
successor owner loomed in the wings, the team would be handed over to the 
league to operate and sell. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to talk about a team going broke," says Deputy Commissioner Steve 
Greenberg. "But to remain competitive on the field, you have to compete for 
talent. Some teams will have to make a decision to lose millions of dollars by 
signing players or to compete with less expensive, less experienced players, 
which means you don't compete. Going broke is an extreme, and a rational person 
would hopefully choose to go with a skeleton crew." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the sight of an owner filing a bankruptcy petition at federal court is 
unlikely, though, it is probable that some financial woes will descend upon 
some, maybe even many teams, for several reasons. Increased salaries are the 
obvious culprit. Payrolls of $30 million will soon be common, and revenues must 
flow in if those obligations are to be met. 
</P>
<P>
And consider the future financial stability that seemed assured with the 
CBS-ESPN contracts that expire after the 1993 season. Some teams barely put 
their hands on the cash before handing much of it right over to the players. 
</P>
<P>
"That TV money went through us like ships passing in the night," says Pirate 
President Carl Barger. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, for instance, will pay $17.7 million to their five free-agent 
signees this season, $3.7 more than the club's share of the TV riches. The 
Athletics have far exceeded their annual national TV booty with their 
re-signings of Jose Canseco, Dave Stewart, Dave Henderson, Bob Welch, Dennis 
Eckersley and Rickey Henderson. 
</P>
<P>
Not to be ignored in the equation is the effect of the $280-million collusion 
penalty levied against owners earlier this year for rigging the free-agent 
markets in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Each team will pay $10.76 million to the 
players' association in installments over 15 months, starting Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
Also of concern to some recently purchased teams, such as the Texas Rangers and 
Seattle Mariners, is the cost of paying bank loans used to finance some of the 
acquisition costs. 
</P>
<P>
"Some teams will have to make some very difficult decisions," says Jeff 
Smulyan, part owner of the Mariners, who adds that the Mariners' debt is not 
onerous. "I don't see a bankruptcy happening, but you could see some economic 
misery." 
</P>
<P>
Owners in small markets certainly have the greatest reason for financial 
concern, especially when they see how much more in TV-and-radio rights fees 
their big-market brethren receive. How can the have-nots, with no more than $5 
million to $7 million in broadcast fees, play the free-agent sweepstakes game 
when the haves play the sport with $15 million to $50 million? 
</P>
<P>
Well, in some cases, they can. Take the peculiar case of the Royals, with only 
$5 million in rights fees. Weep not for the Royals -- at least as long as owner 
Ewing Kauffman is there. Kauffman is a generous, civic-minded septuagenarian 
who built a billion-dollar fortune in pharmaceuticals. He wants to win so badly 
that he will spend obscenely to make Kansas City proud. 
</P>
<P>
So what if bestowing millions of dollars last year on pitchers Mark Davis and 
Storm Davis proved to be a bust? Since November, he has signed pitcher Mike 
Boddicker for three years at $9.25 million, outfielder-designated hitter Kirk 
Gibson for two years at $3.3 million, and left-hander Dan Schatzeder for a year 
at $700,000. 
</P>
<P>
"We thank the good Lord every day Mr. Kauffman's here," Burke says. "He's not 
operating the ballclub for his own profit. We lost money in 1990 and we've 
assured him we'll lose money in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
So profoundly does Kauffman want to win that he does what other fabulously 
well-to-do owners won't: He subsidizes player signings with his own cash. 
</P>
<P>
Says Burke: "We can't compete with other teams as far as our income, so we have 
to have an owner willing to spend his own money. We don't pass higher salary 
costs on to the fans. We pass it on to Mr. Kauffman." 
</P>
<P>
In Pittsburgh, however, the thought of going back to the team's partners is 
unconscionable, says Barger. 
</P>
<P>
"They won't subsidize the team," he says. "We won't go back to them for 
operating capital." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, when the Pirates' bill for future free-agents Bobby Bonilla and Andy 
Van Slyke comes due next year and the bill for Barry Bonds and Doug Drabek 
comes due in 1992, Barger will play with fiscal fire if they pay all four what 
they're worth, or community fire if they let their corps of stars depart. 
Already, the Pirates have allowed free-agents Sid Bream and R.J. Reynolds to 
leave for the Braves and Japan, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
"If I said every one of our players will be with us, I'd be frivolous," Barger 
says. "We have a strategy that we hope will keep us competitive." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, small-market teams such as the Pirates, Braves, Royals and Reds must 
find ways to resist the impulse to bid on free agents the way such big-market 
giants as the Dodgers, Angels and Mets do. Developing a productive minor league 
system is certainly the alternative, but free agents are so tempting when a 
team has a hole tailor-made for the right free-agent veteran. 
</P>
<P>
The Reds' Quinn has a quaint credo -- "Know when to say when!" -- when costs 
butt up against need. Having lost pitcher Danny Jackson, Quinn re-signed 
pitcher Tom Browning for four years at $12.5 million, and second baseman Bill 
Doran for three years at $7.3 million, then chased Zane Smith around the 
financial bases -- but stopped when he felt Smith's agent manipulating the Reds 
to jack up the Pirates' offer. 
</P>
<P>
"Sanity comes in when you hang up the phone," says Quinn. "I said, 'Consider 
the click of the phone your answer.' We know our fiscal restraints, but you 
have to be man enough to live by them." 
</P>
<P>
Still, adding $19.5 million in new salaries (while shedding Jackson's 
$1.15-million 1990 contract) does not presage the dawn of austerity. 
</P>
<P>
Both players and owners are looking toward a newly named joint economic study 
committee to sort out the future of player compensation. Earlier this year, 
during the 32-day spring training lockout of players, owners proposed a 
revenue-sharing plan. The players balked and the owners shelved the idea. 
</P>
<P>
Any type of revenue-sharing -- modeled partly on the NBA's revenue-sharing and 
salary cap system -- must mediate the disparities in local TV-and-radio income 
between the rich and poor clubs. Persuading the Yankees to pool their 
$50-million-plus in annual rights fees with teams getting $5 million will 
surely be difficult for the have-not owners. 
</P>
<P>
The question now is whether the study committee, whose members include Paul 
Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, can resolve the knotty 
compensation issues that have roiled baseball's management-labor relations. 
</P>
<P>
Well, Volcker wrung inflation out of the national economy in the 1980s. Maybe 
he can find a way to solve baseball's salary inflation in the 1990s.

ROSE: CHICO FRALEY, A BIG PART OF WASHINGTON'S DEFENSE, WAS FORTUNATE TO AVOID 
SERIOUS INJURY IN CAR CRASH.

<P>
It was almost a year ago that Chico Fraley was sprawled unconscious on a 
rain-slick street in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
The car in which he was riding skidded and was struck from behind by another 
vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I was ejected from the back of the hatchback," said Fraley, Washington's 
junior inside linebacker from Bishop Amat High. "I don't remember anything. 
Only what people tell me." 
</P>
<P>
The other occupants in the car, cornerback Dana Hall, the driver, and former 
teammate Ivory Randle, were shaken up but uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first one who got to him," Hall said. "He wasn't breathing at the 
time." 
</P>
<P>
Facial scars are the only physical evidence of Fraley's accident. He said that 
he plans to have cosmetic surgery sometime next year when the scars are 
completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very fortunate," Fraley said. 
</P>
<P>
He has had his share of misfortune. 
</P>
<P>
Midway through the 1989 season he suffered broken ribs in a game against 
California and didn't play again until the Dec. 30 Freedom Bowl game against 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Then, eight days later, he was thrown out of a car onto a wet street. 
</P>
<P>
A quiet sort with an easy smile, Fraley doesn't project the menacing mannerisms 
of an inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
For one thing, he is undersized for the position. His weight varies from 208 to 
220 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
As a baby, his parents named him Chico, Spanish for "small." 
</P>
<P>
However, the small Fraley has been a big-play performer for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley is the second-leading tackler on the team and was named second-team 
All-Pacific 10. He had a team-high eight tackles in a 31-0 rout of USC and and 
had 12 against Arizona in a 54-10 victory that clinched the Pac-10 championship 
and the Rose Bowl berth. 
</P>
<P>
By beating the Trojans in the third game of the season, the Huskies emerged as 
the dominant team in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
Reflecting on that game, Fraley said: "The night before the game Coach (Don) 
James said that we were a good team, but that it didn't really matter what we 
had done the last two weeks (beating San Jose State and Purdue). 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'A lot of people don't think you're good enough to beat USC, but it 
takes great challenges to create a good team and this is a great challenge.' 
</P>
<P>
"We came out with the mind set that we could win." 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies scored 340 points in eight conference games, a league record, 
compared to 95 for the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, in their first six conference games, they outscored opponents, 72-7, 
in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
It was a simple formula: The defense would stifle the opposition and the 
offense would score quickly. 
</P>
<P>
Then they were upset by UCLA, 25-22, failing to score in the first quarter for 
the first time in the season. 
</P>
<P>
"UCLA had an excellent game plan," Fraley said. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't scared of any mystique we might have. They came up with the big 
plays and we didn't. We lost some one-on-one battles we should have won and 
that was the difference." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the Huskies, 9-2 overall, are in the Rose Bowl and are 
substantially favored to beat Iowa, the Big Ten representative. 
</P>
<P>
"We practiced down here last year for the Freedom Bowl game (Washington won, 
34-7)," Fraley said, "but it wasn't the same. There is so much more feeling to 
it now." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he can do a little boasting if he meets two of his former high school 
teammates, Stephon Pace and Mazio Royster, who play for USC. 
</P>
<P>
"Now I have the bragging rights," Fraley said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley was also a high school teammate of Eric Bieniemy, Colorado's 
accomplished running back, who was third in the Heisman Trophy balloting. 
</P>
<P>
"Eric and I did the things that high school buddies do together," said Fraley, 
who took a recruiting trip to Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked the trip, but I felt more comfortable at Washington. Jim Heacock (a 
former Husky assistant coach) talked and acted the same way with me while I was 
being recruited. He was up straight with me." 
</P>
<P>
Fraley said that his father, Charles, who is now an X-ray technician in San 
Diego, visited him when he first enrolled at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"He walked around the campus and said, 'I can see why you chose the school.' " 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies have one of the most intimidating defenses in the country. They 
lead the nation in rushing defense and turnover margin. 
</P>
<P>
"We like to disguise our defenses," Fraley said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a guessing game and we've been good at it so far." 
</P>
<P>
The Rose Bowl game will not only be a homecoming for Fraley, but 11 other 
Southern California area players who are on the first two offensive and 
defensive units. There are 26 Southern Californians on the Washington travel 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
Fraley says that Iowa will be a formidable opponent despite the fact that 
Washington has been made a heavy favorite over the Hawkeyes. 
</P>
<P>
"Iowa has an excellent team and has a big back in Nick Bell, who runs well," he 
said. "Their offensive line is big and strong and they have a smart quarterback 
in Matt Rodgers. He audibles a lot, has an accurate arm and is not afraid to 
run." 
</P>
<P>
As for himself, Fraley is just thankful to be alive after his accident last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the Seattle Times, he said: "It opens you up a 
little bit, telling yourself you've got to live every day, day to day, because 
you could die at any minute. I'm still the same person, but it does open your 
eyes."

Stop us if you have heard this before: 
</P>
<P>
Brigham Young's football team, with an impressive record and high national 
ranking, covers enough land throwing the ball to make even the best real estate 
agents green with envy. The end of the season arrives, and the Cougars make 
their bowl reservations. 
</P>
<P>
Surprise, it's the Holiday Bowl, home of the Western Athletic Conference 
champion. The game approaches. The Cougars prepare for traditional a big-time 
opponent, such as Ohio State or Michigan or Penn State. But many football fans 
across the nation yawn. Wake us up when BYU plays a real team, they say. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, BYU players bristle. They talk about getting respect. And the bowl 
arrives . . . 
</P>
<P>
Welcome to Holiday Bowl week, 1990. BYU will play Texas A&amp;M (8-3-1) 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
It will be BYU's ninth appearance in the 14-year history of the Holiday Bowl. 
It has come to be expected, like finding your newspaper in the driveway each 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
The Cougars are 10-2, including a 28-21 victory over No. 1 Miami in Provo Sept. 
8. BYU eventually crept as high as fourth in the national rankings and, as 
recently as 3 1/2 weeks ago, had a chance at the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
Then the Cougars went to Hawaii Dec. 1. Quarterback Ty Detmer received word 
that afternoon that he had won the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
And BYU received a good, old-fashioned whipping that night, 59-28, as four 
passes by Detmer were intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
The chorus of naysayers started immediately. BYU, a national championship team? 
Ha! 
</P>
<P>
So BYU, rated 13th, arrives a little red in the face. The Cougars will line up 
against unranked Texas A&amp;M and, like most of their bowl games in the past, 
this one will be about respect. 
</P>
<P>
Fullback Matt Bellini said, "We're out to prove to people we're a top-10 team. 
We get wound up to play big opponents, because we don't get respect because of 
the conference we play in. 
</P>
<P>
"And, we throw the football. We're not three-yards-and-a-cloud of dust." 
</P>
<P>
BYU is ranked second nationally in pass efficiency with a rating of 155.5, 
total offense of 565.8 yards a game and scoring of 42.5 points a game. Detmer 
is second in pass efficiency with a rating of 155.9 and total offense with 
418.5 yards a game. Receiver Andy Boyce finished fourth in catches per game 
with 6.58 and in reception yardage with 1,241. 
</P>
<P>
The most familiar names are Detmer, who has passed for 5,188 yards this season, 
and Chris Smith, BYU's All-American tight end. But don't forget about Boyce, a 
senior wide receiver, who caught 79 passes and averaged 15.7 yards per catch 
and a team-high 103.4 yards per game. 
</P>
<P>
"Andy Boyce has had an outstanding year," BYU Coach LaVell Edwards said. "Ty 
and Chris Smith have gotten the attention, but Andy Boyce has been a big plus 
for us." 
</P>
<P>
There is something else you should know about this team. Edwards likes more 
than the offense. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we've developed defensively, and the way we've developed as a team, 
period," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"When we started last spring, we were a long way away from being a 
championship-caliber football team. But we stayed healthy. And the defense 
really played well until that last game against Hawaii." 
</P>
<P>
BYU is toughest against the run, having limited opponents to an average of 
116.3 yards a game. The Cougars' best defenders are senior end Rich Kaufusi, 
senior linebacker Alema Fitisemanu and senior back Brian Mitchell. All were 
first-team all-WAC picks. 
</P>
<P>
But if you ask Edwards what impressed him most this year, he won't talk of 
Miami, or of the Washington State game the next week, when the Cougars turned a 
29-7 halftime deficit into a 50-36 victory. He won't tell you about his 13th 
WAC championship in 19 years of coaching, or about Detmer's Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
His favorite thing about 1990? 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of kids we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had fewer problems among this team than any I've had in some time. They 
all seem to like each other. Nobody has been jealous of Ty. There have been no 
personality conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
The biggest disappointment was the loss in Hawaii. The Cougars were 10-1 at the 
time, having lost only Sept. 29 at Oregon, 32-16, on a day when five of 
Detmer's passes were intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
But that was nothing compared to Hawaii, which Edwards said ranked with BYU's 
38-37 loss to Indiana in the 1979 Holiday Bowl as the most disappointing in his 
career. Maybe it wouldn't have been quite so bad had the same thing not 
happened a year earlier, when BYU also was beaten in Hawaii, 56-14. 
</P>
<P>
"Having had that happen to us the year before . . . I just couldn't believe 
it," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
"We had good practices, good intensity. I don't know whether the Heisman 
(earlier in the day) had anything to do with it. You can start figuring out all 
kinds of reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Said Bellini: "It took me a long time to get over it. I still don't know what 
happened. They did the same thing the year before. I don't know if we don't 
match up with them or what." 
</P>
<P>
So the Cougars come to San Diego in search of respect. It was that way when 
they won their only national championship in 1984, clinched by a 24-17 Holiday 
Bowl victory over Michigan, and it remains that way this week. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that has something to do with it," Bellini said. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember (1988), we lost three of our last four and came into the Freedom 
Bowl and beat a good Colorado team (20-17). It's a similar-type situation now. 
</P>
<P>
"Although we have a better team now, I think pride is still involved. Whether 
we're ranked sixth or 12th, we've got to try to win. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure there are people out there saying they don't think we're a good team. 
I'm looking forward to showing them we can play." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Holiday Bowl Notes 
</P>
<P>
Kickoff is scheduled for 4:30 p.m. Saturday . . . BYU is 4-4 in Holiday Bowls. 
Texas A&amp;M is making its first appearance. . . . Brigham Young fullback Matt 
Bellini is a tentative starter. Bellini suffered torn ligaments in his right 
ankle at Utah Nov. 17. He missed the next week's Utah State game and played 
sparingly against Hawaii. Although he is a fullback, he is used mainly as a 
receiver -- his 204 receptions rank ninth on the NCAA career list and second on 
the WAC career list.

<P>
Matt LaBounty's story is an old one. Maybe it's corny and, in these 
recruiting-mad days, unlikely. But it's all his. 
</P>
<P>
The University of Oregon coaching staff found him by accident. Studying the 
films of a prized recruit, they kept noticing this skinny guy from the other 
team making all the big plays. 
</P>
<P>
Soon enough, they forgot about the first player and began to focus on LaBounty, 
then a 6-foot-4, 210-pound offensive lineman for San Marin High in Novato. 
</P>
<P>
LaBounty was all over the field, knocking people down, getting up and doing it 
again on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
Well, the coaches said, if we could get a little meat on those bones and drill 
him with some solid technique, we might be able to make something out of him. 
</P>
<P>
They plotted further: We'll have to get him off the offensive line, maybe to 
defensive end. 
</P>
<P>
The best part? No one else showed much interest. He was theirs for the taking. 
</P>
<P>
He was an all-league offensive lineman his senior season at San Marin, but only 
Washington State and Oregon State showed even lukewarm interest before Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon Coach Rich Brooks, having seen him only only on film, decided to take a 
closer look and arranged for LaBounty to visit Eugene. One look around the 
campus, and LaBounty, still surprised anyone was interested, was sold. 
</P>
<P>
LaBounty became Oregon's career sack leader in 1990. He also has been named 
second-team All-Pacific 10 Conference. 
</P>
<P>
A junior, he has managed to gain a few pounds along the way, beefing up to 251. 
Oregon coaches no longer refer to LaBounty as their "scrawny" defensive end. 
Now, he's "undersized." 
</P>
<P>
Brooks will also call him surprising, along with aggressive, durable and tough. 
</P>
<P>
LaBounty has started 23 consecutive games at defensive end. He will be trying 
to improve his school-record 20 1/2 career sacks in start No. 24 when Oregon 
plays Colorado State Dec. 29 in the Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
He has done this despite being outweighed by at least 40 pounds -- often it's 
50 or 60 -- in every game. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't really say he's ever been dominated, even when he was a redshirt 
freshman," Brooks said before a recent practice at UC Irvine. "He still runs 
around like he weighs 210. Even though he's bigger now, he hasn't lost any 
speed." 
</P>
<P>
Without great girth, LaBounty gets by on technique. Often, he is tougher on 
himself than opposing quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
"It just kills him when he doesn't do something right," Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Some ends overpower offensive linemen on their way to a sack or a tackle. 
LaBounty simply is not strong enough, or big enough. 
</P>
<P>
So he studies films all hours of the night, stays as low as possible and runs 
around opposing linemen instead of trying to go through them. 
</P>
<P>
"Basically, I got here by luck," LaBounty said. "I don't know how to explain 
it." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, but now that he has arrived, there is no holding him back. 
</P>
<P>
In last season's Independence Bowl, LaBounty chased Tulsa quarterback T.J. 
Rubley from sideline to sideline, forcing an incomplete pass. Oregon, playing 
its first bowl game since 1963, won, 27-24. LaBounty finished his sophomore 
season with 6 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
LaBounty's 10 sacks this season are two short of the school record of 12 set by 
Mike Walter in 1982. The Ducks have set a school team mark with 39. 
</P>
<P>
None was bigger than LaBounty's sack of UCLA quarterback Tommy Maddox late in 
the Nov. 3 game at Autzen Stadium in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
Oregon had stopped UCLA's rushing game, eventually limiting the Bruins to 71 
yards. But Maddox passed for 332 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Late in the game, he was moving UCLA toward another score when LaBounty slipped 
past center Aron Gideon and dropped Maddox. It gave LaBounty the school career 
record and helped preserve a 28-24 victory. 
</P>
<P>
And to think his only goal has been to start for three seasons at Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm just so thankful to be playing," he said. "Everybody in college knows 
somebody they played with who would have given their right arm to play college 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't ask for more, except maybe to play in the Rose Bowl. And I still 
have a chance to do that next year." 
</P>
<P>
LaBounty still remembers his high school days, when he tried all summer to add 
bulk. 
</P>
<P>
He once weighed 220 going into the season, but the extra pounds melted away 
during two-a-day workouts and he dropped to 207. 
</P>
<P>
"It was all just fat," he said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
There was something more beneath the fat, even if LaBounty couldn't recognize 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"When I watch my high school films," he said, "I don't know what they saw." 
</P>
<P>
Most likely, it was simply potential.

Carson High quarterback John Walsh and Poly running back Jonathan Campbell were 
selected City players of the year in the 4-A and 3-A Divisions, respectively, 
to highlight the 54th annual All-City football teams selected by Los Angeles 
area sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Walsh, who led the Colts to the 4-A Division title with a 12-1 record, set 
state single-season records with 4,206 passing yards and 48 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He completed 229 of 388 passes and threw for more than 300 yards in eight 
games. 
</P>
<P>
Carson had the most players on the 4-A Division team with nine, followed by 
Dorsey and Banning with four apiece. Tailback/quarterback Lamont Warren of 
Dorsey, last season's player of the year, heads a list of five returning 
All-City selections in the 4-A Division. He is joined by defensive back Derrick 
Stewart of Granada Hills, running back Ontiwaun Carter of Kennedy and defensive 
linemen Marcus Long and Bob Tuitau of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, who led the Parrots' to the 3-A Division title with an 11-3 record, 
gained a school-record 2,091 yards, an average of 149.4 a game, with 31 
touchdowns. In Poly's last five games of the season, Campbell rushed for 865 
yards in 139 carries and scored eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He rushed for 200 yards and scored two touchdowns in the Parrots' 28-8 victory 
over Lincoln in the 3-A Division title game. 
</P>
<P>
Poly, which had never won a City football title before, had two other players, 
offensive lineman Edward Moraino and defensive back Raul Torres, on the 3-A 
Division team.

THEIR HOBBY IS ON THE ROCKS;

SERIOUS CLIMBERS THREATENED BY THOSE WHO WOULD SPOIL THE BEST SITES

JOSHUA TREE 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a bright, crisp December morning, Hidden Valley Campground in Joshua Tree 
National Monument is filled with cars from faraway places, including Tennessee, 
Alaska and the Yukon. Their owners have all come to climb rocks. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the Mecca," says Nancy Henderson, the campground host, "the best 
(place) in the world for winter rock climbing." 
</P>
<P>
When other popular sites succumb to snow and ice, hundreds of climbers from 
around the world descend upon Joshua Tree like ants on a picnic, testing 
themselves on the solid quartz-monzonite monoliths rising from the high-desert 
floor. They concentrate at Hidden Valley because the campsites are laid out 
among the rocks and they can climb right out of their camps -- or somebody 
else's camp. And there's the rub. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, they didn't always ask permission of the occupants, and over the 
years they established about 3,500 climbing routes in the monument's 
half-million acres by drilling in permanent security bolts, with hangers and 
slings. They trampled out miles of meandering trails getting to those rocks. 
They defiled Indian pictographs and petroglyphs. They played their radios too 
loud, partied too late and stayed too long, leaving their trash behind when 
they finally did depart. 
</P>
<P>
Those were the old rock climbers -- "a dirt-bag image," concedes Randy Vogel, a 
Santa Ana lawyer who heads the Access Fund, an offshoot of the American Alpine 
Club that is working, Vogel says, "to change that image." 
</P>
<P>
If they can't change it, the climbers fear, they may lose their privilege to 
climb at Joshua Tree and elsewhere. They have already been barred from the 
Superstition Wilderness Area in Arizona, and the National Park Service is 
working up new management plans for Joshua Tree and the similar City of Rocks 
site in Idaho that could alter how all national parks are used. 
</P>
<P>
The new generation of climbers doesn't seem to be a problem. On this day, there 
is a couple on almost every rock around Hidden Valley, but the only sounds are 
murmurs of climbing talk and the loud hush of the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Trails are marked with neat, unobtrusive signs to consolidate foot traffic. 
There are new plastic outhouses. The bolts on established routes are virtually 
invisible and will become more so following planned "bolt camouflaging" parties 
when climbers will paint unsold bolts and hangers at local climbing equipment 
stores to match the terrain. 
</P>
<P>
Other routes at the Schwarzenegger Wall, near historic Indian artwork, have 
been "chopped" or eliminated by removing the bolts and patching over the holes. 
</P>
<P>
All of that has been done at the $10,000 expense of the climbers, who also plan 
to build another campground, seeing as how they have all but pushed the 
non-climbing tourists out of Hidden Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"You'd think we were strip-mining from the way some people talk," Vogel says. 
"If we were Winnebago people, they'd bend over backward to build facilities for 
us." 
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, the Access Fund and its related activist group, Friends of 
Joshua Tree, staged a cleanup day. The 259 climbers who turned in trash bags at 
the end of the day got tickets for a free meal from their favorite hangout, 
Edchada's Mexican restaurant in nearby Yucca Valley. 
</P>
<P>
"They had a vegetarian special," Henderson says. "Most climbers are 
vegetarians." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson, petite and fit, is a dedicated climber herself, as is Todd Swain, a 
tall park ranger. They believe that persons in authority who relate to climbers 
can be an effective liaison with the National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
Before he arrived, Swain says, "There were a couple of rangers that really 
hated climbers." 
</P>
<P>
Henderson says: "The last (campground) hosts were an older couple that didn't 
relate well to the climbers. The story was that the climbers would get on their 
Winnebago and rock it back and forth while the people were inside." 
</P>
<P>
Are climbers taking over the park? 
</P>
<P>
If they are, the park could do worse. Sure, they're protecting their interest, 
but the place has never been cleaner. After five hours, a visitor has seen only 
one piece of litter and no bottles or cans. 
</P>
<P>
"Climbers are not the irresponsible sort of vagabonds that they used to be 10 
or 15 years ago, doing drugs and stuff like that," Henderson says. "These 
people go to bed early, watch what they eat. They are athletes in training. 
They have a singleness of purpose." 
</P>
<P>
This year, the park will have more than a million visitors for the first time. 
Vogel estimates that 50% to 60% will have been climbers, qualifying that group 
as the major user of the park. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Anderson, who recently retired after 14 years as the park's 
superintendent, says the figure is "probably 15% -- not more than 20%. The 
other people just aren't as conspicuous." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson saw the sport change and grow dramatically during his 14 years, when 
he tried to balance climbing with other uses of the park, such as bird 
watching, photography or plain, benign nature loving. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the era when a lot of high-risk sports have taken off -- hang gliding, 
sky-diving, bungee cords off bridges," Anderson says. 
</P>
<P>
The climbers became known as "rock bums." Some still are. 
</P>
<P>
"The climbing group is like any other," Anderson says. "About 90% of 'em are 
real well behaved, and the other 10% are high-profile." 
</P>
<P>
But Anderson was a friend of the climbers. "I climbed most of the stuff in 
Yosemite years ago, so I have a feeling for the climbers," he says. 
</P>
<P>
He laid down only a few special rules for climbers: no power drills for placing 
bolts, no brightly colored bolts or slings and no climbing from occupied 
campsites without permission. 
</P>
<P>
The climbers decided they could live with all of that. In fact, many welcomed 
the rules. 
</P>
<P>
Cyndie Bransford, who teaches school in Yucca Valley, says: "Climbers are more 
protective of the environment. We spend more time here. We don't want to see it 
a mess." 
</P>
<P>
Bolting -- the placing of permanent bolts to clip one's rope harness onto in 
case of a fall -- is a rising controversy among climbers themselves, especially 
since the popularity of sport climbing has risen. 
</P>
<P>
Don't ever call a rock climber a sport climber. 
</P>
<P>
Swain says: "Sport climbing is the step between the artificial walls and what 
used to be rock climbing, where there's the element of doubt as to where the 
route goes and where you can get protection in, as opposed to these 
sport-climbing things where the bolts are all basically a body length apart so 
there's no way you're going to get hurt. You don't have to figure anything out 
because the bolts are already there."

Rock climbers do use bolts when they feel they must, but they also place 
expandable mechanical devices called "friends" in cracks and remove them after 
the climb. They cling to an ethic of meeting nature closer to its own terms, 
rather than merely ascending a wall, as Royal Robbins writes, already 
"festooned with bolts." 
</P>
<P>
Bransford says: "This is a more traditional (climbing) area than a lot of other 
places in the country." 
</P>
<P>
Swain, who is known around Joshua Tree as "the climbing ranger," says there are 
climbers who "even though they can put in natural gear that doesn't deface the 
rock at all, they're putting bolts in just for convenience. They take the 
easiest way out, and that's what climbing is coming to. People's ethics are 
slipping." 
</P>
<P>
Bransford didn't climb until she moved to Joshua Tree four years ago. Now she 
climbs 150 days a year, all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm afraid of heights," she says. "I cried the whole first year." 
</P>
<P>
Dave Mayville, a guide, is coaching Monie Lindsay, a banker from Chicago, up 
the route called, "Fun Stuff." Her knuckles are bleeding and she is at maximum 
exertion, but she seems to be enjoying herself. 
</P>
<P>
"Climbing used to be an adventure," Mayville says. "Now it's a sport. 
Sport-climbing has its place. Josh is just not the place." 
</P>
<P>
Anderson doesn't know who will replace him. The climbers hope it will be 
someone attuned to their interests. Anderson says a superintendent would have 
the authority to close the park to climbing, if he cared to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, if he had the guts. Politically, I don't think he could. The climbing 
community has been recognized since the inception of the National Park Service. 
It's an appropriate use of the resource."

ECONOMIC REFORMS HELP LATIN AMERICA EASE ITS DEBT CRISIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Latin America may, at last, be showing the first signs of emerging from its 
debt crisis, which poured red ink onto U.S. banks in the late 1980s and created 
a crisis of confidence in Latin economies. 
</P>
<P>
After a 17-month hiatus, Brazil -- Latin America's largest debtor nation -- 
announced earlier this month that it would resume interest payments on the $60 
billion it owes private banks early next year. Meanwhile, the World Bank said 
in a new report that the debt crisis facing developing countries is "somewhat 
less severe." 
</P>
<P>
Banking officials and other experts say they are heartened by economic changes 
that have enabled countries such as Venezuela, Mexico and Uruguay to 
successfully reschedule some of their huge debt this year and get on sounder 
financial footing. That, in turn, offers a bit of brightness for American banks 
in an increasingly gloomy business environment. 
</P>
<P>
However, analysts caution that Latin America's progress could be jeopardized by 
a U.S. recession as well as sharply higher oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
"The big story is that these economies are opening up," said Kenneth Hoffman, a 
vice president who heads the international finance department at the New York 
brokerage Shearson Lehman Hutton. "Everybody is hoping that this constant round 
of reschedulings is finally over." 
</P>
<P>
In one significant vote of confidence, Moody's Investors Service Inc. earlier 
this month gave Mexico's foreign currency debt its highest rating for a Latin 
American country. Although Moody's Ba-2 rating for Mexico's $95 billion of 
foreign currency debt is below investment grade, the ratings agency said the 
relatively positive appraisal reflects Mexico's success at economic reform. 
</P>
<P>
The same day, Peru and the International Monetary Fund agreed on broad 
guidelines for economic reforms, clearing the way for new loans. 
</P>
<P>
Peruvian officials now hope that the United States, Japan and some European and 
Latin American countries will provide low-interest loans and grants totaling 
$2.5 billion during the next year to cover a balance-of-payments gap and to 
clear back-due interest that piled up during former President Alan Garcia's 
administration. 
</P>
<P>
Through the past decade, Western bankers and Latin American finance ministers 
have debated how to retire the region's estimated $428-billion foreign debt, 
built up during a long orgy of lending and spending, and exacerbated by waste 
and corruption. 
</P>
<P>
The principal weapon employed to attack the debt problem recently has been the 
so-called Brady initiative, named for U.S. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady 
and launched in March, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Under the Brady plan, commercial banks agree to forgive part of the money they 
are owed by a foreign borrower or to reduce the interest rates charged. In 
exchange, the remainder of the loans to the developing nation are effectively 
guaranteed by the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the 
industrialized nations that support those organizations. 
</P>
<P>
Brady-style loan rescheduling pacts, initially pooh-poohed by many analysts, 
have been arranged with increasing frequency in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Venezuela rescheduled some of its $34.4 billion in foreign 
debt. Earlier this month, commercial lenders agreed to reschedule about $1.69 
billion in loans to Uruguay. Chile and Costa Rica have also signed debt 
agreements, and Ecuador and Argentina are holding discussions with their banks. 
</P>
<P>
Although some experts say the approach gives indebted nations much needed 
breathing room, there continues to be widespread frustration with the tactic 
among Latin Americans. Residents complain that Brady agreements force their 
governments to extend painful austerity measures under which they have been 
suffering for years, without helping rebuild Latin economies. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, for U.S. bankers, rearranging payment schedules neither erases debt 
nor makes up for losses. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact is that the majority of the countries are not servicing their debt. 
They are still in arrears," said Robert Devlin, a senior economist in the 
Santiago office of the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America. 
"Those arrears are reflective of the deficiencies in the debt strategy." 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the same World Bank report that saw glimmers of hope in the developing 
nations' debt picture noted that those countries' collective debt continued to 
grow in 1990, climbing 6% to $1.34 trillion. 
</P>
<P>
But skepticism in some parts of the U.S. financial community is apparently 
beginning to subside as economic reforms take hold in portions of Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
Although experts point out that each country's financial plight is unique, 
overall America has become "cautiously optimistic" about many of its southern 
neighbors, said Mark Constantine, an aide to the House Banking Committee's 
international development, finance, trade and monetary policy subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
Why? In recent years, a number of Latin American nations have dropped trade 
barriers, instituted economic reforms and adopted more realistic foreign 
currency exchange rates to improve their economies, Constantine explained. 
</P>
<P>
Four countries -- Bolivia, Colombia, Peru and Venezuela -- agreed in November 
to eliminate tariffs and open a free-trade zone to foreign capital by the end 
of 1991. Meanwhile, Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay plan to establish a 
common market by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
That sort of economic liberalization may do more to help Latin America recover 
from a decade of troubles than any debt relief plan, World Bank officials say. 
</P>
<P>
Officials are particularly hopeful for major oil exporting countries such as 
Venezuela and Mexico. John Reed, chairman of New York's Citicorp -- the biggest 
U.S. bank and the one with the most loans to Latin America -- recently told an 
audience in Mexico City: "Debt is not an issue in Mexico" any longer for 
international banks. 
</P>
<P>
That upbeat assessment, however, is tempered by tough times in many nations in 
the region -- especially Brazil, Peru and Argentina, where hyper-inflation 
remains a persistent worry. What's more, a United Nations study reported last 
week that just three of 24 Latin American nations studied -- Costa Rica, 
Venezuela and Colombia -- had positive economic growth rates this year. 
</P>
<P>
Although Brazil's announcement that it will resume interest payments to private 
banks may be seen as good news by some, virtually all analysts said the 
economic plight of Latin America's largest nation remains dire. Few believe 
that Brazil can keep up interest payments without significant infusions of 
foreign capital. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the lack of growth, lenders and investors are hanging tough. 
</P>
<P>
"Many countries in the region are taking positive steps to privatize (their 
industries) and . . . integrate their economies," said William Orme, editor of 
Latin Finance, a Miami-based publication that covers the field. "There's more 
optimism now."

TAX HIKE HAS BEER AND SPIRITS SELLERS PORING OVER BOTTLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
'Tis the season to be counting bottles -- at least for the owners and operators 
of stores that sell alcoholic beverages. 
</P>
<P>
Starting today), retailers will add up every bottle of bourbon, brandy, beer 
and burgundy on shelves and in storage to determine the additional tax burden 
generated by a Jan. 1 federal excise tax increase. Distributors of alcoholic 
beverages must also conduct inventories to determine their additional tax 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time "floor tax" will generate an estimated $300 million in additional 
tax revenue for Uncle Sam. Alcoholic beverage manufacturers will incorporate 
the tax increase into the price of beverages shipped to retailers and 
distributors after Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
Although retailers will pay the added tax, most plan to pass it through to 
consumers. Some stores are urging consumers to purchase their spirits before 
year-end to avoid the tax hike. 
</P>
<P>
The federal excise tax increase will be marked. 
</P>
<P>
The tax on a 750-millimeter bottle of red table wine will jump to 21 cents from 
3 cents. The tax on a six-pack of beer will increase to 33 cents from 16 cents. 
And the tax on an 80-proof, 750-millimeter bottle of gin will rise to $2.14 
from $1.98. 
</P>
<P>
Only the 67-cent tax on champagnes and sparkling wines will not jump. 
</P>
<P>
Although federal regulators have exempted many small shops from the inventory, 
the bottle count will be a time-consuming and costly affair for larger stores 
and chains such as San Diego-based Liquor Barn, with 63 stores in California. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to guess that we've probably got 50,000 bottles at each store . . . 
so we've got an estimated 3 million bottles to count," said Liquor Barn 
Executive Vice President Lew Silverberg. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Barn hopes to use results from the federally mandated count for another 
tax-related inventory scheduled to be completed Jan. 31. But the excise tax 
inventory is decidedly more complicated than a traditional year-end count, 
Silverberg said, because retailers who are passing the tax increase along to 
consumers must retag merchandise with the new, higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
That takes time, because -- unlike an inventory -- "we have to physically touch 
each bottle," Silverberg said. "The customer wants to know when he looks at the 
shelf what the price is, so every item has to be repriced." 
</P>
<P>
Also, the bottle count is complicated because federal Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms tax schedules vary by beverage type, alcoholic content and 
bottle size. Consequently, beer, wine and spirits are each taxed on a different 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Another complication: Store owners must use conversion tables to determine 
their tax burden because wine and distilled spirits are packaged in 
metric-sized bottles, and the federal government still computes taxes by the 
gallon. 
</P>
<P>
The count "is a lot of work," Silverberg said. "There's no way to minimize it, 
even with all of the modern electronic equipment . . . because that's not going 
to (generate) sufficient data for this kind of (tax) return." 
</P>
<P>
Liquor Barn will spend an estimated eight to 10 hours on the tax inventory at 
each store. The chain's employees, as well as inventory firms, will complete 
the counts after stores close for the day. 
</P>
<P>
The year-end timing of the bottle count could cause problems for retailers. The 
holiday season is the "time when retailers either make or break it," said John 
Burcham, executive director of the Bethesda, Md.-based National Liquor Stores 
Assn. A count that begins the day after Christmas "doesn't give retailers time 
to collect their wits (and) study the instructions," Burcham said. 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, Southern California grocers with extensive alcoholic beverage stocks 
must find time during their busiest season to count bottles and compute the 
additional tax bite. 
</P>
<P>
The excise tax inventory is "one of a number of things going on in the retail 
food industry that have to be completed," said Steve Koff, president of the 
Southern California Grocers Assn. Grocers will also program cash registers for 
a state sales-tax increase as well as changes in various county sales taxes. 
</P>
<P>
Burcham said retailers who wait until the last minute to review the complicated 
inventory regulations will be "horrified." 
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms is allowing retailers to count 
their inventory and figure the additional tax during a "window" that begins 
today and ends Jan. 10. However, retailers must "justify" that total by 
incorporating deliveries from distributors and over-the-counter sales that 
occur before Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
That scheme was designed to discourage retailers from attempting to beat the 
tax by ordering massive deliveries from retailers just hours before year-end, 
Silverberg said. 
</P>
<P>
And, the bureau won't simply take a retailer's word that a count is accurate. 
</P>
<P>
"We will have inspectors checking to make sure that people have paid the tax," 
said spokeswoman Kris Meldrum.

PAN AM TRYING TO UNDERMINE DEAL, TWA SAYS; 
</P>
<P>
AIRLINES: TWA CHAIRMAN CARL C. ICAHN SAYS PAN AM'S RECENT EFFORTS TO SELL OFF 
CHUNKS OF ITS OPERATION SHOW LACK OF GOOD FAITH IN THE MERGER TALKS BETWEEN THE 
CARRIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Hopes dimmed Tuesday for a merger of Trans World Airlines and Pan American 
World Airways, as TWA Chairman Carl C. Icahn bitterly denounced his counterpart 
at Pan Am for repeatedly undermining Icahn's quest to combine the nation's 
premier transatlantic carriers. 
</P>
<P>
Revealing that the airlines have held on-again, off-again merger talks since 
mid-October, Icahn said in a letter to Pan Am Chairman Thomas G. Plaskett that 
Pan Am's efforts to sell pieces of its operations to other carriers 
demonstrated "lack of a good faith interest in negotiating the merger of our 
airlines." 
</P>
<P>
The letter, released Tuesday by TWA, was prompted by a published report Monday 
indicating that Northwest Airlines had arranged financing for a $150-million 
purchase of Pan Am's Boston-New York-Washington shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
Neither airline has confirmed the existence of such a deal, in which the 
financing arm of an Oregon utility would acquire the shuttle and Northwest 
would run it, with an option to buy the lucrative operation. 
</P>
<P>
Plaskett had told Icahn in a letter Friday that a merger of Pan Am and TWA 
might prove "advantageous," if TWA would pony up the cash to tide struggling 
Pan Am through the slow winter months. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Plaskett, according to Icahn's latest missive, canceled a meeting Monday at 
which the two men were to have discussed the financing of a TWA-Pan Am merger. 
</P>
<P>
Likening the purported shuttle deal to Pan Am's sale of its London routes to 
United Airlines in October for $400 million, Icahn accused Plaskett of dumping 
valuable Pan Am assets for "less than market value." 
</P>
<P>
Wrote Icahn: "It appears that you will go to any extremes to avoid the merger 
with us that you say in your letter would be advantageous." 
</P>
<P>
He warned too that a sale of the shuttle could create legal entanglements if 
Pan Am subsequently falls into bankruptcy, as some analysts expect. 
</P>
<P>
"I assume that, once again, entrenchment of existing management will be the 
principal purpose of the transaction," Icahn fumed, "rather than something that 
might ultimately benefit your shareholders, employees and creditors, as well as 
the traveling public." 
</P>
<P>
Spokesman Jeffrey Kriendler said Tuesday that Pan Am was still waiting to make 
"a credible proposal" for buying the airline 
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts have questioned whether Icahn has been serious about 
acquiring Pan Am. Even if he is, there are doubts that TWA has the wherewithal 
to accomplish a merger. Together, the airlines carry $3.6 billion in debt, and 
neither has a strong domestic operation to feed its overseas routes. 
</P>
<P>
Yet because many of Pan Am's and TWA's transatlantic routes overlap, a merged 
airline could raise a tidy sum by selling off the duplicates. Some analysts 
speculate that Icahn -- considered more a deal maker than a manager -- might 
then sell the slimmed-down combination, perhaps in some measure to a foreign 
carrier, if overseas airlines are granted more freedom to buy American 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
In his letter, Icahn told Plaskett that a merger "might well be your airline's 
only hope of survival." But some analysts say Pan Am could hang on as a much 
smaller independent force if it continues its asset-selling spree.

EUROPEANS WANT JAPAN TO CUT ITS TRADE SURPLUS; 
</P>
<P>
COMMERCE: MOST HAVE A FAVORABLE VIEW OF THE PACIFIC POWER, A SURVEY SHOWS. BUT 
THEY DON'T THINK IT IS FULFILLING ITS GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITIES.

A majority of people surveyed in major European countries have a favorable view 
of Japan but believe that it is not fulfilling its international 
responsibilities, the Foreign Ministry reported Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Among the chief criticisms was that Japan needs to correct its trade imbalance. 
However, many respondents said creation of the single European market planned 
for 1992 will improve relations between Japan and the European Community, the 
ministry said in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
The sixth such poll since 1977, it was carried out from September through 
October by private research organizations in Britain, France, Germany, Belgium, 
Italy, the Netherlands and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
In all seven countries, "the degree of trust in Japan is rather high," ranging 
from 71% to 91%, the ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
In every country except Italy, however, a majority of respondents thought Japan 
was not fulfilling its international role. 
</P>
<P>
Japan, the world's No. 2 economic power, has come under criticism for not doing 
more to assist U.S.-led forces in the Persian Gulf and to ease its chronic 
trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
Many respondents called for a prompt correction of Japan's surplus with the EC, 
which totaled $1.49 billion in November. The most commonly cited recommendation 
was for Japan to open its markets more and expand domestic demand. 
</P>
<P>
Among other findings of the survey: 
</P>
<P>
* Expectations of direct investment from Japan were high in every country. 
</P>
<P>
* Business development by Japanese companies in Eastern Europe was "generally 
desired." Most respondents said Japanese companies should invest only in 
cooperation with Western European countries. In Germany, however, 71% said the 
Japanese should get involved on their own. 
</P>
<P>
The survey, sponsored by the Foreign Ministry, was conducted by mail in 
Britain, western Germany and Belgium. Responses came from 1,543 of 6,550 people 
to whom questionnaires were mailed. 
</P>
<P>
In the other countries, interviews were conducted. A total of 1,936 people 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
The poll did not give a margin of error. Japanese pollsters do not calculate 
such margins, contending that they might mislead readers into thinking a poll 
is more accurate than it really is.

Phone Call Foul-Up: About 25,000 families and friends of people serving in the 
Persian Gulf were mistakenly billed for calls that were supposed to be free, 
and the charges will be canceled, AT&amp;T officials said. 
</P>
<P>
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. had offered to let servicemen and women 
in the gulf make the free calls during Thanksgiving week, and 140,000 calls 
were made. But some local phone companies did not follow through on 
instructions not to bill the troops' families for these calls, AT&amp;T said. 
No one will have to pay for the bills, no matter how high they were, AT&amp;T 
added.

Dollar Climbs in Tokyo: The dollar rose against the yen as stock prices fell in 
sluggish trading in Tokyo amid concerns about the Middle East and political 
problems in the Soviet Union. The dollar closed at 135.95 yen, up 0.25 yen from 
Friday's close of 135.70 yen. 
</P>
<P>
Financial markets were closed on Monday for a national holiday. Dealers said 
most investors are waiting until next year to make any new moves. "If there 
should be any move, the only possibility is upward for the dollar," said 
Chizuko Satsukawa, a dealer at Chemical Bank. On the Tokyo stock exchange, the 
stronger dollar, lower bond prices and worries about the Persian Gulf and the 
Soviet Union helped push the Nikkei average down 351.72 to 23,767.88 points. 
Investors tend to buy the dollar as a safe haven in times of international 
turmoil. European markets were closed.

PEOPLE: BENNETT BIDWELL LEAVING POST AT CHRYSLER CORP.; 
</P>

DOMESTIC CAR MAKER IN THE LAST YEAR.

<P>
The automotive business is losing one of its last executives who rose through 
the ranks while car making was the king of industry when Bennett E. Bidwell 
retires from a top post at Chrysler Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell, who remains an unabashed, flag-waving fan of American cars, came of 
age when the Big Three didn't worry about imports and no one had heard of a 
catalytic converter. 
</P>
<P>
During 37 years of selling and renting cars, Bidwell eventually took charge of 
Chrysler's car- and truck-making operations as chairman of Chrysler Motors. 
Along the way, he developed a reputation as one of the industry's most colorful 
and outspoken, sometimes profane, executives. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of the month, Bidwell, 63, bids farewell to the industry that has 
fallen a long way since the era when it was, as he says, "king of the world." 
</P>
<P>
He becomes the fourth high-level executive to leave Chrysler during the past 
year. The most notable was former Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald who quit to 
lead an unsuccessful effort by three unions to buy United Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell is leaving when Chrysler is under enormous pressure. Earlier this 
month, California billionaire Kirk Kerkorian disclosed that he bought 9.8% of 
Chrysler's stock, triggering a toughening of the corporation's "poison pill" 
anti-takeover defense. 
</P>
<P>
Even though some analysts think that Chrysler will lose money in 1990 as some 
of its top vehicles suffer slipping sales, Bidwell said he sees Chrysler moving 
purposefully into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
But, peering over his glasses and leaning slightly forward during an interview, 
he said it will perhaps not emerge as the same Chrysler that was rescued from 
near bankruptcy in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"At some point in time, I believe that Chrysler will strengthen its 
international alliances with somebody as part of the competition for the growth 
that's going to occur in markets outside of North America," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell, with his matter-of-fact tone and no-nonsense attitude, apparently has 
been a good fit with Chrysler Chairman Lee A. Iacocca, also known to bluntly 
speak his mind. 
</P>
<P>
Iacocca brought Bidwell to Chrysler in June, 1983, as executive vice president 
for sales, marketing and public affairs. For the two years before that, Bidwell 
had been president and chief operating officer of Hertz Corp. 
</P>
<P>
It was a job he didn't particularly like. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what was really boring," Bidwell said. "That was trying to rent 
cars rather than sell them. It was a good rental company, a leadership company 
and all that." 
</P>
<P>
But there was no pizazz, he said, so he went back into the business of making 
and selling cars. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell's introduction to the automotive industry came in 1953, when he moved 
from a natural gas company in 1953 to Ford Motor Co.'s district sales office in 
Boston. It was a big cultural change -- one he said he doesn't regret. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're an economist with a natural gas company, it's kind of hard to 
strike up a conversation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Conversation is something Bidwell never has shunned. His direct manner is 
appreciated by some, criticized by others. Lately, he's had a particular 
passion for confronting the press. 
</P>
<P>
After lambasting the media for 11 pages in a speech last January, Bidwell, in 
characteristic form, asked rhetorically: "Are we dealing with congenital 
'sickos' here? Or is it true that good news just won't sell papers?" 
</P>
<P>
Journalists had T-shirts made up commemorating the remark and sent a couple to 
Bidwell. Again, in true Bidwell form, he showed up about a month later at an 
Iacocca news conference on 1989 earnings wearing the T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
But Bidwell isn't all bluster. He rose through Ford's marketing operations 
until 1968, when he was named a vice president for Ford Motor Credit Co. 
</P>
<P>
He later served as general manager for Ford's Lincoln-Mercury division, its 
Ford division, sales vice president and vice president of for Ford's North 
American car and truck group. 
</P>
<P>
After the Hertz hiatus, Bidwell returned to selling cars when Iacocca persuaded 
him to come to Chrysler. He became chairman of Chrysler Motors on Nov. 10, 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Bidwell, who plans to keep in touch with Chrysler but not sit on its board 
after he retires, will be doing some non-automotive consulting work with a New 
York company he wouldn't identify. 
</P>
<P>
And he'll be playing some golf, one of his passions. 
</P>
<P>
"The game plan is to be about 55% active," he said.

FIRST PERSON: A BRUSH WITH THE PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARAH WHITE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Sarah White, daughter of the late British 
journalist Sam White and Sheila Pickering White, is office manager and 
researcher for the Paris bureau of the Los Angeles Times. She wrote this 
personal account with the assistance of Times Paris Bureau Chief Rone Tempest.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In 1935, French artist Balthasar Klossovski de Rola -- Balthus -- painted a 
portrait of 17-year-old Sheila Pickering in Paris. The painting disappeared 
soon after. Fifty-five years later, a newspaper ad led Pickering's daughter to 
the valuable artwork, and began her fight to regain the painting and keep it 
off the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
I had heard about Balthus' portrait of my mother many times before I finally 
saw a photograph of it a few weeks ago and began my fight to win it back. 
</P>
<P>
My efforts were ignited by a telephone call from a family friend, telling me 
about a newspaper ad for an auction in Avignon. That call touched off a frantic 
drive to collect documentation proving my claim to the painting, and at one 
point led to a conversation with the artist. 
</P>
<P>
In the years before she died, my mother often talked about the portrait that 
Balthus had given to her in 1935, when she was 17. The painting represented her 
first love, her youth and the exciting life in the bohemian world of art and 
literature in Paris. It disappeared when the family moved from a rented villa 
in the south of France the same year. 
</P>
<P>
She might have gone in search of the work then, but the 1930s was a time of 
great turmoil in Europe. My mother and her brother moved with my grandmother to 
Spain, where the family had roots. Mother and my uncle immediately became 
involved in the civil war against Francisco Franco. She worked as a nurse on 
the Republican side and was jailed for a month in Barcelona before she, her 
mother and brother escaped to England. 
</P>
<P>
Then World War II broke out. As a British citizen -- her father was British 
businessman Robert Pickering -- my mother was unable to return to France until 
1945, when she moved to Paris as the wife of a British diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
Soon after, she went back to Cagnes-sur-Mer, where the family had lived in 
1935, and filed a report with the local police about the missing painting. She 
told me that she even went back to the villa, where she was disappointed to 
discover that the new occupants knew nothing about the missing work. 
</P>
<P>
This was before Balthus had become a celebrated artist whose paintings are now 
priced in the millions of dollars and hang in museums all over the world. 
</P>
<P>
Balthus used my mother as a model for several of his works, one of which, "La 
Montagne," is in the permanent collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 
New York. It is a stunning picture set in the Swiss Alps; she is the figure 
reclining on the grass in the foreground holding a shepherd's crook. 
</P>
<P>
Artist and model shared a fondness for English literature. She posed for his 
illustrations of the classics "Wuthering Heights" and "The Adventures of Alice 
in Wonderland." 
</P>
<P>
Balthus had a nickname for my mother: "Sheila, Princess of Cats." To me, the 
portrait he gave her has a powerful feline quality. The proud expression on the 
face of the girl who became my mother is like the gaze of a cat that has lifted 
its head from a favorite pillow to coolly, almost regally, regard an intruder 
in its domain. 
</P>
<P>
In the portrait, my mother is shown with an open book on her lap. Unusual for 
Balthus, whose works seldom have words, the book is inscribed with the 
following message in large letters: 
</P>
<P>
"An Authentic Portrait of Her Highness, Sheila, Princess of Cats . . . Painted 
by His Majesty, Balthus, the King of Cats Himself." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Balthus, Mother knew many other avant-garde artists and writers. 
Henry Miller inscribed a copy of his then-banned "Tropic of Cancer" to her. 
Another friend for many years was American surrealistic photographer and artist 
Man Ray. 
</P>
<P>
I have a photograph of myself that was taken by Man Ray when I was 4 and given 
to Mother. 
</P>
<P>
It was clear from the fond way in which she talked about this era that Mother 
considered this to be the best, most exciting period of her life. 
</P>
<P>
As the years went by and her health began to fail, the missing painting loomed 
more and more in her mind as a symbol of stolen youth and paradise lost. She 
died in 1978 without ever seeing it again. 
</P>
<P>
That was why it was such a shock to receive the telephone call from the 
longtime family friend. 
</P>
<P>
"Did you see the Herald Tribune Saturday?" she asked. "There's an advertisement 
for an auction that's selling a portrait of your mother." 
</P>
<P>
I quickly leafed through the pages until I reached a section devoted to art 
auctions in France and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly, I was looking directly into Mother's eyes. In the middle of a large 
advertisement for an art auction in Avignon the coming Sunday was a portrait of 
Mother sitting in an armchair. She is wearing what looks like a short-sleeved 
silk blouse and has a book open on her lap. I knew immediately it was the lost 
portrait by Balthus. 
</P>
<P>
It was a chilling, exciting experience. For a few moments my dead mother was 
resurrected before me; I instantly loved the painting. Now that I know it 
exists, I can hardly pass an hour without looking at it. 
</P>
<P>
The ad said it all: The painting was titled "Portrait of Sheila Pickering" and 
painted in 1935 by Balthasar Klossovski de Rola. The advertisement noted that 
Sheila Pickering was also featured in the Balthus painting "La Montagne" at the 
Met. 
</P>
<P>
My immediate reaction, of course, was that I wanted the painting. But when I 
called the auction house in Avignon I was shocked to discover that bidding 
would begin at 2.5 million francs (about $500,000). In an interview, auctioneer 
Jacques Desamais said he hopes to receive up to $3 million for the painting. 
Clearly out of my league. 
</P>
<P>
But after I telephoned Balthus at his home in Rossiniere, Switzerland, I began 
to believe that as the only living heir to Sheila Pickering, I had a legitimate 
claim to the painting. 
</P>
<P>
Balthus, now 82, seemed delighted to hear from me. He remembered Mother fondly 
and told me how disappointed he had been when he heard the painting was for 
sale. He said he had presented the portrait to my mother as a gift, not as 
something to sell. Like me, he said he was afraid that the portrait might be 
purchased by an investor or private company and carted off to Japan or the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
After reminiscing about Mother, Balthus readily offered to give me a letter 
stating that he had, indeed, given the painting to her in 1935 and that it was 
intended as a very personal gift. He said he had considered buying the painting 
himself, just to keep it off the speculative art market, but could not afford 
it. 
</P>
<P>
My uncle and others who remembered the portrait also offered statements 
supporting my claim. With the help of these documents, my attorney was able to 
persuade a judge in Avignon to suspend the auction until the painting's 
ownership is established. 
</P>
<P>
So for the past several weeks, I have been collecting evidence. Unfortunately, 
one key element, the 1945 statement that my mother made to the police in 
Cagnes-sur-Mer, is missing. 
</P>
<P>
At first, I was told that the police archives containing the document had been 
destroyed. Then my lawyers received a report that the archives had not been 
destroyed but had been removed only 15 days before the auction was to take 
place. 
</P>
<P>
Quite understandably, auctioneer Desamais is upset about the court's order to 
suspend the sale. The portrait had been the featured work in his auction, which 
had been advertised extensively in the United States and Japan. He stood to 
gain a handsome commission on an art work that he says had been found in a 
steamer trunk belonging to the father of a Cagnes-sur-Mer police officer, Louis 
Provencal. 
</P>
<P>
Provencal, who works in the same department where Mother filed the original 
complaint, said he found the weathered portrait when he was going through the 
trunk after his father's death. According to accounts in the Cagnes-sur-Mer 
papers, the identity of the artist came to light after the policeman took it to 
a local art curator for evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
After Balthus confirmed that it was his work and authenticated its restoration, 
the painting was given to Desamais for sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I contacted the art theft division of the Ministry of Interior," Desamais said 
in a newspaper interview, "where no claim concerning the theft of this painting 
had been recorded. Moreover, the archives of the Cagnes-sur-Mer Police 
Department dating from before the war have been destroyed. According to French 
law, Monsieur Provencal must be considered as the owner in good faith of this 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"The decision of the court (to suspend the auction) is very severe and deals me 
a gross prejudice because the restoration of the portrait of Sheila Pickering 
took six months of work. Also, I did a lot of publicity for this sale, getting 
in touch with potential buyers that were supposed to come from Japan and the 
United States." 
</P>
<P>
Although I have read dozens of news stories over the years involving bitter 
fights over precious art works, I never imagined myself as a participant. 
</P>
<P>
But I know that if Mother were alive, she would be fighting tooth and nail for 
her painting. I remember sitting with her on dozens of occasions in the drawing 
room or the kitchen of our apartment on the Rue du Bac in Paris, talking about 
the portrait. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes she would blame her mother, my grandmother, for not protecting the 
painting. At other times she would blame the circumstances of history: the 
succession of civil war, war and occupation that prevented her from returning 
to Cagnes-sur-Mer after she discovered that the painting was missing. 
</P>
<P>
When I think about those who would keep this painting from me, I think about 
the inscription that Balthus put on the face of the painting, dedicating it to 
Mother, "Princess of Cats." If there has ever been a more personal message on a 
painting than that, indicating an exchange between giver and receiver, artist 
and model, lover and his young mistress, I would like someone to show it to me.

Wish List: Philippines former first lady Imelda Marcos on Tuesday made a 
holiday appeal to go home from exile in Hawaii. "You can be sure that with your 
former first lady, former mother of the country, when I come home, Christmas 
will not be for a day. 
</P>
<P>
I will make it Christmas every day," she said in a statement sent to 
Philippines media. The government refused to allow the late President Ferdinand 
Marcos and his family to return from Hawaii, where they fled when he was ousted 
in 1986.

* Best Friend: The Wisconsin Humane Society will honor Rep. Les Aspin (D-Wis.) 
for helping a stray dog he spotted on a Milwaukee freeway Dec. 2. Aspin picked 
up the spaniel and unsuccessfully searched the surrounding neighborhood for its 
owner. He then cared for the dog until its owner responded to a newspaper 
advertisement appeal. 
</P>
<P>
* Tables Turned: Advice columnist Dr. Ruth Westheimer has been discussing other 
people's private lives for years. But now a little secret about Dr. Ruth 
herself is out: She doesn't sleep in the same bed with her husband, Fred. The 
tidbit was revealed when the couple booked a Caribbean cruise, asking for 
separate beds. Dr. Ruth pooh-poohed the whole thing, saying it's just that Fred 
snores too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
* No Papering Over: The Ronald Reagan Library is nearing completion near Simi 
Valley with a target date of Feb. 6, the former President's 80th birthday, but 
it looks as though his papers won't be available for a number of years. 
Reagan's White House papers are the property of the federal government, and the 
National Archives has five years to process them. Until Reagan, former 
Presidents owned their papers, except for Richard M. Nixon, whose documents 
were made government property by special legislation after the Watergate 
scandal.

SCREEN STYLE: THE DON OF A PINKIE RING REVIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The film: "The Godfather, Part III," directed by Francis Ford Coppola. 
</P>
<P>
The setup: In the third of a series of Corleone family bloodlettings, an aged 
Michael Corleone (Al Pacino, pictured) passes the ring of don succession to 
nephew Vincent Mancini (Andy Garcia, pictured), the bastard son of Sonny. 
</P>
<P>
The look: Pacino navigates the treacherous waters of legit business deals and 
underworld intrigue in exquisitely tailored double-breasted suits of no 
distinct period. Garcia, who is lusting after Corleone's daughter, Mary (Sophia 
Coppola), tries to win his uncle's respect by changing his personal style from 
that of flamboyant-stud-thug to sophisticated-macho-upper-management type. He 
makes his first entrance in a zoot suit-sized black leather jacket, but by the 
film's end, he is wearing a custom-made tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
George Hamilton cuts a sartorial swath through the film as the Corleone family 
lawyer. His clothes are more colorful and his jewelry is a brighter shade of 
gold than the other men's. He wears ascots and coats with velvet collars. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Corleone (Diane Keaton), who left Michael years ago and has remarried a 
very upright WASP gent, is present in this film's pivotal scenes, modestly 
covered from earlobes to kneecaps, wearing nondescript clothes in shades of 
brown and beige with high-necked white blouses. Connie Corleone (Talia Shire), 
the shrill, blood-thirsty matriarch of the clan, orders hits and plots revenge 
in larger-than-life, Martha Graham-sized jewelry and dowdy dresses. 
</P>
<P>
The details: The film is set in 1979, not that you'd notice from the clothes. 
The styles range from '40s-suit styles to '80s evening wear and accessories. 
Mileana Canonero, the costume designer, explains that rigidly adhering to a 
time period is not the point of this film: "It's not about frocks. It is about 
the essence of operatic tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
Age and hierarchy of power within the men's ranks is suggested by the choice of 
their ties. The oldest generation of now-retired dons wears foulards, while 
Pacino and his peers wear paisley and rich, tapestry-like prints. The young 
guns are put in more eye-catching abstract florals. 
</P>
<P>
Al Pacino is willing to do anything for the part. He let the makeup people thin 
his hair on top so he would look older. It was then streaked with gray and cut 
short in a modified military brush cut. Canonero said they chose that 
particular haircut for Pacino from a selection of styles composed on a computer 
video screen. 
</P>
<P>
The good: The principal males, except for Hamilton, have gorgeous wardrobes of 
cashmere suits with coordinating overcoats that Canonero had made in the Verri 
workshops in Italy. (Verri recently opened a store on Rodeo Drive.) Her 
insistence on dressing the men in a single solid color with subtle differences 
in shading -- a brown suit with a beige shirt would be topped with a dark brown 
overcoat -- she says, was an attempt to create the "look of a Renaissance 
painting. It gave importance to the face. The body was more in unison with the 
background." 
</P>
<P>
It also sets off all the gold jewelry. The monochromatic coloring, tasteful 
jewelry and indistinct suit styles -- wide, peak lapels from the '40s, 
contemporary jacket tailoring and easy-fitting, draped trousers -- are quite 
appealing. 
</P>
<P>
The bad: The women's knee-length dresses are a quick reminder of why designers 
seem to prefer hemlines either above or below the knee. Mid-leg is not a good 
proportion. The biggest fashion risk, though, was Shire's breast plate-sized 
necklaces with beads the size of golf balls. 
</P>
<P>
The familiar: For her big scene, Sophia Coppola bares her shoulders in a 
ballet-length gold gown and gold flats reminiscent of those by Italian designer 
Romeo Gigli. So are Keaton's garments for the same scene: an embroidered cocoon 
coat and high-necked velvet dress. Canonero claims Sophia's style was developed 
from Victorian pictorial references to Shakespeare's Juliet, but concedes the 
similarity and suggests they are not as exaggerated as Gigli's creations. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff: This movie may do more for the men's gold jewelry business -- 
collar bars, lapel pins and, yes, even pinkie rings -- than did "Saturday Night 
Fever." GAILE ROBINSON

Manufacturers offered a wide range of innovative products for consumers this 
year. Some are new; some old, but improved. From 1990's columns we've selected 
what we believe are the year's 10 best, in no particular order. See what you 
think. 
</P>

StarLace is a learning product that helps teach children (ages 4 and older) how 
to tie shoelaces. It's a colorful elastic band with ready-to-tie laces -- one 
red, one white to differentiate right from left -- that fits over the shoe and 
keeps the laces from slipping. 
</P>
<P>
Developed by a Diamond Bar consultant in child psychology, StarLace features 
stiffer than normal laces that don't droop so children can manipulate them more 
easily. 
</P>
<P>
On each lace is a positioning star, so children can begin tying laces by 
putting the stars together; then parents and youngsters can follow the 
step-by-step procedures on an illustrated, accompanying poster. Velcro-like 
strips on the inside also help the laces stay together while the child is 
learning to tie the knot. 
</P>
<P>
StarLace (suggested retail price, $9.95) is available in the children's shoe 
department at Nordstrom in Glendale, Brea, Cerritos and South Coast Plaza in 
Costa Mesa. Or write to Dr. Deann Toys, 3333 Brea Canyon Road, Suite 124, 
Diamond Bar, Calif. 91765. 
</P>
<P>
Sports fans, opera lovers or bird watchers will enjoy Perma Focus binoculars, 
with which you can see everything from 40 feet to infinity in sharp focus. And 
you don't have to adjust them manually; they focus automatically when you look 
through them. 
</P>
<P>
The secret is in their optical elements, "engineered to make use of the eye's 
natural ability to focus," according to a representative of Jason Empire, the 
Overland Park, Kan., manufacturer. Perma Focus has several models with 
different magnification powers. All are lightweight, and range in price from 
$70 to $170. 
</P>
<P>
The binoculars are sold nationwide in camera stores and chain stores, including 
Fedco, K mart, Montgomery Ward, Sears, Service Merchandise and Target. Or, 
contact Jason Empire Inc., 9200 Cody, Box 14930, Overland Park, Kan. 66214; 
(800) 255-6366.

SuperMatch fire-starters from Diamond Brands, the Minnesota-based company that 
has been making matches since 1881, provide a handy way to start a fireplace 
fire or barbecue without using kindling or liquid-fuel starter. 
</P>
<P>
SuperMatch is made of compressed sawdust and wax, as are some other 
fire-starters on the market. But each SuperMatch has its own match head on one 
end so you can light it on the striker surface of the matchbox like an ordinary 
safety match. Each stick will burn about 12 minutes, long enough to get a log 
fire or charcoal started. 
</P>
<P>
SuperMatches (about $1.59 for a seven-match box) are available nationwide in 
supermarkets, mass merchandise outlets and drugstores. In Southern California, 
they're carried by Vons, Lucky and Alpha Beta markets. For more information, 
contact Diamond Brands Western Regional Sales Office, 1820 Orangewood Ave., 
Suite 101, Orange, Calif. 92668, (714) 385-1530; or Diamond Brands headquarters 
in Minneapolis, (612) 541-1500.

Sherry's Miracle stain solution is a nontoxic, water-based stain remover for 
carpet and upholstery that also deodorizes the soiled area as it removes the 
stain. It also can be used on clothing, but should be color-fast tested first 
on an inconspicuous area of the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
This stain remover is the most effective we've seen. If used as directed, it 
takes out such tough-to-remove things as pet stains, blood, food, grass, 
iodine, coffee, tea, wine, ketchup, grease, oil stains, most shoe polish, 
crayon, latex paint, chocolate and raw egg. 
</P>
<P>
To order -- $10, plus $2.50 shipping and handling for 16 ounces; $1.50, 50 
shipping, for a two-ounce trial size -- contact Sherry's Miracle, P.O. Box 201, 
12115 Magnolia Blvd., North Hollywood, Calif. 91607; (818) 995-8503.

The Recycling File system provides an easy way to sort and store recyclable 
items -- paper, glass and aluminum -- at home or office. 
</P>
<P>
The file consists of three reusable vinyl storage bags hanging from a 
17-by-18-by-27-inch white PVC rack. The washable bags slide easily from the 
rack so they can be carried to curbside or a recycling center, and come in a 
choice of white, black, gray, blue or dark green. 
</P>
<P>
The system (retail, $50 to $55) is available nationwide through Nature Co. 
stores and catalogue, at the Earth Store in Westwood and OP 266 (formerly 
Organizer's Paradise) in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills. If you can't find it in 
your area, you can buy it ($49.95, plus $4 shipping and handling) from the 
manufacturer: Bring Your Own Bag (BYOB), P.O. Box 289, Cardiff-by-the-Sea, 
Calif. 92007; (800) 334-BYOB.

If you can't stand the smell of mothballs, Moth-Away is a moth-repellent made 
of natural herbs, not chemicals. It comes in a sachet and has a fresh herbal 
scent; you don't have to air out your clothes for days to get rid of mothball 
odor. 
</P>
<P>
One box -- which contains 24 packets -- protects clothing in three 
standard-size garment bags for up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
Moth-Away (suggested retail $4.95 per box) is available throughout Southern 
California at Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Long's Drugs and Stroud's stores. Or you 
can order it from Richards Homewares Inc., P.O. Box 92019, Long Beach, Calif. 
90809; (213) 424-8671. Add $2.95 for postage and handling (up to six boxes). 
</P>
<P>
Nuwick is a candle in a can that will burn about 120 hours, so it's great for 
camping, boating and other recreational uses or for emergencies. Nuwick has six 
separate, movable wicks that can be used and reused -- for light or cooking. 
</P>
<P>
The 14-ounce candle comes in a sturdy metal can that won't tip over, and it can 
be stored almost anywhere. Nuwick is made of a specially formulated, 
low-temperature paraffin that is slow burning and nontoxic. There are no smelly 
fumes, and it won't liquefy if sitting flat. 
</P>
<P>
The waterproof wicks can be moved around the top of the wax with a tweezer, 
which is included in the candle kit along with a pack of safety matches. 
</P>
<P>
Nuwick (suggested retail price, about $9.95) is available nationwide in drug, 
sporting goods and camping stores. In Southern California, it's sold at Super 
Drugs in Westwood, the Outdoorsman in Lancaster, Surplus Store on Venice 
Boulevard in Los Angeles, Gerald's Hardware in Westchester and 14 REI 
(Recreational Equipment Inc.) stores. If you can't find the candle in your 
area, contact Nuwick Inc., P.O. Box 7962, Van Nuys, Calif. 91409; (213) 
396-3135 or (800) 347-WICK.

A Maryland doctor has invented Handaids, disposable lightweight plastic gloves 
filled with moisturizing cream that help soothe chapped hands and heal split 
cuticles. 
</P>
<P>
The soft gloves mold to your hands and act like a mini-sauna, holding in body 
heat and allowing the pores of the skin to absorb the lotion, which is made of 
petroleum, aloe and vitamins A and E. Because there's no lotion outside the 
gloves, they are not messy; you can read a paper or book while moisturizing you 
hands or even wear them to bed. 
</P>
<P>
To order Handaids ($8.95, plus $2.50 for postage and handling for a box of 
seven pairs; 21 pairs for $26, plus $3.50 shipping and handling), send a check 
or money order to O &amp; L Inc., P.O. Box 1227, Bristol, Pa. 19007; (215) 
785-2220. 
</P>
<P>
Canadian inventor Norman Rolston has developed Able Walker to help give 
mobility to senior citizens and others who need assistance in walking. The 
chrome, lightweight (15 pounds) Able Walker is not only a walking aid, but also 
a grocery cart or a seat that can hold up to 500 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
Walker height is adjustable -- it can be used by a 4-foot, 10-inch child or a 
6-foot, 6-inch adult. It is fitted with handlebars covered with foam grips, 
four wheels, hand brakes and the shopping basket that converts to a seat. 
Locking buttons on the handlebars will keep it stationary when you want to sit. 
The walker also can be turned into a luggage cart by removing the basket and 
turning a hinge at the bottom of the walker. 
</P>
<P>
Able Walker ($299, including shipping and handling) basically comes in one 
piece; all you do is attach the brakes. To order, contact Able Walker Inc., 
Bldg. C-2, 1122 Fir Ave., Blaine, Wash., 98230; (800) 663-1305.

2 MORE KILLED NEAR FREEWAY CHECKPOINT 
</P>

<P>
Shortly before midnight on Christmas Eve, a 37-year-old Mexican woman and her 
teen-age companion were struck by vehicles and killed along Interstate 5 north 
of here as they tried to cross the busy freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Both were presumed to have been illegal aliens attempting to evade inspection 
at the U.S. Border Patrol checkpoint at San Onofre, in northern San Diego 
County just south of the Orange County line. Their deaths raised to 15 the 
number of immigrant pedestrians killed on the freeway this year, exceeding last 
year's record of 14, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Since 1987, according to the California Highway Patrol, at least 65 northbound 
immigrants en route to the Los Angeles area and beyond have been hit -- 40 of 
them killed -- while attempting to hike around the busy checkpoint. The trek is 
a hazardous undertaking that often involves two crossings of eight lanes of 
high-speed traffic in a poorly lighted area where few motorists expect to see 
pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
The ongoing carnage has prompted California transportation authorities to post 
warning signs, caution lights and take other measures aimed at alerting 
motorists and pedestrians to the danger. But the injuries and deaths keep on 
mounting. 
</P>
<P>
Just last week, the California Department of Transportation announced that it 
planned to erect a $10-million, 8-mile-long chain-link fence in the freeway 
median -- the most dramatic step to date aimed at reducing the bloodshed. But 
the fence plan itself has engendered intense opposition, as many immigrant 
advocates fear that the planned barrier could actually increase the human toll 
by leaving helpless immigrant pedestrians trapped in the middle of the busy 
roadway. 
</P>
<P>
The two latest victims, both believed to be Mexican citizens, were struck by a 
southbound sedan at 11:54 p.m. Christmas Eve, according to the CHP. One died at 
the scene while the other succumbed three hours later at an Orange County 
hospital, authorities said. They were both struck at a site along Interstate 5 
about 2 miles north of the Las Pulgas Road exit, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP officials say the driver, identified as Gretchen Carter, 21, of San Diego, 
had no chance to stop and was not at fault. She was driving her 1976 Oldsmobile 
sedan at about 55 m.p.h. in the far right southbound lane, authorities said, 
and did not see the victims until it was too late. The driver was uninjured, 
officials said, although her car was badly damaged and had to be towed away. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 15 deaths this year, at least nine others have been hit 
since January and survived, authorities say, cementing 1990's ignominious 
status as the bloodiest to date for immigrant pedestrians in the area. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego County medical examiner's office identified one victim as Elva 
Valdes Lopez, 37, of the Mexican state of Michoacan. She was dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
The second victim, a woman who was believed to have been a teen-ager, was taken 
by paramedics to Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. She 
was pronounced dead there at 2:45 a.m., according to William King, a deputy 
Orange County coroner. 
</P>
<P>
There was no definitive identification of the other woman, King said. But the 
San Diego County medical examiner's office tentatively identified the dead girl 
as Del Carmen Valdez Hidalgo, 15, also of the Mexican state of Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
Birth certificates were found among the victims' belongings, King said, a fact 
that may facilitate definitive identification. Often, illegal aliens carry 
little or no identifying paperwork; some pedestrian victims have never been 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
It was not known if the two women were related, coroner's officials said. They, 
like other past victims, were presumed to be headed to reunions with family 
members or friends in the Los Angeles area or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Both bodies will remain in county morgues until claimed by relatives, 
authorities aid. As of late Christmas Day, no family members had inquired about 
the two, officials said. The Mexican consulate in San Diego will be enlisted to 
assist in the search for relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no ideas who their families are," said William Leard, deputy San Diego 
County coroner. "We just put the names out and hope that someone comes 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego County is a major migratory corridor for illegal aliens arriving from 
Mexico. Area freeways are often used by northbound immigrants, who frequently 
travel on foot or are dropped off along the freeway by smugglers driving 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
The portion of Interstate 5 near the Border Patrol checkpoint is one of two 
major problem areas involving immigrant pedestrians in the San Diego area. The 
other -- and more hazardous -- danger zone for immigrant pedestrians is near 
the actual U.S.-Mexico boundary strip, about 75 miles south of the checkpoint. 
There, officials say that at least 158 immigrant pedestrians have been struck 
since 1987, including 87 who died.

O.C. CITIES HARVEST HISTORY BY SAVING GROVES, FARMS; 
</P>
<P>
LIFESTYLE: A ONCE-AGRARIAN SOCIETY WANTS ITS CHILDREN TO KNOW THE SCENT OF 
ORANGE BLOSSOMS IN THE AIR.

<P>
When Bob Hoyt was mayor, he spent a lot of time explaining to schoolchildren 
why their city was called Orange when not a single orange grove was growing 
within its borders. 
</P>
<P>
"That got me to thinking," said Hoyt, a councilman from 1966 to 1980. "So I 
went to the parks department and said I wanted an orange grove. They laughed, 
but I said, no, I'm serious. Everyone thought planting an orange grove was sort 
of a silly thing, and I had to get real insistent about it." 
</P>
<P>
To satisfy the mayor, the city searched for a good spot and, in 1975, planted 
about an acre of Valencia orange trees in W.O. Hart Park on Glassell Street. It 
is the only orange grove in the city, and one of only a few thousand acres of 
citrus left in the entire county. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Orange was the county's first municipal farmer. But now, other 
cities that are rapidly losing their agricultural heritage are creating similar 
living museums by purchasing orange groves and farms. 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano is in the process of buying the 56-acre Kinoshita farm, 
located in the heart of the city, for $9.5 million. And the city of Irvine has 
begun appraising a 16-acre orange grove owned by the Irvine Co. in an effort to 
save it from development. 
</P>
<P>
The local leaders said they are going into the farming business to ensure that 
the fruit that gave Orange County its name isn't relegated solely to grocery 
store shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"This was an agrarian economy, and I think it's vitally important to remember 
the history here," said San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer. "On the 
West Coast and especially Southern California, we have lost some of the 
character and qualities that drew people here in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
Most of Orange County's cropland disappeared in the 1960s, when the heart of 
the county was developed. In 1959, about 123,000 acres were harvested, 
including 37,000 acres of citrus groves. By 1969, more than half of those had 
been converted to housing tracts, highways and shopping centers. Now, only 
about 18,000 acres of crops remain, including only about 4,200 acres of citrus. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County's $250 million-a-year agricultural industry includes nursery 
stock, strawberries, avocados and row-crop vegetables such as asparagus, bell 
peppers, cauliflower and cabbage, as well as the citrus groves for which the 
county was once famous. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt, whose grandparents were orange growers, missed the sweet aroma of orange 
blossoms that filled his hometown before the groves were cut down to make room 
for subdivisions and shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
Like other children growing up in Orange, Hoyt, 67, used to pick oranges for 
pennies per crate. The city also had the world's largest packinghouse, but all 
the groves disappeared by the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole city used to live off the crop," Hoyt said. "It was a glorious place 
to live in those days. Now when I'm gone, it's still going to be sitting there 
as a reminder of what we had here once." 
</P>
<P>
John Ellis, a deputy agricultural commissioner for Orange County, likes the 
idea of government buying groves and farms not only for its aesthetic and 
nostalgic appeal, but for its educational value. 
</P>
<P>
"I talk to my own kids about growing and farming, but they don't relate a jar 
of pickles to a cucumber. To them, milk comes from a store," Ellis said. "So if 
they can get a firsthand impression of an orange and how it is grown, they'll 
have an appreciation of where their orange juice came from." 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano decided in October to buy the Kinoshita farm, which is 
surrounded by residential areas and schools, so the family wouldn't sell the 
area's last farm field to developers. The deal between the city and the farming 
family is expected to close by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't fair to keep telling him he couldn't sell his land. We had to let 
him sell or buy it from him," Hausdorfer said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will come from a $21-million open space bond issue approved 
by voters in April. 
</P>
<P>
Preserving a vegetable field or orange grove isn't just a matter of shelling 
out the money to plant it or buy it. It takes a real farmer to harvest those 
crops or orchards, irrigate and fertilize them properly, prune them and ward 
off pests, diseases and freezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
"Farming is hard work," Ellis said. "It's expensive to cultivate and irrigate 
orange groves. Some years you show profit, some you don't. It's a hard 
business. And they may lose money if they don't know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
"If you just want the aesthetic appeal of orange trees, that's a different 
goal, and more easily obtainable. But if you want production, it takes a 
knowledgeable management program." 
</P>
<P>
Orange Mayor Gene Beyer said the Orange grove, which was dedicated to Hoyt, 
isn't as well-tended and healthy as it should be. Many of the trees look 
scraggly and sick, as if they weren't being tended properly. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to work on that," Beyer said. "We've had some problems with trees 
there. I know how hard it is to maintain orange trees just in my own back 
yard." 
</P>
<P>
San Juan Capistrano officials won't even try to manage the Kinoshita Farm 
crops, which are mostly corn, lettuce and strawberries. Instead, the city plans 
to lease the land back to the Kinoshita family. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't afford to run a full-scale farm," he said. "The city will be the 
farmer, and we would pay wages to the people actually farming. But any profits 
would go back to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Also, as part of its new plan to preserve 140 acres of open space, San Juan 
Capistrano expects to buy and preserve some orange groves too. Many of the 
orange groves are dying from lack of attention, but the city hopes to save at 
least a few acres. 
</P>
<P>
"We would be doing it to preserve history and an overall quality of life rather 
than make it economically viable," Hausdorfer said. "But you have to be willing 
to spend the time and the money to manage it right. If you just let nature take 
its course, the trees will be dead. So there has to be a community feeling and 
support." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine officials don't want to lose money on their proposal, so they are 
studying the viability of managing a grove, including the cost of irrigation, 
pest control and security fencing. They also plan to explore the various 
options for operating it, such as leasing it back to Treasure Farms, which 
manages the Irvine Co.'s agricultural fields, or maintaining it as a historic 
park. 
</P>
<P>
The grove in question, on Jeffrey Road south of the Santa Ana Freeway, has been 
slated for development. The Irvine Co. has said it is open to negotiations, and 
the city and developer have jointly hired an appraiser. 
</P>
<P>
The money for the grove would come from $4 million the city is getting from 
Proposition 70, a state bond measure that set aside money for open space. 
</P>
<P>
Hoyt said he is happy to see other cities finally appreciating his idea. In 
Orange 15 years ago, "it was a very inexpensive thing. The lands were already 
there, and all we had to do was plant them." 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of the county's high land costs, preservation has become a much 
more costly and difficult venture involving millions of dollars and complex 
real estate negotiations. But some city officials say the nostalgia and quality 
of life the purchases bring are priceless. 
</P>
<P>
"People love the fact that we can still do some farming locally," Hausdorfer 
said. "Our city's philosophy is to preserve part of our past, and if you lose 
(farmland), then you have generations of young people who have simply no idea 
what happened here years before." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Vanishing Farmland 
</P>
<P>
Agricultural acreage has declined dramatically in Orange County since the surge 
of development began in the 1950's. The dwindling acreage is prompting several 
cities to preserve groves or farms to retain their agricultural heritage.

FINDING HOMES FOR ROMANIA'S 'UNSALVAGEABLES'; 
</P>
<P>
ADOPTION: AN ENCINITAS MAN'S JOURNEY YIELDS RELEASE OF HANDICAPPED CHILDREN TO 
BE PLACED WITH U.S. FAMILIES.

<P>
John Upton remembers the place called the Institute for the Unsalvageables. 
</P>
<P>
He can still see the hundreds of orphaned children who each day are herded 
half-naked onto a urine-covered floor in a room with no heat. He sees their 
faces, sees their eyes calling out to him, their mouths contorted in confusion. 
</P>
<P>
And the smells of the place are still so strong, he says, he can almost taste 
them. 
</P>
<P>
The images Upton carries from a recent visit to a Romanian orphanage aren't 
confined to memory. The award-winning filmmaker has them committed to videotape 
-- taken with a hand-held camera he carried by his side. 
</P>
<P>
And now the 34-year-old Encinitas man is playing the video at his Olivenhain 
home for couples interested in adopting a physically limited Romanian child -- 
boys and girls with Down's syndrome, dwarfism, cerebral palsy and multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
This is a story about a man who saw a network news show about children 
suffering in some faraway place and didn't just turn off the set when the 
broadcast was through. He went to Romania. 
</P>
<P>
Within four days of seeing an October segment of ABC's "20/20," Upton was in 
Bucharest meeting with Communist government officials to see about gaining the 
release of a group of children he admits stole his heart. 
</P>
<P>
"Being a television producer, you learn pretty quick how to get to the bottom 
of things real fast," said Upton, who this year won an Emmy Award for an 
after-school special on teen-age promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
"There just wasn't any doubt in my mind that I could do something, that I could 
make a difference with these kids. But I didn't waste much time thinking about 
it. I just went." 
</P>
<P>
And now, after spending more than five weeks in the Eastern European country, 
sorting through reams of red tape and countless setbacks, Upton has already 
secured homes for five Romanian orphans. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning next spring, he will bring back to Southern California what he hopes 
will be scores more children -- while he helps them begin their search for new 
American homes. 
</P>
<P>
In less than two months, the father of three has become a one-man American 
clearinghouse for handicapped Romanian orphans. And Upton says he will take a 
one-year hiatus from filmmaking to continue his work -- while he sees just how 
many children he can rescue from a system he says has given up on them. 
</P>
<P>
The scenes he plays out now have characters like Elena Rosta, a 12-year-old 
girl whose deformed leg juts out almost backward so that her toes point toward 
her head. And 15-year-old Anna Ostos, an autistic blind girl who longs to sing 
a song with her hero -- Stevie Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
There's Isador, the little boy with the crooked leg who pulled on Upton's 
sleeve at the orphanage and pleaded, "Take me to America." And there's a 
20-year-old dwarf who has been confined to a bed all his life. 
</P>
<P>
For years, they were nobody's children. 
</P>
<P>
"There he is, he's my main man," Upton said of the dwarf child Monday morning 
as he watched his videotape in a neighbor's living room. "I'm just going to 
work on this project for as long as I can so I can get a kid like this a home, 
get him out of his crib. So he can have a life." 
</P>
<P>
Upton's 6,000-mile journey, he admits, began as a quest for Elena. 
</P>
<P>
One Friday night in October, while writing the scripts for a new television 
project, he and his wife, Suzanne, saw a network news special about conditions 
in Romanian orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
Upton recalls being speechless as he watched. He paced the floor as he saw 
images of little Elena, who dragged her deformed body across a dirty floor and 
who flinched on-camera as a nurse hovered over her. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife just looked at me and said, 'You're going, aren't you?' I said, 'Yes I 
am.' I was ready to do anything to get that little girl out of there, even if I 
had to adopt her myself." 
</P>
<P>
The following morning, Upton was at the Encinitas home of Dr. Roger Schmitt, 
chief of orthopedics at Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla. The physician 
reviewed a tape of the program and said he could repair the girl's leg. 
</P>
<P>
On Monday -- armed with a letter from Schmitt and a local dentist who vowed to 
perform free dental work on the child -- he was on a plane for Bucharest. 
</P>
<P>
Upton admits having preconceived notions of the Eastern Bloc country that only 
months before had liberated itself from dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. And that 
notion was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"I went in there with the attitude of the angry American, someone who was going 
to set right the wrongs he found," Upton recalled. "I expected heartless 
officials and corruption. But that's not what I found at all. I found people 
who wanted to act but were handicapped by a lack of resources." 
</P>
<P>
He recalled interviewing the president of a Romanian television company, asking 
why there hadn't already been an expose about orphanage conditions. The 
executive showed Upton evidence that there was indeed such a project in the 
works. 
</P>
<P>
But the work took time, Upton was told. After all, there was only one camera 
for the station's coverage of the entire country. 
</P>
<P>
He found himself getting angry instead at Western nonprofit agencies and church 
ministries that he says intended to use the plight of the orphans as a 
fund-raising ploy, Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a woman who owns a Christian television station stand there and throw 
shoes on the ground so she could watch the children scamper for them -- and, of 
course, get it all on tape," he said. "I decided pretty early to distance 
myself from that kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
With the help of an interpreter, Upton met with Romania's ministers of health 
and labor to secure permission to visit Elena's orphanage in the small northern 
town of Sighetu Murmatiei, near the Soviet border. 
</P>
<P>
By Upton's estimate, more than 100,000 orphans are kept in more than 60 
national orphanages like the one he visited -- many of them misdiagnosed as 
mentally ill, condemned to a life in a place like the Institute for the 
Unsalvageables. 
</P>
<P>
He remembers the moment he first laid eyes on Elena. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought she was absolutely gorgeous," Upton recalled. "She has impeccable 
bone structure. And she responded to my affection. I tickled her, and she 
touched me back. 
</P>
<P>
"She stuck her finger up my nose and in my mouth. All those kids were like 
that. You got the feeling that they had never really been touched in their 
lives before." 
</P>
<P>
Upton returned to the orphanage several times during his stay, once with a 
Romanian doctor who told him that Elena was severely retarded and might not 
even respond to physical therapy. But he was still determined to bring her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
He also learned that Romanian law required that to gain an orphaned child's 
release, his birth parents as well as a judge must sign them off. And there lay 
the root of Upton's frustrations. 
</P>
<P>
Despite weeks of searching the "Gypsy country" of rural Romania, he could not 
find the parents of either Elena or two other children he intended on bringing 
back to Encinitas. 
</P>
<P>
"I came back and told myself, 'Well, you've failed. Five weeks in the country, 
and you can't bring one child home with you.' " 
</P>
<P>
That's when he met the mother 
</P>
<P>
of Anna Ostos. 
</P>
<P>
She was a big woman, Upton recalled. One day she appeared at the orphanage. The 
mother of two other blind children as well as two healthy offspring, she told 
Upton to take her daughter to America for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
But she had one other demand, he recalled. "She told me, 'By the way, my 
daughter loves to sing, and she loves Stevie Wonder. So you take her to see 
Stevie Wonder so they can sing together," Upton recalled. 
</P>
<P>
"I told her that I didn't hang out with stars like Stevie Wonder. I just make 
my little films. But she just said, 'You will find Stevie Wonder.' " 
</P>
<P>
So Upton and Anna Ostos returned to San Diego County. His first day back, he 
called Wonder's agent and sent a tape of the girl's singing. Recently, Wonder 
agreed to meet with Anna, Upton said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the search goes on for the parents of children like Elena Rosta and 
Isador, the boy with the crooked leg. If they aren't found soon, Upton said, 
the Romanian police could legally sign the children off, clearing the way for 
their release. 
</P>
<P>
But when he returned home just before Thanksgiving, Upton found that others had 
been affected by what they had seen of the Institute of the Unsalvageables. 
</P>
<P>
Paul and Debra Langness of Encinitas saw the network program and expressed 
interest in adopting Elena. So the first of Upton's children had found a home. 
</P>
<P>
Then he heard from Walter Moorehead of Los Angeles who also wanted to adopt the 
child. "When he found that Elena had been spoken for," Upton said, "he offered 
to pay the $5,000 to cover the adoption expenses." 
</P>
<P>
And so the search goes on. A woman from Louisiana has expressed interest in the 
dwarf boy. And several other couples who have watched Upton's video began 
proceedings to adopt. 
</P>
<P>
In all, he says, 28 couples have expressed interest in adopting children from 
the Romanian orphanages. 
</P>
<P>
Anna Ostos, however, is still without a home. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, she's going to stay," Upton said. "If she has to, she can stay with us." 
</P>
<P>
Upton says he plans to return to Romania in March to secure the release of more 
children. He realizes that there may be a narrow window of opportunity in the 
ever-changing political climate in Romania. So he plans to work fast. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can secure the release of about 10 children a month," he said. "I'm 
just going to pull out as many as I can." 
</P>
<P>
And he hopes his efforts will draw attention to the issue of adoption in San 
Diego County and throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, if a guy like me can do something like this, anyone can," he said. "And 
not just in Romania. There are children right here in our back yard who need 
homes as well." 
</P>
<P>
Mostly, though, John Upton plans on keeping his promise to children like 
Isabella, a 17-year-old who suffers from cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
"The day before I left, I gave her a teddy bear. And I told her: 'Keep this 
little bear warm. And by Easter, I'll be back for you.' That's what I promised 
her. And I plan on keeping my word."

Romania's former King Michael was deported less than 12 hours after arriving in 
Bucharest on his first visit since Communist rulers forced him to abdicate 43 
years ago. Michael, 69, had returned a year after the revolution that saw the 
ouster and execution of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. Michael was forced to 
return to Switzerland, where he lives in exile.

CHRISTMAS WISHES COME TRUE, BUT ONLY FOR SOME; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: THE SEASON'S MAGIC SPRINGS TO LIFE FOR MANY SOUTHLAND CHILDREN, WHILE 
OTHERS FEEL LONELY AND BEREFT.

Christmas is, above all, a children's holiday. For them Dec. 25, 1990, in 
Southern California was a time of sophistication and innocence, of piety and 
materialism, of poverty and wealth, of family ties and loneliness, against a 
backdrop of varied ethnic groups and faiths: 
</P>
<P>
The beige stucco house in Monterey Park where Bea Hernandez lives is on a 
corner lot. But even with the extra swath of lawn, 17 grandchildren fill up the 
front yard. And for Christmas, of course, every one was there. 
</P>
<P>
They helped polish off the tamales, 24 dozen of them. Depending on the 
children's ages, they frolicked on the grass or clung to mothers' legs. Some 
flashed smiles punctuated with braces; others revealed gaps where front teeth 
had fallen out. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter how old, they shared one abiding belief: Santa Claus had indeed 
come to town the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Alexia Bravo, 5, reported having seen "something red by the fireplace" in the 
living room Christmas Eve. "He left me a pretty ballerina," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Her brother Mike, 14, received a fishing pole Christmas morning and was not a 
bit surprised. "I wrote to Santa Claus that I have been good and that I wanted 
a fishing pole. I gave it to my mom," he said. "She said she mailed it." 
</P>
<P>
She must have. 
</P>
<P>
For Peter Yung, Cindy Luu, Tom Huey -- all 16 -- and Fred Chow, 15, Christmas 
brunch was fast-food fried chicken in Alhambra. 
</P>
<P>
For Zalmy Berkowitz, 7, lunch on Christmas day meant a trip to the big city 
from Huntington Beach for kosher pizza in the heart of the Fairfax District. 
</P>
<P>
For Jessica Kaye, 8, Christmas dinner was ham, scalloped potatoes, hot baked 
rolls and a choice of pies for dessert, prepared by her bachelor uncle in the 
flats of Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For Phillip and Tania Jabour, 6 and 9: grape leaves and mahshi, which is squash 
and zucchini stuffed with rice, cooked by their Palestinian grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
For Eric Webb, 2, the best Christmas fare was the colorful plastic French fries 
and hamburger that came with a 3-foot-tall reproduction of a McDonald's 
restaurant, one of the morning's gifts. On a South-Central Los Angeles stoop, 
Eric's uncle, Robert Anderson, tried to assemble the counter while his mother, 
Sharon Anderson, warned that the treats were artificial. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not real," she said. Eric didn't care. He just kept gnawing away at 
the parts while his uncle stared dolefully at the instructions. 
</P>
<P>
The holiday celebration came Monday night at the Torres home in Santa Ana, so 
Tuesday it was back to work for 13-year-old Maribel. 
</P>
<P>
From 9 a.m. until dusk, she manned her station on a corner of Harbor Boulevard 
in Costa Mesa south of the San Diego Freeway, selling bunches of roses from a 
white bucket. 
</P>
<P>
Business was good as scores of people made a quick stop for flowers on the way 
to Christmas dinner. By late afternoon, the eighth-grader at Lathrop Junior 
High School had sold $300 worth of flowers, six times what she says she usually 
gets on her weekend and holiday shifts. 
</P>
<P>
The extra cash from commissions will pay for new clothes she's had her eye on, 
Maribel said. As for Christmas? "It's just another day," she said flatly. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a happy day because we're going over to my cousin Bernice's house, 
because you get presents and stuff, and because you get to see your relatives 
and people you have never seen before," said Richard Johnson, 10, of 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan Chaidez is a practical 8-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
He was happy to get a Game Boy, a miniature video game. "This is for when 
you're bored when your mom's at the mall," said Jordan, who lives in Ontario 
and was visiting his father in Monterey Park. "You can take it out and play 
with it for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
He was thrilled by his new shoes. "These are special skateboarding shoes," he 
explained. "And I begged for them for two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
"And you cried, too," said his dad, Jimmie. 
</P>
<P>
"Yeah," said Jordan. "I cried, too." 
</P>
<P>
For young girls at a group home near USC for abused and emotionally disturbed 
children, Christmas was a time of loss with subtle undertones of hope. 
</P>
<P>
A Sunday night blaze in the office of the Youth Growth and Development home had 
destroyed the youngsters' presents. Moreover, most of the children, who live at 
the state-funded facility because of problems at home, would not be seeing 
their families on the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me sad," said Antonia Gonzalez, 14, a tear in her left eye. "I'm 
hoping to see my mother and my two brothers again sometime in the future." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the six girls at the Dalton Avenue home were looking forward to a 
holiday dinner with other boys and girls who live in nearby group homes. 
</P>
<P>
They were also somewhat buoyed by last-minute replacement gifts that began 
arriving on Christmas Eve from Good Samaritans who had heard about the fire on 
TV news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
"It might just turn out OK," said Casonna White, 15. "We're going to get gifts, 
although it's not going to be the same." 
</P>
<P>
"Christmas is a time of giving and receiving, sharing and love. This fire was 
started by someone jealous because she wasn't going to have a good Christmas, I 
think." 
</P>
<P>
At a leafy intersection in San Marino, 4-year-old Kaitlin Lester and her 
3-year-old cousin, Cody Mitchell, were out for a morning stroll. Cody's father, 
Randy, was carrying another child, his 2-year-old daughter Amanda. 
</P>
<P>
Kaitlin, in white long-sleeved turtleneck and green corduroy overalls, was 
happily discussing her presents -- "two Bubba foowawas" (translation: "two 
Barbie Ferraris") -- when Cody started pushing her. 
</P>
<P>
"Cody, don't push me," Kaitlin said. "I don't want to get my clothes dirty." 
</P>
<P>
Cody laughed and gave her a good shove with both hands, sending her sprawling 
onto a nearby lawn. 
</P>
<P>
Kaitlin got herself up and punched Cody in the eye. 
</P>
<P>
"I got Reeboks and a phone -- because of Jesus' birthday," said Jason Harb, 14, 
of El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Jon Christopher Robnett, 4, happily tested his new Batman crossbow from the 
front porch of his grandparents' house in View Park. He used the gleaming 
black-and-tan device to send little plastic discs spinning onto the lawn. 
</P>
<P>
He was visiting along with his parents, his sister El-Lenor, 7, and brothers 
Julius, 3, and Justin, 14 months. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't long, though, before Jon Christopher could be heard asking, "Dad?" 
</P>
<P>
Will you find that Batman thing for me?" 
</P>
<P>
"Where did you shoot it? I don't know what you did with it," said his father, 
Chris. His mother, Debra, sighed.

<TEXT>
<P>
When Gloria Pineida and her two sons went for a walk to the store on Christmas 
morning, they didn't expect to find themselves sitting at a table inside 
Festival Hall in downtown Santa Ana, enjoying a turkey dinner with all the 
trimmings. 
</P>
<P>
But that's what happened when the family stumbled upon a free Christmas dinner 
for more than 2,000 low-income or homeless people, sponsored by employees of 
the Santa Ana Unified School District and a host of other charitable 
organizations. The free meal was one of several held throughout the county 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We were passing by and we saw that there was a dinner. It was a nice 
surprise," said Pineida, 36, who works as a maid at a hotel and lives with her 
sons in a one-bedroom apartment in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
For Pineida's 13-year-old son, Miguel, the party not only meant dinner, it 
meant presents. The Carr Intermediate School eighth-grader's face beamed as he 
was handed a brand-new basketball by a volunteer just after finishing his meal. 
</P>
<P>
The event was the brainchild of Willard Intermediate School Principal Howard 
Haas and McFadden Intermediate School Principal Al Aitcheson, who felt there 
wasn't enough being done for the less-fortunate on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there were more poor people than we realized," said Haas, who 
monitored the line that began forming around the building at 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Ricardo Chavarria, 21, brought several of his cousins to the meal. He shares a 
one-bedroom house in Santa Ana with 13 relatives, and the brand-new toys handed 
out at the party were their only gifts this year. 
</P>
<P>
"This party is very beautiful," Chavarria said in Spanish. "It's the first time 
the children get a gift, and they have food and everybody gets to be together." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to hungry families, the dinner also drew more than 350 volunteers 
who served food and drinks, handed out presents or acted as waiters. 
</P>
<P>
Among the volunteers were Tustin residents Rod and Pamela Propst and their 
children, Ryan, 11, and Rosanne, 7. The family spent the afternoon serving food 
and drinks after attending morning Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"We're trying to show the children that the true meaning of Christmas is 
helping other people," Pamela Propst said. "This is a good experience for 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Haas said the number of volunteers was "amazing." 
</P>
<P>
"We had people come out of the woodwork to help," he said. "We had many more 
people than we needed, which goes to show you that miracles really do happen." 
</P>
<P>
By 2:30 p.m., organizers were in danger of running out of food. The slices of 
bread once being served with meals had been replaced by corn tortillas and the 
last of 94 turkeys was being sliced. 
</P>
<P>
"It surprised us that there were so many people, so many families who needed 
the help this Christmas," said Ricardo Pena, director of Pena Referral Center, 
one of the event's co-sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of food in Westminster, where a free meal at Bob's Burgers on 
Beach Boulevard had only drawn about 40 people before noon. But organizer Judy 
Young of Orange County Christian Businesses and Associates said her 
organization was expecting to feed at least 1,000 people before the day was 
over. 
</P>
<P>
Seal Beach resident Doris Lowrie, 78, was one of the first to show up at Bob's 
Burgers for the meal, which consisted of ham, mashed potatoes, carrots, rolls 
and pie. Lowrie and her neighbor, John Denton, 73, found out about the free 
meal from a friend. 
</P>
<P>
"It's nice to be able to get out of the house when you're alone," Lowrie said. 
"I don't have any family -- I've outlived them all. So, it's just a real 
delight to be here and to meet all these nice people." 
</P>
<P>
Leon Germaine, a 40-year-old homeless man, said he came to Bob's Burgers 
because "I had nowhere else to go." 
</P>
<P>
Germaine said he has been living in the streets of Orange County for 23 years 
and has rarely been able to enjoy a hot holiday meal. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time I've ever come to anything like this, and I think it's 
great," he said. "I think it's great that they're doing this, but we need more 
help at other times during the year." 
</P>
<P>
In Garden Grove, more than 400 people showed up for a free holiday meal served 
at Garden Grove United Methodist Church. The meal, which consisted of ham and 
turkey with all the trimmings, was sponsored by Real Help, a Garden Grove-based 
charitable organization that feeds the hungry five times a week. 
</P>
<P>
The event drew many of the organization's regular clientele. But some people, 
like 30-year-old Tim Housley, took the bus down to the church because he said 
the lines at some of the Santa Ana dinners were too long. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Christmas dinner can get much better than this," Housley said 
between forkfuls of turkey and mashed potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
Jill Mullis, 35, sipped on hot coffee as her two sons, D.J., 7, and Jessy, 4, 
ate the last bites of their turkey and stuffing. 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas has been a special one for the Anaheim family because it finally 
has a place to call home. After five years of living in motel rooms, they were 
able to move into their first one-bedroom apartment three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
"It took every penny I have just to get us into that apartment, so something 
like this meal is so fantastic," said Mullis, who is a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
"This really makes a difference around the holidays for people who are on a 
fixed income," Mullis said. "We wouldn't be able to have any kind of special 
meal if we hadn't come here today."

DANA PARSONS: EX-ADDICT'S HAPPY ABOUT A CHRISTMAS WITHOUT SNOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS

<TEXT>
<P>
Connie would like to tell you about last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
She'd like to, but she can't remember much of it. 
</P>
<P>
Christmas '89 was a White Christmas for her, but not the kind Bing Crosby 
dreamed about. No, it was a White Christmas as in a Cocaine Christmas, and it 
left Connie in such a merry state that she figures it would have killed her had 
it continued much longer. 
</P>
<P>
But this isn't a Christmas downer story. It's a story about one woman's 
redemption of her own sins and the rescue of her own life. 
</P>
<P>
We're talking on Christmas Eve in the kitchen of a home in Santa Ana used as a 
shelter for homeless women -- a far cry from the comfort that Connie knew as a 
child in Southern California. At 13, she went to work with her mother and was 
making such good wages working as a medical transcriber that she foresaw a 
career in the field. The only dabbling she did with drugs as a teen-ager had 
left her uninterested. 
</P>
<P>
But at 20, she moved out of her parents' house and lived with a boyfriend. She 
got pregnant and at 21 became the mother of twin boys born two months early. It 
was a difficult pregnancy, and she wasn't ready to be the mother of twins. 
After an argument one night, she said, her boyfriend went out to buy some 
marijuana but came back instead with cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
She had never tried it but didn't think it could hurt her. "The first time I 
used it, I didn't think about it. I said, 'I'll use it tonight and that'll be 
it' because when I had experimented before, it didn't do what it was supposed 
to do. So I thought I could take it or leave it. But the coke really did what 
it was supposed to do. I thought, 'This stuff is great' because all of a sudden 
you don't have any problems. So we just kept using it." 
</P>
<P>
That was in April of 1989, when her twins were 2 months old. Through the rest 
of 1989, she and the twins' father continued using cocaine occasionally. She 
qualified for welfare and began using the money to buy coke, making sure only 
that the babies had clean diapers and formula. 
</P>
<P>
By Christmas of last year, Connie and her boyfriend were ready for the toot of 
their lives. "We had gotten kicked out of our apartment in July and ended up in 
this motel (in Anaheim). We had been there since August and it was almost as 
bad as living on the street. . . . That's when drugs became so easily 
accessible to us. We had them seven days a week, 24 hours a day, whenever we 
wanted them. We started a Christmas party on Dec. 1, because his dealer had 
just gotten out of jail, and we didn't stop until Jan. 5." 
</P>
<P>
Her recollections of last Christmas are a prolonged foggy reel. "I don't 
remember anything except that I was high. The family got presents for the kids, 
because we couldn't afford presents, because we had to buy drugs. We must have 
had 200 to 300 people in and out of the motel room that month. They'd come and 
buy drugs and sit around with us and get high with us." 
</P>
<P>
And the twins, then 10 months old? "I remember them being as high as us. I 
don't remember them sleeping a whole lot. They didn't want to eat, they didn't 
sleep. We were smoking the coke, so there was all this smoke and they (the 
babies) were getting it too." 
</P>
<P>
In May of this year, the system caught up with Connie and her boyfriend. Social 
workers placed the twins in the Orangewood Children's Home and ordered Connie 
to enroll in a drug recovery program. She had two relapses until the time in 
late September when she separated from the babies' father. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, she said, she has sworn off drugs. The shelter is run by the 
Shelter for the Homeless, a Westminster agency. Connie is working as a clerk 
for the county and is enrolled in a drug recovery program. She hopes to reclaim 
her children by spring, after proving she is drug-free and able to provide for 
them on her own. 
</P>
<P>
Of her drug ride, Connie, now 23, says: "I wonder why I did it. I really don't 
know why. Knowing how I felt about drugs before I started using, it's 
unbelievable I was as bad as I was. It makes me sick to think how I was, all 
the things I did." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't lost on her that, with her children already taken from her, she also 
was close to homelessness. "There were many times when I thought I was going to 
die when I was doing drugs. In fact, there were many times when I wanted to 
die, because I didn't feel I could give them (the drugs) up and I wanted to 
die, literally. I always knew it was wrong. I never lost touch with the fact 
that one of these days it was going to make me lose my kids, that it was going 
to kill me. I never rationalized. I always knew it was wrong, but I couldn't 
stop. I had a very serious addiction." 
</P>
<P>
This Christmas morning, Connie picked up her twin boys at Orangewood and took 
them to her parents' home, where she spent the kind of Christmas she remembers 
as a child. She is reconciled with her family, with whom contact had ended 
during her drug-use days. 
</P>
<P>
One of the relatives, she told me on Christmas Eve, planned to bring a video 
camera to record the day. 
</P>
<P>
Not that Connie needed one. 
</P>
<P>
This is one Christmas she's seeing for herself.

<P>
DAY CARE PLANNED FOR SICK CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM TORTOLANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Working parents faced with the dilemma of going to their jobs or staying home 
to care for mildly ill children may soon have a third alternative -- a day-care 
center for sick kids. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to parents who often have no choice but to lose a day's pay while 
caring for their children, Soroptimists International of Garden Grove is 
attempting to raise money to establish Lollipop Lodge, a nonprofit day-care 
center for for mildly ill children ages 6 weeks to 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
If the fund-raising drive goes as planned, the center will open in March, said 
Susan Ann Barry, a Garden Grove attorney and a spokesperson for the project. 
</P>
<P>
The tentative plan calls for the center to operate from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and 
care for 12 children daily. 
</P>
<P>
Barry said the idea for the center was suggested by Soroptimist members Pat 
Halberstadt, who is also executive director of the Garden Grove Girls Club, and 
Lillian Nizinski. 
</P>
<P>
"Both (Halberstadt and Nizinski) had encounters with parents who were told by 
doctors that their child had to stay home for the day, but who had to go to 
work," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
She said project organizers are negotiating for the lease of a suite of offices 
near Garden Grove Medical Center, which has agreed to donate $18,400 for the 
initial rent and the cost of a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
The Soroptimists are seeking contributions toward the center's projected annual 
budget of $82,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost to parents will be $25 a day, but there will also be a sliding scale 
based on ability to pay," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
She added that the plan calls for hiring a full-time director -- possibly a 
licensed vocational nurse -- and two part-time aides. A nurse will be on the 
premises, and a pediatrician will be on call, Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Plans also call for Lollipop Lodge to have an activity room, a library, an 
infant room, a resting room and a small sun porch. 
</P>
<P>
"We're also accepting new toys, books, things that kids can use," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
Those interested in making donations or otherwise helping out can call Barry at 
(714) 530-6111, or write the Soroptimists at P.O. Box 5282, Garden Grove, 
Calif. 92642. JIM TORTOLANO

</P>
<P>
Recently elected Councilwoman Sharon Cody will sit on the board of the San 
Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency. 
</P>

PARENTS CARING FOR CHILD GIVEN RESPITE

<P>
For more than two years, Maria Fuerte has been as much an intensive-care nurse 
as mother to her son Gonzalo Jr., who was born with hydrocephalus, a swelling 
of the brain caused by fluid buildup. 
</P>
<P>
Three times she has brought him back to life using cardiopulmonary 
resuscitation when the heart machine the youngster was attached to sounded a 
warning that his breathing had stopped. 
</P>
<P>
And in between emergencies, Fuerte tends to his everyday needs. 
</P>
<P>
But last weekend, Fuerte and her husband got a break from the pressures of 
caring for Gonzalo Jr., as they become the first couple to take advantage of a 
local United Cerebral Palsy program which gave them a weekend in a hotel suite 
donated by the Newport Beach Marriott Suites hotel. 
</P>
<P>
Hotel officials set them up in a suite overlooking the Back Bay and treated 
them to breakfast. Workers at the Cerebral Palsy office in Santa Ana set up an 
agenda that included an evening at a local comedy nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first vacation since Gonzalo was born," Fuerte said. Relatives, 
she said, would take care of her children, including Gonzalo Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Cerebral Palsy officials say the Fuertes aren't the only family that needs a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
About 700,000 people under the age of 21 have some form of cerebral palsy and 
more than 5,000 babies are born with the condition every year, said Alma Mesa, 
infant program coordinator for the group's Santa Ana office. 
</P>
<P>
"There are so many parents that have children with full-time needs and their 
stress levels are so high," Mesa said. "The need for this program is very 
real." 
</P>
<P>
Tailored after a national United Cerebral Palsy program called "Respitality," 
which serves 5,000 couples each year, the Orange County office has arranged 
with the Newport Marriott to provide rooms for two families a month for the 
next 13 months. 
</P>
<P>
Parents of any child suffering from a disease that requires full-time care are 
eligible, Mesa said. 
</P>
<P>
Cerebral Palsy officials in Washington say it can cost from $3 million to $12 
million over a lifetime to treat a person with cerebral palsy. 
</P>
<P>
But Fuerte said that since Gonzalo Jr. was born, time with her husband has been 
more precious than money. 
</P>
<P>
"This weekend will be the best Christmas present I could ever have," she said. 
"The best present we could give each other is our time together." FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE;

<P>
REDEVELOPMENT WAS LIMITED TO PIER IN '90 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Redevelopment in this seaside city over the last year was limited to repairing 
the city pier after plans for a project to restore a historic home fell 
through, according to a recent city report. 
</P>
<P>
The city's relatively small redevelopment area includes the bluff-top Casa 
Romantica, built as a private residence for San Clemente's founder in the 
mid-1920s, and the area just below it, known as the Pier Bowl. This includes 
the parking area and residential streets surrounding the municipal pier on 
Avenida Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
Although lofty plans to upgrade both areas were expected to be in place by now, 
the city was forced to put them on hold when Ratkovich Co., a Los Angeles-based 
developer selected to restore Casa Romantica, dropped out of the project after 
its reconstruction plans drew public opposition. The city purchased the home in 
1989 for $2 million with the intent of preserving it as a landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Delaying the plans for Casa Romantica also delayed a Pier Bowl Master Plan that 
proposes to redesign city parking areas and provide more commercial 
opportunities near the pier. Also on hold are plans to expand the Fisherman's 
Restaurant at the base of the pier. 
</P>
<P>
Previously discussed plans for the Pier Bowl included a small hotel and a 
restaurant on the hillside just below Casa Romantica, as well as a multilevel 
parking structure. But a public outcry against such drastic changes forced city 
officials to scale back the plans. 
</P>
<P>
Redevelopment agency profits of $915,000 from the 1989-90 fiscal year are 
projected to increase by only $100,000 in fiscal year 1990-91, because the city 
does not plan on acquiring more property, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"Based on the revenue picture for next year, most of the (profits) will be from 
tax-increment funding," said Assistant Financial Director Mike White. 
</P>
<P>
Required property taxes in the redevelopment area are frozen at 1975 levels, 
when the redevelopment agency was founded, White explained. The city profits 
from the difference between 1975 and current-year property values for the land, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency also sets aside 20% of its funds to assist with home improvements 
for low-income families, White said. The agency so far has collected about 
$640,000 for this purpose, according to the report. WENDY PAULSON

<P>
City planners recently approved a $2-million proposal for improving the 
Interstate 5 interchange at Camino de Estrella. 
</P>
<P>
Heavy traffic congestion along San Clemente's northernmost thoroughfare, which 
is known as Camino de los Mares east of the freeway, has forced traffic 
engineers to propose widening the road by 100 feet and installing eight new, 
synchronized traffic signals. 
</P>
<P>
Also being proposed is the widening of the southbound freeway off-ramp to 
Camino de Estrella in order to provide a left-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
If the project is approved by the City Council, the changes are expected to be 
under way by spring 1991, according to traffic engineer Akram Hindeyeh. WENDY

BUSINESS AS USUAL ON CHRISTMAS; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: HAVING TO WORK HAS BECOME AN ACCEPTED ROUTINE FOR MANY, SOME OF WHOM 
CELEBRATE A DAY EARLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Asphalt was visible in the shopping mall parking lots for the first time in 
days Tuesday and the freeways looked almost as deserted, signs that most 
businesses were closed for Christmas and that most workers had the day off. 
</P>
<P>
But for Newport Beach lifeguard Brian O'Rourke and other public safety and 
service workers in Orange County, Christmas was just another day on the job. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not even like it's Christmas today," said O'Rourke, 23, while watching 
beachcombers enjoy the sun from the lifeguard headquarters at the base of the 
Newport Pier. "It's just another day at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke said he volunteered to work on Christmas because he isn't married. He 
said he was planning to celebrate the holiday after work with his family. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't really mind working Christmas," he said. "It's slow. It's been like 
that all week. And because everything's closed, you can't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
Fellow lifeguard Lt. Craig Farmer, 35, said he, too, volunteered to take the 
Christmas Day shift because "I don't have kids. Christmas is meant for families 
and kids opening their presents." 
</P>
<P>
Business was also slow at the Orange County coroner's office, which operates at 
full staff on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"It's just like any other day for us," said Kurt Murine, 30, a technician at 
the Orange County coroner's office, just before taking X-rays of the body of a 
drive-by shooting victim from Santa Ana. "We start at the same time and end at 
the same time." 
</P>
<P>
Working Christmas isn't as painful as it could be, Murine said, because his 
family has traditionally celebrated the holiday on Christmas Eve. Of course, 
since he worked Monday as well, long visits with his and his wife's family 
Monday night allowed him only a few hours of sleep before he had to be back at 
work at 7 a.m. Christmas Day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Working on Christmas has become routine for some in the coroner's office 
because of the nature of the business. 
</P>

"I've been married for 25 years and I've only had five Christmases off with my 
family," said technician Alonzo Leckie, 52. "We work 365 days a year here and 
something's going on all the time." 
</P>
<P>
To accommodate working on Christmas, Leckie and his family also celebrated on 
Christmas Eve, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a way of life, especially if you've been in this business for a while," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bill King, supervising deputy coroner and the day watch commander, said those 
working Tuesday simply had the misfortune of having their regular shift fall on 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a regular day -- they couldn't squeeze out of it," King joked. 
</P>
<P>
"Working Christmas is an inconvenience," he said, "but if it wasn't an 
inconvenience to me it would be an inconvenience for somebody else." 
</P>
<P>
Not all Christmas Day workers were in the public-safety business, of course. 
</P>
<P>
John Campos, manager of the Wherehouse store on Harbor Boulevard in Costa Mesa, 
said working on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day stalled his regular holiday 
visit to his parents' home in the San Francisco Bay Area. The store closed at 9 
p.m. Christmas Day, two hours earlier than normal, but business was steady all 
day. 
</P>
<P>
Business also was brisk at a Fountain Valley 7-Eleven, said George Relation, 
42, who worked behind the counter all day Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Relation said volunteering to work on Christmas Day allowed him to do a favor 
for other store workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Working allows the ones that have families to stay home and celebrate."

3 ROOF BLAZES BLAMED ON HOME FIREPLACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Three Christmas Day fires -- including one started by burning gift boxes and 
wrapping -- caused substantial damage to two homes and minor damage to another, 
Orange County fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The blazes, in Placentia, Yorba Linda and Villa Park, all started on the roofs 
of the houses, said Orange County Fire Department Capt. Dan Young. In one of 
the fires, a homeowner was unaware that his roof was on fire until a neighbor 
pounded on his door to warn him. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the homeowner, identified as Richard McMillan, 43, of Potomac 
Avenue, Placentia, was "up with his kids, who were playing with their toys, and 
smelled smoke" shortly after 9 a.m., but was unable to determine the source. 
</P>
<P>
"About 10 minutes later, (a neighbor) came over and pounded on the door, saying 
that the roof was on fire," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, caused by burning embers from the fireplace, was brought under 
control in 30 minutes and caused $140,000 in damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the Yorba Linda fire, a couple was in their Casa Loma Avenue home when they 
smelled smoke and discovered that their roof was engulfed by flames. They 
called 911 at 11:40 a.m. to report the fire at their converted farmhouse, Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Young said investigators determined that cracks in the chimney's mortar allowed 
heat to escape into the attic and set combustible materials ablaze. Fire damage 
was set at $80,000. 
</P>
<P>
In the third blaze, investigators determined that burning wrapping paper was 
the cause of a Villa Park fire on Dorothy Circle. 
</P>
<P>
Young said the homeowner was in his home with eight other people when his 
fireplace "went out of control." 
</P>
<P>
"He was burning some Christmas wrappings and boxes, which we specifically (tell 
residents) 'don't do,' " Young said. "Sections of boxes and paper blew right up 
through the chimney and landed on the roof, which caught fire." 
</P>
<P>
King and his other guests battled the blaze with garden hoses and kept damage 
to a minimum.

A man was fatally shot on a street corner Tuesday in what police said was a 
drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Jorge Espinoza, 26, of Santa Ana was shot once in the chest about 10:40 a.m. 
near an apartment complex at Bristol and Walnut streets. He staggered around 
the corner before collapsing behind a bus-stop bench outside 124 S. Bristol 
St., Police Sgt. Dan Beaumarchais said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was definitely a drive-by (shooting)," Beaumarchais said. "If it's not 
gang-related, it's dope-related." 
</P>
<P>
The victim was pronounced dead at the scene. There were no arrests.

MIKE PENNER: THE DODGERS ARE ON FIRE, BUT ANGELS KEEP FIDDLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER

<TEXT>
<P>
Another Christmas has come and gone, and did you notice how the neighborhood 
baseball teams made out? 
</P>
<P>
Both teams got new right fielders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got Darryl Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got Dave Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams got new center fielders. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got Junior Felix. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams got some pitching help. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers got Bob Ojeda and Kevin Gross. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels got Floyd Bannister. 
</P>
<P>
Both teams also caught a glimpse of the future, as to how they'll be spending 
next year's holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
The Dodgers saw 25 golden rings, four World Series victories, three All-Stars 
in the outfield, 2.9 million in attendance and Lasorda on the TV screen all 
damn winter. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels saw 162 lumps of coal. 
</P>
<P>
It has to be rough sharing a hedge with the team that doesn't. The Dodgers just 
won't sit still. They don't make the World Series for a couple of seasons, and 
they get nervous. They've got places to call, turkey to talk, people to beat. 
</P>
<P>
The Angels, of course, haven't made a World Series since the dawn of man. Every 
so often, they get the misguided notion that they're close, like right after 
the 1989 season, when they won 91 games. Then they go out, get Mark Langston 
and Dave Winfield and finish the next season 23 games out, so you can 
understand why they're a little bit confused. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, this is the first winter in many winters the Angels have an actual 
game plan. The idea was to give Manager Doug Rader a stronger say in personnel 
matters, a slice of inspiration that, so far, has shown to carry a double edge. 
</P>
<P>
Rader favors a youth movement, or at least a new one, seeing as how the youth 
movement of '87 got old in a hurry. This is the right way to think. The Angels 
need to re-fortify their minor league system, add fuel to the fire started by 
Joe Grahe and Scott Lewis, and squandering first-round draft picks on 
designer-label free agents isn't going to get it done. Building from within and 
trading for prospects, at this point, is the safest and sanest approach. 
</P>
<P>
But Rader also favors surrounding himself with players he knows, which has 
meant turning the Angels into the Chicago White Sox Alumni Assn. Rader no doubt 
has fond memories of his years with the White Sox -- as a coach for Tony 
LaRussa, he salvaged his career out of the Texas Ranger dumpster -- and now, 
Anaheim Stadium is crawling with old White Sox: Bannister, Gallagher, Fred 
Manrique, Donnie Hill. 
</P>
<P>
One problem: The old White Sox were no good. 
</P>
<P>
Even the new White Sox recognize this, which is why Ron Schueler's front office 
has become the Emery of the American League West. Out go Eric King, Shawn 
Hillegas, Ivan Calderon, Barry Jones. In come Tim Raines, Cory Snyder, Charlie 
Hough. 
</P>
<P>
This represents slippage as far as the Angels are concerned. The Angels 
finished fourth in the AL West in 1990, behind Oakland, Chicago and Texas. 
Oakland and Texas have basically stood pat; the A's lost Willie McGee, but he 
was only a temp until Dave Henderson healed, and re-signing Bob Welch was 
addition by anti-attrition. The White Sox, though, have clearly picked up the 
pace, enlisting help where they needed it most -- on offense, in the outfield 
-- and outlegging the Angels to the finish line for Raines. 
</P>
<P>
Consider that the Angels and the White Sox set out this winter on one similar 
mission -- Needed: One Center Fielder -- and compare how they completed the 
route. Better yet, go back in time, to 1988 or so, and compare these potential 
trade packages: 
</P>
<P>
Devon White and Willie Fraser. 
</P>
<P>
Ivan Calderon and Barry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
Which one brings home Raines and which one buys you Junior Felix? 
</P>
<P>
Now, 1991 is knocking, and for the Angels, the pressure mounts. Team Anaheim is 
coming off a dismal summer, which was bad enough, but all winter long, Team 
Chavez Ravine has been cleaning its clock. Do the Angels stay the course, stay 
with what's at home and take a couple years off to rebuild? Or do they yield to 
temptation and shoot for the marquee moon, throwing themselves at the first big 
name that winks in their direction? 
</P>
<P>
Those Wally Joyner-for-Lee Smith rumors scare me. 
</P>
<P>
All of this has jacked up the ante in the Gary Gaetti sweepstakes, almost to 
the point where the Angels can no longer afford to lose him. Flawed though he 
is -- 32 years old, coming off two sub-par seasons -- Gaetti fills Angel needs 
on two levels that cannot be ignored. Physically, it's a simple equation: The 
Angels are desperate for a third baseman, especially one that won't cost them a 
draft choice in return. But psychologically, Gaetti also lets the Angels feel 
better about themselves in the Strawberry-Butler market. See, the Angels can 
get their man, too. 
</P>
<P>
Gaetti would be a shot in the season-ticket brochure, would give the Angels a 
new-look infield that wouldn't look half-bad and, with a Bert Blyleven-type 
comeback, could even give the Angels a fighting chance in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Swing and miss on Gaetti, though, and things could get awfully grim again. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 baseball is still more than three months off, and already the Dodgers 
are dropping hints about Eric Davis, the L.A. native who becomes a free agent 
at the end of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, the Angels aren't even sure they can keep Chili Davis.

PERSIAN GULF CRISIS REKINDLES DEBATE OVER ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SOURCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
It is both a great success and a colossal failure. 
</P>
<P>
Rising like a mirage from the barren North Dakota prairie, the Great Plains 
Synfuels Plant is one of the most noteworthy remnants of the frantic era that 
followed the Arab oil embargo, when the United States spent millions of dollars 
to develop alternative energy sources. 
</P>
<P>
The Great Plains plant showed that the country could produce natural gas on a 
commercial scale from the West's vast supply of coal. But because of the 
unexpected plummeting of natural gas prices, the synthetic product could not be 
manufactured at a profit. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a technological success but a financial failure," said James Hartnett, 
director of the Energy Resources Center at the University of Illinois in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
The plant was almost shut down in 1985 after the consortium that built it 
defaulted on $1.5 billion in federal loans. It now makes money -- but only 
because its current owners bought it from the government at a fire sale price 
in 1988 and because buyers of its gas are bound by long-term contracts that set 
the price above market rates. 
</P>
<P>
After years of cheap fuel that made the costly search for alternative energy 
sources seem economically impractical, the crisis in the Middle East has once 
again focused attention on alternative fuels and sharpened the debate over 
national energy policy. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the roughly $2 billion spent so far on Great Plains and other 
alternative energy projects, the United States today is just as dependent on 
foreign oil as it ever was, energy experts say. 
</P>
<P>
In 1973, when the energy crunch began, the country imported 6 million barrels 
of oil per day, according to figures from the U.S. Energy Information Center. 
For a time, oil imports declined, but last year's averaged 7.2 million barrels 
per day. 
</P>
<P>
So far this year, oil imports average 7.6 million barrels per day. And imported 
oil once again accounts for more than half of the oil consumed in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
"We're right back in the same trap we were in 1973," Hartnett argues. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite, says Ralph Bayre, director of the Synthetic Fuels Project in the 
Treasury Department, which monitors projects begun under the now-defunct 
federal Synthetic Fuels Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Although acknowledging that relatively small amounts of energy are being 
produced from alternative energy sources, Bayre said Great Plains and a host of 
other projects begun in the early 1980s "were certainly a success to the extent 
to which we've developed a number of technologies that would be very useful if 
we needed them." 
</P>
<P>
The Synthetic Fuels Corp. was created in 1980 to find ways of developing 
cleaner fuels from coal and shale. It developed four alternative energy 
projects: coal gasification plants in California and Louisiana, a shale 
facility in Colorado and a heavy oil plant in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
Great Plains, by far the largest alternative energy project, was funded by the 
Energy Department before the Synthetic Fuels Corp. was created. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the large quantity of coal and shale in the Western states, Bayre said 
that because of the technology developed in the early 1980s, "we can start 
generating large quantities (of energy) very quickly if we need to." 
</P>
<P>
Still, critics of the synfuels programs, such as Hartnett, complain that the 
programs threw "billions of dollars around in three or four different 
directions (when) we didn't have the technology to accommodate that kind of 
money." 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Kent Janssen, chief operating officer of Dakota Gasification 
Co., which operates the synfuels plant, believe that the government has moved 
too slowly in developing synthetic fuels. 
</P>
<P>
Noting the long lead time required to build plants such as Great Plains, he 
said: "We can't wait until we actually need it" to start building new plants. 
"We have to get started on that path to get some part of our mix from coal. . . 
. The government needs to develop an energy policy." 
</P>
<P>
President Bush's top advisers held a vigorous debate Friday over the outlines 
of such a policy. Energy Secretary James D. Watkins reportedly favors tougher 
requirement for automotive fuel efficiency and greater use of non-gasoline 
fuels. But John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Michael Boskin, 
the President's chief economist, oppose those proposals as too costly. 
</P>
<P>
North Dakota Gov. George A. Sinner, chairman of the National Governors Assn.'s 
committee on energy and the environment, supports a combination of conservation 
and increased reliance on alternative energy sources. Sinner argues, too, that 
the government should impose a floor price on the cost of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
Companies are reluctant to drill for new energy, he says -- just as they fear 
investing heavily in alternative fuels -- because of concern that plummeting 
oil prices will once again make such ventures uneconomical. Establishing a 
floor, Sinner argues, would remove that fear and force Americans to cut 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
Hartnett agrees that fuel prices should rise. High gasoline taxes, he said, 
should be used to build up the nation's public transportation systems. Gasoline 
costs $3 to $4 a gallon in much of Europe, Hartnett noted. If prices began to 
rise here, he said, "you would begin to see people exercise a little more 
caution in how they use gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
However, Hartnett acknowledged, there is little political support for such a 
move. Special programs -- such as a "fuel stamp" system akin to food stamps -- 
would have to be devised to help those who couldn't afford the high prices, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the Great Plains plant's rocky past, Janssen predicts that by the time 
the company's long-term contracts with buyers expire in 2009, the price of 
natural gas will be high enough that Great Plains' synthetic product can be 
sold at a profit. "We think there will be customers out there to buy our gas," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
When the plant opened in 1984, it cost $6.75 to produce 1,000 cubic feet of 
gas, Janssen said. The market rate was about $5. 
</P>
<P>
Now, because of more efficient operations and because of the money the company 
makes from selling byproducts of the gas-conversion process -- such as 
anhydrous ammonia, sulfur and liquid nitrogen -- the average cost of production 
is $2.75. 
</P>
<P>
But the market price is about $1.90. 
</P>
<P>
Because the plant emits more sulfur dioxide into the air than is permissible 
under state standards, the company expects to spend more than $100 million 
adding scrubbers and other pollution-cutting equipment. That will drive the 
cost of production higher -- but not enough to threaten the plant's future 
profitability, Janssen said. 
</P>
<P>
The 600-acre plant produces 148 million cubic feet of gas per day, enough to 
heat 3,000 homes. 
</P>
<P>
In the gasification process, lignite coal is mixed with oxygen and steam, and 
subjected to intense heat to break down its components. The resultant hydrogen 
and carbon are then reassembled as methane. 
</P>
<P>
"As long as the market price is below production costs, the plant is somewhat 
at risk," acknowledged Robert L. McPhail, general manager of Basin Electric 
Power Cooperative, Dakota Gasification's parent company. Still, he says of 
Great Plains: "This is the biggest success story out of all the millions the 
government spent on alternative fuels." 
</P>
<P>
It didn't seem that way in 1984 when the plant opened. It was already a white 
elephant. The price of natural gas had plummetted. The consortium that built 
the plant was losing money. 
</P>
<P>
When the Energy Department refused to provide more financial assistance, the 
partners defaulted on $1.5 billion in government loans and walked away. Basin 
Electric purchased the plant in 1988 for $85 million. The low purchase price is 
a major factor in its current profitability. 
</P>
<P>
Under the sale agreement, the government gets to share in the company's revenue 
when it makes a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the company made its first payment -- $11.1 million -- from 
its 1989 profits.

<P>
Jeanne Warren Lindsay's first contact with pregnant teen-agers came in 1972 as 
she was working as a long-term substitute English teacher at a continuation 
high school in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
A few of the students she saw were pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
"These young women were so hungry for information," Lindsay recalled. "I 
offered them a child-development text for English credit. It was the usual 
textbook for students who won't be parents for 10 years, and there was 
certainly no mention of single parents. But they wanted information so badly on 
rearing their children they were willing to read it." 
</P>
<P>
When Lindsay was hired later that year to start a special school program for 
pregnant and parent teen-agers in the ABC Unified School District in Cerritos, 
she saw just how inadequately textbooks dealt with teen-age mothers and their 
special needs. 
</P>
<P>
"The materials you could get, the textbooks, didn't appear to know that people 
got pregnant in their teens, and yet at that time one out of five babies in the 
country were born to teen-agers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Lindsay set out to help fill the information gap. 
</P>
<P>
Borrowing $2,000 from a relative, she founded Morning Glory Press, an 
independent small publishing company that specializes in books for pregnant and 
parent teens. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Morning Glory Press has published 11 books, all either written or 
co-written by Lindsay. It also distributes nine titles from other publishers. 
</P>
<P>
Although other publishing houses offer single titles on the subject, Lindsay 
says, Morning Glory is the only press specializing in books solely for these 
teen-agers. This year, she says, Morning Glory will gross more than $300,000, 
with the majority of its sales to schools, social service agencies and 
libraries around the country. 
</P>
<P>
The venture was originally run out of a spare bedroom in the Buena Park tract 
house she shares with Bob, her husband of 39 years. One by one, as each of 
their five children moved out, Lindsay would take over the abandoned bedroom 
for office and book-storage space. Now, Morning Glory Press has its 
headquarters in a spacious office built five years ago behind their garage. A 
modest sign on the front of the garage -- itself piled high with boxed books 
ready for shipping -- points the way to the seat of Lindsay's mini publishing 
empire. 
</P>
<P>
The 768-square-foot office has a vaulted ceiling and large windows overlooking 
the back yard. At one end is a kitchenette. An old library ladder leads to a 
loft, where Lindsay does most of her writing, in shorthand, while reclining on 
a chaise longue. If it's sunny, she writes on the chaise longue in the back 
yard. 
</P>
<P>
At the other end of the office, separated by a fireplace and sitting area, is 
the business part of the room, with its two computers, two printers, a 
typewriter, four filing cabinets and shelves crammed with books. 
</P>
<P>
It's a homey atmosphere, with lots of knickknacks, pictures and a poster 
quoting newspaperman A.J. Liebling: "Freedom of the press belongs to those who 
own one." 
</P>
<P>
It's here where Lindsay, usually clad in a sweat shirt, typically puts in a 
60-hour workweek. 
</P>
<P>
Morning Glory Press is not, however, a one-person operation. 
</P>
<P>
Along with two part-time workers who box books and fill out invoices in an 
adjoining room, there's Carole Blum, who went to work for Lindsay five years 
ago. Blum's title, Lindsay joked one morning recently, depends "on what letters 
she's writing: She's sales manager, director of promotions, office manager and 
customer service."

"Well," Blum said looking up from her computer, "at a small place, you have to 
do what has to be done." 
</P>

Lindsay continued to teach and coordinate the teen mother program at Tracy High 
School in Cerritos as Morning Glory Press grew. But she took an early 
retirement in 1988: "I love teaching, but I couldn't do both. I was going 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
At 61, Lindsay says she figures "I'm about 10 to 15 years away from retirement. 
I've got a lot to do." 
</P>
<P>
Among the more recent Morning Glory books are "School-Age Parents: The 
Challenge of Three-Generation Living," which was published several months ago 
and is intended for "families facing the dilemma of adolescent pregnancy and 
parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
This month, the press published the revised edition of Lindsay's 1982 book, "Do 
I Have a Daddy: A Story About a Single-Parent Child." The slim volume offers an 
illustrated story for the child and a section in the back with suggestions for 
the single mother from other young mothers rearing children alone. Since it was 
first published eight years ago, "Do I Have a Daddy" has consistently sold 
about 100 copies a month. 
</P>
<P>
Morning Glory Press's biggest seller is the 1981 book "Teens Parenting: The 
Challenge of Babies and Toddlers," at 60,000 copies and sales remaining steady. 
This book, which is recommended by the American Library Assn., offers 
guidelines for parenting during the child's first two years and features 
extensive comments from young mothers interviewed by Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been the book that's kept us going," said Lindsay, who is currently 
revising "Teens Parenting." 
</P>
<P>
"My husband says, 'Don't fix it if it ain't broken,' but I'm not going to have 
a 10-year-old book out there." Bob Lindsay recently retired from Rockwell 
International and now serves as Morning Glory Press's vice president. Jokes 
Lindsay: "He prides himself in never packing a book or typing an invoice." 
</P>
<P>
In revising "Teens Parenting," Lindsay and two co-authors are expanding it into 
a three-book set: Separate books will deal with pregnancy and newborns, caring 
for a baby and toddler, and discipline from birth to age 3. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay spent October and most of December interviewing teen-age mothers and 
fathers for the revised edition, which she hopes to have in print in time for 
her exhibit next June at the annual American Booksellers Assn. convention in 
New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay says she believes that the reason her books sell so well is less a 
matter of her talent as a writer than it is the words of the dozens of young 
people she interviews for each book. 
</P>
<P>
By quoting extensively from her interviews, she said, "that means I don't have 
to preach. Kids are terribly sensitive to being preached at, and sometimes they 
need to face a little reality. If those realities are described by their peers, 
they're more likely to accept information." 
</P>
<P>
The interviews are her favorite part of the job: "All these moms share their 
very personal lives with me. That's awfully special. I owe so much to those 
kids. If they quit talking to me, that's where I'll be finished." 
</P>
<P>
After 13 years publishing, Morning Glory Press is just now beginning to branch 
out. 
</P>
<P>
Next spring will see its first book that Lindsay had no part in writing: 
"Surviving Teen Pregnancy: Your Choices, Dreams and Decisions" by Shirley 
Arthur, a former teen-age mother from Denver. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really excited about her book," Lindsay said. She also is about to sign a 
contract with another Colorado writer who shadowed a teen-age mother for a year 
and has written a book from the young mother's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
Like any publisher, Lindsay said, she receives a lot of manuscripts in the 
mail. Many of them are either not well-written or are inappropriate for Morning 
Glory Press. 
</P>
<P>
"One manuscript came in written like a romance novel," she said. "I didn't get 
past Page 5. We don't need romance novels. We need things that kids will think 
are real." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay does the typesetting for her books on her Macintosh computer and also 
designs most of the advertising layouts, writes the press releases and develops 
promotional campaigns for each book. Before a book goes to the printer, she 
said, "I get input from other people in the field, including teachers and 
occasionally students at school." 
</P>
<P>
Although she retired, Lindsay continues to serve as a part-time consultant for 
the teen mother programs at Tracy High and at Cabrillo Lane School in Lakewood. 
She spends half a day each week visiting new mothers in their homes a month 
before they return to school. 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay believes that keeping in touch with teen mothers is vital for someone 
who writes and publishes books about pregnant and parenting teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the only way I can know what a teen parent today is thinking and what 
her world is like because it's not the same now as it was 15 years ago," she 
said. "People stereotype teen parents an awful lot, and I'm awfully 
uncomfortable with the stereotypes." 
</P>
<P>
Lindsay also is active in the National Organization on Adolescent Pregnancy and 
Parenting. She recently resigned as the volunteer editor of the group's 
quarterly newsletter and has started publishing her own, PPT Express, for 
teachers and others working with pregnant and parenting teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
Two or three times a month she attends professional conferences around the 
country, at which she displays the Morning Glory Press line of books. She also 
receives frequent invitations to conduct workshops on pregnant and parenting 
teens and on adoption from the birth family's perspective, a topic she has 
written four books about. 
</P>
<P>
Like many women her age who had children in the '50s, Lindsay said, she 
believed that she had to stay home with the children when they were growing up. 
</P>
<P>
Although she did not go back to work until 1970, she did return to college in 
the late '60s to earn master's degrees in home economics and anthropology. "I 
think I kept my sanity by going to school. I like working an awful lot. If it 
had been another era, I don't think I would have stayed home that long." 
</P>
<P>
She stroked the Siamese cat curled up on the sofa next to her. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing I like so much about working is the freedom I feel. Really, nobody 
tells me what to do, and that's terribly important to me," she said, picking up 
the cat and noting that she had not yet been asked how Morning Glory Press got 
its name. 
</P>
<P>
"This is Morning Glory, and she's 18 now," she said. "When you have five kids, 
you don't name it after one of them. You name it after your cat."

FAIRVIEW REGIONAL PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By APRIL JACKSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fairview Regional Park's undeveloped, historic parkland is home to 
remote-control gliders, miniature train rides and a multipurpose trail. As a 
recreational area, the bluff-top park along the Santa Ana River in Costa Mesa 
is spacious and uncluttered, offering plenty of room to try out all the new 
toys received over the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
Listed in the National Registry of Historic Places, Fairview is thought to be 
one of the most valuable archeological sites in Orange County. Over the past 30 
years, archeologists have uncovered tools, house floors, hearths and cogged 
stones from the site that date back 3,000 years. (Cogged stones are associated 
with an Indian religious cult that flourished along the Santa Ana River.) 
</P>
<P>
"Fairview was developed as a 'passive' park, which means that the land is not 
developed for any one specific use," said Dave Alkema, superintendent of Costa 
Mesa's Parks and Recreation Department. "The first phase of the park, including 
some revegetation, is completed and we're reviewing the park's Master Plan to 
determine the priority needs of the community." 
</P>
<P>
Proposals requesting permission to install athletic fields will be raised at 
meetings after the first of the year. Representatives of youth soccer leagues, 
Little League and Pop Warner Football have all expressed a desire to develop a 
sports complex on the site. 
</P>
<P>
"We're in the throes of (deciding) what we want to do at Fairview Park," Alkema 
said. "At first, we ran into money problems, but this year we got a little 
funding from the state. As soon as the city decides the best use of the land, 
we'll get going on the Phase II." 
</P>
<P>
While it appears that the second phase will involve turning undeveloped land 
into grass-covered sports fields, one group will not be affected by the 
changing landscape. 
</P>
<P>
More interested in the air above the park rather than the ground, 
remote-control plane pilots flock to Fairview Park to loop-the-loop, lured by 
afternoon thermals blowing off the shoreline. The park site is quickly becoming 
one of the most frequented mini-airports for the county's avid model plane 
aviators. 
</P>
<P>
Another group dedicated to playing in the park is the Orange County Model 
Engineers. Located on the east side of Placentia Avenue, the nonprofit club is 
building the miniature Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction Railroad, named to 
honor historical monikers for Newport Beach and Costa Mesa. About 700 feet of 
temporary track have been laid to carry live steamers -- working scale models 
of full-sized steam locomotives. 
</P>
<P>
The club offers free rides to the public on every third full weekend of the 
month. Upon completion, the railroad will include 2,800 feet of track that will 
cross a 96-foot-long bridge. Members hope to have the project completed by 
February. 
</P>
<P>
"Within the next few years," said Ben Viola, a Midway City resident whose Santa 
Fe locomotive pulls about 90% of the passengers, "Fairview Park will have one 
of the finest sites in the county for live steamers." 
</P>
<P>
If new bicycles or running shoes are the toys of choice, a trail cuts through 
the raw parkland, crossing a man-made bridge and connecting with the Santa Ana 
River Trail two miles east of Huntington State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Fairview Regional Park offers adults and children alike ample space to frolic 
with Fido or to take a ride on the Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction 
Railroad. 
</P>
<P>
Hours: Park is open from sunrise to sunset. 
</P>
<P>
Address: 2500 block of Placentia Avenue 
</P>
<P>
Telephone: (714) 754-5300 
</P>
<P>
Miscellaneous information: Train rides are held on the third full weekend of 
each month from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. only. For more information on the Orange 
County Model Engineers, contact Ben Viola at (714) 894-4318. APRIL JACKSON

RELATIONSHIPS: NEW YEAR'S RESOLUTION SHOULD GET TO THE HEART OF THE MATTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERRY ANGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You refuse to drive anywhere on New Year's Eve and you're so burned out on 
holiday cheer by then that you'd rather not invite anyone to your place, so you 
are settling in for a quiet evening at home. 
</P>
<P>
If you're like many other New Year's Eve couch potatoes, you'll probably end up 
falling asleep in front of the tube long before the countdown in Times Square 
reaches your living room. You'll greet 1991 in the morning, just in time for 
the first kickoff. 
</P>
<P>
But you might want to consider planning a more stimulating celebration at home 
that will keep you awake long enough -- and put you in the right mood -- to 
collect a midnight kiss (or two . . . ) from your mate. You might try an 
elegant dinner with candles, champagne and, most important, intimate 
conversation that sets the tone for a promising New Year. 
</P>
<P>
This is the time to make some resolutions about how you and your partner can 
work together to improve your relationship with each other and your children -- 
and perhaps other family members -- in 1991. If your resolutions in the past 
have been mostly pragmatic -- things like getting your 20-year-old body back, 
bathing your dog more often or finishing your novel -- it may be difficult, at 
first, to come up with resolutions focusing on the deeper matter of making your 
loved ones happy. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, you are about to get some help from Orange County family 
therapists, who were asked to identify the New Year's resolutions they would 
most like to see couples make. Because therapists work mostly with families in 
distress, they relished the opportunity to suggest ways to enrich relationships 
that might help prevent crises. So here goes. 
</P>
<P>
Todd Creager, a Huntington Beach marriage, family and child counselor who 
specializes in couples therapy, stressed the importance of effective 
communication. He suggested that couples resolve to: "Be honest with each 
other. Stop holding back or hiding feelings. Remember you cannot not 
communicate. If you are not expressing yourself directly, you are doing it 
indirectly, and that is always worse. We often communicate unexpressed feelings 
by acting them out in such ways as withdrawing, starting arguments and being 
defiant." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to communicating more directly, couples should show respect for 
each other even when they are angry, negotiate in a way that allows both to 
feel that their opinions and desires matter, and put aside their own agendas so 
that they can really listen to each other, Creager added. 
</P>
<P>
He'd also like to see couples make a commitment to "focus on the best in each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
"People change behaviors much more quickly if given strokes for their 
constructive behaviors, even if those behaviors are few and far between," he 
explained. "Ongoing criticism about negative behaviors tends to preserve the 
status quo." 
</P>
<P>
Helen Greenblatt, a Laguna Hills psychotherapist, encourages people to "let go 
of old beliefs so they're free to seek new challenges" in their family 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
She explained: "We cling to the old patterns and habits because they're 
comfortable, but they're really not moving us forward." 
</P>
<P>
Those old beliefs may prevent people from finding peace in difficult 
relationships, she said. "We stereotype our family members, especially our 
parents. If we could just step back and look at them objectively without any of 
the guilt or shame or past hurts, we might see them in a way more acceptable to 
us. We should be charitable with our families and give them the benefit of the 
doubt." 
</P>
<P>
The tendency to resist change in a relationship often leads to major crises, 
said Gerry Owen of Owen Family Counseling in Brea. 
</P>
<P>
"The way we talk tends to focus on keeping things the same," he said. "If 
someone goes off in one direction, we try to pull them back toward the past." 
</P>
<P>
Couples can tell they're resisting change if they keep repeating a "stuck 
conversation" that always leaves them feeling bad but never gets resolved, Owen 
noted. 
</P>
<P>
If couples don't face changes in each other and their relationship as they 
occur, they may eventually be forced to do so by a crisis such as an 
extramarital affair, and by then it may be too late. 
</P>
<P>
"It's better to have small shakes than a major quake," Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
So he urges couples to allow for change and try to resolve their difficulties 
as they come up rather than carry over bad feelings from one day to the next. 
</P>
<P>
As couples get better at dealing with their conflicts, they need to balance 
those often-difficult encounters by finding more time for romance, said Owen's 
wife, Linda, who is also a family therapist. 
</P>
<P>
Just touching each other more can make a big difference, she said. 
</P>
<P>
She and her husband also offer couples this deceptively simple advice: "When 
touched, say 'thank you.' When angry, walk. When sad, hug. Whenever, laugh." 
</P>
<P>
Lee Hachey, a marriage and family counselor in Costa Mesa, agrees that couples 
should be more demonstrative; without open affection, too many end up "being 
like roommates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He and his wife, therapist Jeanne Nelson, share an end-of-the-day ritual that 
has given an indefinite life span to the honeymoon feeling in their marriage. 
Whoever gets home first drops whatever he or she is doing when the other 
arrives and offers an embrace and a far-from-perfunctory kiss at the front 
door. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes a tremendous difference when you drive up to your house and you know 
you're going to be greeted at the door -- and not just with a peck on the 
cheek. You really feel like you're coming home," Hachey said. 
</P>
<P>
He said people who don't greet their partner warmly at the end of the day may 
be inhibited by a fear of rejection. They may also worry that their affection 
will be misinterpreted as a sexual advance. Or they may feel pressure because 
they have misread an embrace from their partner. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to make it clear that this is just a greeting," Hachey stressed. "If 
sexual feelings occur, it doesn't mean it's a demand. Once that's out in the 
open, you feel more free and the fears go down." 
</P>
<P>
While many therapists stressed the importance of couples forming stronger bonds 
in the new year, others focused on the needs of children. 
</P>
<P>
Patricia Adams, a Brea psychotherapist, said parents should resolve to set 
aside time every week for family activities that are sure to generate laughter. 
And, she added, there should be a daily family meal when the conversation 
focuses on the day's events and no negative topics are introduced. 
</P>
<P>
No matter how busy you are, find time each day to give your children undivided 
attention, advised Marian Blakely, a Placentia marriage, family and child 
counselor. 
</P>
<P>
"We're all busy but if we don't focus on whatever it is we're doing at the 
moment, nothing gets done with quality," she observed. "We're bathing the kid, 
but our mind is on the grocery list. If we don't give our attention to the 
activity at hand, it loses meaning." 
</P>
<P>
Ken Rhea, a Huntington Beach psychotherapist, suggested that each parent spend 
time alone with each child "so the kids don't get lumped together." He 
remembers sitting in the car with his dad at fast-food restaurants when he was 
a child, sharing talk over a hamburger and fries. "That was a special time 
because we were away from home, and I knew if I had something to say, this was 
the time to bring it up and he wouldn't be distracted." 
</P>
<P>
Michael Dennis, a Huntington Beach therapist, said parents should not only 
spend more time with their children, but also show respect for them as 
individuals and resist the impulse to live through them vicariously. Dennis 
made a long list of resolutions for parents wanting to strengthen their 
relationship with their children. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
* "I will let my kids act their age." 
</P>
<P>
* "When disciplining, I will consider whether I am doing this to teach the 
child or to express my own anger and frustration, and I will make the 
consequences appropriate in degree, quantity and quality to the inappropriate 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
* "I will not take the good things for granted. I will notice the positives in 
my children and praise them more than criticize them." 
</P>
<P>
* "I will give my children a chance to show they can be trusted." 
</P>
<P>
Underlying those resolutions is a commitment that Helen Kohn, a Fullerton 
marriage and family therapist, described when she said the most important thing 
that families can do "is treat each other kindly and with love." 
</P>
<P>
She sees many abuse victims who grew up associating love with pain. "Many 
people grow up thinking love hurts, and they get into relationships where this 
is fulfilled," she explained. "Love should be meaningful, gentle and 
fulfilling, and we need to teach our children that." 
</P>
<P>
Joan P. LaMontagne, a psychologist who practices in Mission Viejo and Irvine, 
feels that couples are too quick to break up troubled marriages at the expense 
of their children. She wants to see more couples try to work out their problems 
within the context of an "unconditional commitment to marriage." 
</P>
<P>
"The holy commitment to marriage has been lost in the need for the institution 
to change, but I think we will come back around to that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Although LaMontagne and other therapists are optimistic that New Year's 
resolutions such as these can lead to better relationships, they caution 
couples not to get carried away by good intentions when the champagne starts to 
flow. 
</P>
<P>
As Gerry Owen pointed out, you'll only be disappointed if you make resolutions 
that you can't back up with actions. 
</P>
<P>
"Decide what you need to do and say to help make your resolutions work," he 
advised. "And give yourself credit for small steps you take on the path to big 
goals."

HUMBUG! For the first time in six years, the Orange County Fire Department 
won't hold its postseason Christmas tree burns. . . . "The burning was so 
dramatic," recalled a spokesman, showing "hundreds of spectators that the trees 
will flash and be fully engulfed in two or three seconds." But air-pollution 
authorities denied a permit after the burnings became so popular that other 
agencies wanted to join in. Tom Hamilton and Mark Landsbaum

INSTEAD: County firefighters will help in the effort to "recycle" trees. 
</P>
<P>
Following the lead of Irvine and Orange last year, six other cities will pick 
up discarded Christmas trees and grind each one into about a bucketful of 
garden mulch. . . . The process saves dwindling landfill space. "The flocked 
trees we do not need; they gum up the machinery," a spokeswoman said. . . . New 
to the effort his year: Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley, Laguna Niguel, Los 
Alamitos, Mission Viejo, Seal Beach. Call your city hall for information. Tom

MAN DIES IN SHERMAN OAKS FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 75-year-old man who lived in a hillside home overlooking the San Fernando 
Valley was found dead in his bedroom this morning after fire raced through the 
house, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the 1 a.m. fire in the 15400 block of Briarwood Drive in Sherman 
Oaks was not known, but investigators were looking into the possibility that an 
electric heater may have sparked the blaze that caused an estimated $560,000 in 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police described the victim, whose name was not released while 
investigators attempted to learn if he had any family, as a "pack rat." He had 
filled much of the house with newspapers, magazines and other belongings. There 
were several heaters spaced throughout the house, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles firefighters took 50 minutes to extinguish the fire that apparently 
erupted in the middle section of the ranch-style house on a hill overlooking 
the San Diego Freeway and the West Valley. Firefighters said the house was 
gutted by the fire, and a car was also destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Police investigators were called to the scene because firefighters found what 
appeared to be a bump-like injury on the victim's head. But neighbors told 
officers that the victim already had the deformity and foul play was ruled out.

Orange County had one traffic death during the five-day Christmas holiday 
period that ended at midnight Tuesday, law officials said today. Officers said 
the Christmas-traffic fatality rate this year is obviously low given that the 
county has more than 2 million residents. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange County coroner's office said the sole traffic death during the 
five-day period was on Saturday. Deputy William King said a 19-year-old 
Fountain Valley youth lost control of his car while southbound on the San Diego 
Freeway near the Magnolia Street on-ramp. King said the car struck a call box, 
and the driver, Major J. Johnson, was fatally injured. 
</P>
<P>
Despite thousands of vehicles on the county's freeways, highways and surface 
streets, there were relatively few major traffic accidents during the holiday 
period, according to the Orange County Sheriff's Department and the California 
Highway Patrol.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today named a surprise choice for the new post 
of vice president -- a career Communist official who climbed through the party 
apparatus to join the Politburo. 
</P>
<P>
Gennady Yanayev, 53, an ethnic Russian who previously headed the Young 
Communist League and the official trade union, was criticized by some deputies 
as an old-style conservative who would slow reform. 
</P>
<P>
But Gorbachev defended his candidate as "an active defender of and participant 
in perestroika," and Yanayev said he supports Gorbachev's reforms although he 
called for caution in the move toward a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of a Russian as vice president was a surprise partly because of 
the widespread belief that Gorbachev would choose an official from one of the 
other 14 republics to offset charges the central government was unsympathetic 
to ethnic minorities. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev said last week he was ready to nominate Foreign Minister Eduard A. 
Shevardnadze for vice president, but Shevardnadze then resigned and 
subsequently refused the post. 
</P>
<P>
No other names were placed in nomination today. Voting was to be by secret 
ballot tonight with results to be announced Thursday. More than half the voting 
deputies would have to cast ballots against Yanayev to force another 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
Several deputies objected to the fact that there were no alternative 
candidates, but others said Gorbachev should have the right to choose his own 
Cabinet and vice president. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev, a historian by profession, is a longtime Communist Party official who 
earlier this year was made a full member of the party's ruling Politburo. He 
was formerly head of the party's youth organization, the Komsomol, and briefly 
served as head of the official trade union organization. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a bad time for the republics," said Algimantas Chekuolis, a Lithuanian 
deputy and newspaper editor who was observing but not participating in the 
Congress. "We got another Gorbachev, a complete apparachik a la Gorbachev."

The State Department today added Sudan and Jordan to a list of six other Middle 
East and African countries where Americans connected to U.S. embassies are 
being ordered home or permitted to return voluntarily as a result of "unstable 
conditions" related to the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said these conditions have intensified following the decision 
of the U.N. Security Council to set a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi troops to 
withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
All non-essential personnel and dependents of U.S. government personnel are 
being asked to leave Jordan and Sudan "well before the Jan. 15 deadline," the 
announcement said. The State Department also recommended that U.S. citizens 
defer travel to the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
The decisions concerning the six other countries had been announced earlier. 
Those countries are Yemen, Mauritania, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar 
and Saudi Arabia's Eastern province. 
</P>
<P>
There has been strong pro-Iraqi sentiment in both Jordan and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
The statement indicates concern over the possibility that pro-Iraqi sentiment 
in the eight countries could be directed at U.S. diplomatic offices. Large 
anti-American demonstrations have taken place in the Sudan and Jordan.

Emergency medical care at a Chinese zoo saved two star performing pandas that 
had become critically ill because of intestinal problems, an official newspaper 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Liberation Daily said today that the pandas at the Fuzhou Zoo in 
southeastern Fujian province were near death when their condition was diagnosed 
as acute intestinal inflammation and intestinal blockage. 
</P>
<P>
The diagnosis was made early this month after zoo officials held urgent 
consultations with medical and animal experts, the newspaper said. After nine 
days of special treatment, Qingqing and Yuanyuan recovered, it said. 
</P>
<P>
Qingqing, 15, and Yuanyuan, 9, have performed for audiences around the world, 
including stops in the United States, Australia and Hong Kong. Their popular 
stunts include riding bicycles, doing somersaults and dunking a basketball.

By the year 2001, women for the first time will earn more doctorates than men, 
there will be more high school graduates than the 1977 peak and the ranks of 
classroom teachers will swell, the Education Department projected today. 
</P>
<P>
The trends for the next 10 years are included in the Education Department's 
publication, "Projections of Education Statistics to 2001. " 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, women earned 7,800 doctoral degrees, while men earned 26,300, the 
department said. Trends now indicate the ratio will flip. By 2001, women are 
expected to earn 18,900 doctorates, while men will earn just 17,300. 
</P>
<P>
However, the Education Department said men will continue to earn more 
professional degrees than women in such fields as medicine and law.

DENG SEEN IN PUBLIC FOR FIRST TIME SINCE JULY

Senior leader Deng Xiaoping today made his first public appearance since July, 
voting in citywide elections in the capital. The 86-year-old leader, widely 
believed to be suffering from cancer, appeared frail. 
</P>
<P>
Deng was shown on state television moving steadily but a bit shakily up to the 
voter registration table, where he sat down to sign his name. His daughter held 
his arm as he walked to the ballot box and dropped his ballot in. 
</P>
<P>
However, the official New China News Agency described Deng as walking 
vigorously to the polling station inside Zhongnanhai, the Communist Party's 
vast, red-walled compound in central Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"With a beaming smile on his face, Deng received a voting slip from a young 
election worker after showing his elector's card," the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Deng had not made a confirmed appearance in public since July when he visited 
the Asian Games Village. A Japanese newspaper recently reported that a tourist 
saw Deng and President Yang Shangkun eating dinner in a public restaurant, but 
there was no official confirmation. 
</P>
<P>
Since the last sighting of Deng, rumors had circulated that he was on his 
deathbed, as happens whenever he is long absent. 
</P>
<P>
Although Deng retired nearly a year ago from his last official post, there is 
fear that his death will leave a power vacuum, with no single leader strong 
enough to hold together competing ideological and regional factions.

SALE OF EXISTING HOMES EDGES UP IN NOVEMBER;

HOUSING: ANALYSTS CREDIT THE SLIGHT 3% IMPROVEMENT TO CONTINUED DECLINES IN 
MORTGAGE RATES.

<P>
Sales of existing homes, boosted by falling mortgage rates, edged up 3% in 
November for the first increase since August, a real estate trade group said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The National Assn. of Realtors said sales of existing single-family homes 
climbed to a seasonally adjusted rate of 3.14 million units in November, 
following declines of 3.8% in October and 9.4% in September. 
</P>
<P>
The sales pace was only slightly better than the weak 3.05-million-unit pace 
set in October. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts credited the slight improvement to continued declines in mortgage 
rates. Rates on 30-year-fixed mortgages have fallen to the lowest levels in 
three years and stand at 9.64%. 
</P>
<P>
Rates had edged up in the period following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, 
but in recent weeks they have resumed their downward path as the Federal 
Reserve has moved aggressively to fight a stagnant economy with lower interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
Harley E. Rouda, president of the realtors group, said he believes that 
consumers who were "scared off" by the financial market disruption in August 
and September were beginning to buy homes again. 
</P>
<P>
"Once mortgage rates settled down, consumers felt more at ease about buying a 
home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The median price for a home in November was $91,300, down 1.7% from the level 
in October and down 1.9% from the median price a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
The November sales increase was led by strength in the South and West. Sales in 
the South jumped 7.3%, while sales in the West were up 2%. 
</P>
<P>
Sales continued to slump in the Northeast, falling 2%. Sales in the Midwest 
were unchanged.

STORES HOPE TO GAIN LUSTER LOST IN SLOW-MOVING HOLIDAY SEASON

<P>
Shopkeepers across the country looked for bargain-hunting buyers today, hoping 
to clear out slow-moving holiday merchandise that made this a lackluster 
season. 
</P>
<P>
Today is traditionally one of the busiest shopping days of the year, as hordes 
descend to return gifts and comb aisles for after-Christmas deals. 
</P>
<P>
"Generally, I think retailers would be quite pleased if their sales matched 
what they were a year ago," said David A. Williamson, a retail analyst for the 
Advest Group Inc., an investment research company in Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
"Profits (from pre-Christmas sales) will be at least 10% below a year ago," he 
said. "Consumers were very tight with their dollars. Retailers had to be very 
promotional just to get customers into the stores, let alone buy stuff." 
</P>
<P>
Prospects for a reversal of the lackluster holiday shopping season were slight, 
with much of the country mired in economic recession, but buyers who take 
advantage of steep markdowns on Christmas cards, decorations and wrapping paper 
might help ease storekeepers' pain somewhat.

DOW GAINS 15.84 IN LIGHTLY ATTENDED POST-YULE SESSION

The stock market bounced higher in slow trading today as traders straggled back 
from the Christmas holiday. 
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed with a gain of 15.84 points at 
2,637.13. In the broader market, advancing stocks outpaced decliners by a 7-6 
margin. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was a very light 78.73 million 
shares, against Monday's four-year low of 57.20 million. 
</P>
<P>
Traders said stocks were boosted by the Treasury bond market, where the 
benchmark 30-year issue rose about two-thirds of a point. Higher bond prices 
mean lower interest rates that make stocks a more attractive investment. 
</P>
<P>
But traders said that with the very light volume, it was hard to predict a 
clear trend. They noted little enthusiasm for chasing after stocks as 1990 
winds down. 
</P>
<P>
The showdown in the Persian Gulf appears to have dampened expectations for any 
sort of New Year's rally after the pressure of tax selling is lifted from the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
Many questions also linger about the economic outlook. Early news reports 
described the returns from retailers' Christmas selling season as very weak and 
a big disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
Gainers among the blue chips included Texaco, up 1 5/8 at 60 3/8 an hour before 
the close; Philip Morris, up 1/2 at 51 3/8; Ford Motor, up 1/2 at 26 7/8, and 
USX, up 1/4 at 30 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
Among retailing stocks, The Limited added 1/8 to 17 7/8, but Wal-Mart Stores 
dropped 3/8 to 31 1/8 and Toys R Us was down 3/8 at 22 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
Pan Am Corp. was up 1/8 at 1 3/8. The company said it has not ended merger 
discussions with Trans World Airlines Inc., but said it is waiting for TWA to 
make a firm, detailed offer. 
</P>
<P>
UAL Corp. rose sharply, gaining 2 1/2 to 115 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
"We've seen sporadic buying throughout the morning," one trader said. "But it's 
been very, very light. Professional traders are not doing much." 
</P>
<P>
Don Hays, an investment strategist at Wheat First Securities, said the market's 
strength was purely seasonal. "There are so few players that bargain-hunters 
are pushing stocks higher." 
</P>
<P>
Hays said the market was ignoring negative influences such as higher oil and 
gold prices.

Heather Farr, who made a comeback on the LPGA Tour this year after breast 
cancer surgery in 1989, has had a recurrence of the disease and will undergo 
chemotherapy and a bone marrow transplant. 
</P>
<P>
"My breast cancer has returned inside the bone," Farr, 25, said today. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a spot in the back of my skull and a spot in a back vertebrae." 
</P>
<P>
The former Arizona State standout was coming off her most successful year on 
the LPGA Tour when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in July, 1989, and 
underwent a mastectomy. 
</P>
<P>
After a series of chemotherapy treatments, Farr received a clean bill of health 
this summer and was looking forward to rejoining the tour. 
</P>
<P>
But Farr said she had to stop golfing in November due to a pain in her back and 
now finds that even common chores are becoming difficult. 
</P>
<P>
Farr's problems are not limited to the stress of fighting cancer. She said her 
medical insurance dropped her this fall and she does not know how she will pay 
for her operation, estimated by her doctors to cost between $150,000 and 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
She will begin chemotherapy probably next week at the Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center in Los Angeles for about six weeks.

PATRIOTS SEE SLIM PICKINGS AT NO. 1 SPOT

<P>
Joe Mendes, top talent sleuth for the New England Patriots, looks at draft 
picks as currency. But he knows they aren't really worth anything unless you 
spend them wisely. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunes can be won and lost, Super Bowl champions determined and dynasties 
built, depending on how judiciously NFL draft picks are invested. 
</P>
<P>
Pick, say, a Bruce Smith, and you've hit the jackpot. Pick a Ken Sims and you 
might go bust. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to Mendes and the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots likely will have the first pick in the 1991 draft, a richly 
deserved reward for finishing with the poorest record in the league this 
season. But -- and doesn't it just figure with the simply sordid season the 
Patriots are having -- the pick is of questionable value. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been defined that there is no clear-cut first pick in the draft," said 
Mendes, the Patriots' director of player operations. 
</P>
<P>
It gets worse. 
</P>
<P>
"It is not a great draft," Mendes said. 
</P>
<P>
No franchise player. No great surplus of talent. No way for the Patriots to get 
better in a hurry? No, sir. 
</P>
<P>
With seven picks in the first four rounds, including the big one at the top, 
the Patriots are in position to help themselves considerably. It will depend on 
what Mendes and new Patriots Chief Executive Officer Sam Jankovich come up 
with. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll look at a lot of avenues and go with the one that is the best value," 
Mendes said. "We can keep the (first overall) pick and draft the player that we 
consider the best player in the country. We can attempt to trade the pick for 
multiple choices or a combination of multiple picks, plus players. Or we can 
trade the pick for a veteran player or veteran players. . . . It's just a 
matter of time to see what avenue is the best one to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
"New England has to trade down," said Mel Kiper Jr., ESPN's draft analyst. "I 
don't think New England can afford to keep the pick. They need too much help." 
</P>
<P>
Kiper thinks Raghib Ismail will be the first player taken in the draft, even 
though the Notre Dame flash has said he intends to return for his senior year. 
Kiper believes Ismail will come out when he realizes he would be the first 
player drafted and be guaranteed lifetime financial security. 
</P>
<P>
Would this mean the Patriots would take Ismail? Probably not. But they would be 
able to find someone who would like that opportunity, someone, say, like 
Dallas, which is sitting in the catbird seat with no less than three 
first-round draft picks in '91. Atlanta also has two first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
Without a quarterback the quality of a Jeff George in the draft, don't look for 
a blockbuster deal such as the Indianapolis Colts and the Atlanta Falcons 
executed before the last draft (first overall pick to Indianapolis from Atlanta 
for Andre Rison, Chris Hinton and a No. 1 in '91). But the Dallas Cowboys or 
Falcons might be persuaded to accept the top spot in the draft and, say, Irving 
Fryar or Hart Lee Dykes or John Stephens and another pick or two or from the 
Patriots in exchange for two of their first-round picks. 
</P>
<P>
A trade may be the best way to go, too, judging by the Patriots' track record 
with the top overall pick. They've been in that position three times. In 1971 
they took Stanford quarterback Jim Plunkett; in 1982 they took Sims, a 
defensive tackle from Texas; and in 1984 they took Fryar, a wide receiver from 
Nebraska. Only Plunkett had the type of success -- two Super Bowl victories -- 
equal to the position he was drafted, and that came after he had joined the 
Raiders.

Total handle, which includes off-track wagering, for the fall meeting at

THIS MIGHT BE A GOOD TIME FOR DALY TO PUT PANIC BUTTON IN POCKET

<TEXT>
<P>
The Detroit Pistons appear to have confused the idea of following the bouncing 
ball with playing like one. Yet only Isiah Thomas appears concerned. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Chuck Daly knows only too well the gruesome details of this nosedive, 
anticipates only too cleverly the doomsday questions and shoves both out of the 
way with a generous sweep of his arm. 
</P>
<P>
After a 13-2 start (the best in club history), after eight losses in the last 
10 games, after four straight losses on the road, after getting hammered 98-86 
by archrival Chicago on Christmas Day, the two-time defending NBA titleists are 
16-11. 
</P>
<P>
Daly's what-me-worry? grin says . . . so what? His demeanor suggests that he 
hasn't reached for the panic button in so long that he probably forgot where he 
flung it after the last time. 
</P>
<P>
After 27 games last season, Daly reminds us, the Pistons were 17-10. He seems 
secure in the knowledge that the players, without much interference from 
himself (or anyone else for that matter), will take care of the big problems 
themselves. Maybe early in the season is the time to be cavalier. 
</P>
<P>
Not so the doubting Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
"I keep telling people this is a little bit different. Last year, when we were 
losing, we were playing hard. We don't have the same type of attitude to win," 
he said. "We don't have the right, proper frame of mind. Until we get that, 
we'll be bouncing up and down all season." 
</P>
<P>
"We have the talent," Thomas added, his voice trailing off ominously, "but if 
you don't make full use of it. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
You get beat. The comfortable world the champions have known these last few 
seasons has changed dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Forget for the moment that whichever Western Conference opponent winds up 
standing in the way of a three-peat, most likely the rugged, much more 
versatile Trail Blazers, it will put up more resistance than the swinging gate 
they have proven in recent years. The Pistons still have to get there. 
</P>
<P>
And closer to home, in the Eastern Conference, Boston has proven it is back in 
a big way, Philadelphia is deeper and more dangerous, Milwaukee no longer 
guarantees Holiday Inn-type visits ("No surprises") and after Tuesday night, 
even the Bulls, three straight years the Pistons' playoff foil, the last two in 
the conference finals, will not be so quick to back down. 
</P>
<P>
Daly is surely right when he notes that Detroit is still in the forefront of 
the league's most dangerous teams, that when the Pistons are on -- playing with 
alertness and intensity -- "we're some kind of basketball team." 
</P>
<P>
But Thomas is surely just as right when he cautions that NBA championship rings 
are not the result of getting up for some games and not others. And that simply 
paying attention is not the same as paying the price. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is not so pessimistic that he rules out a return to form in the near 
term if the Pistons start paying attention to the task at hand. But based on 
what he is seeing in opponents' eyes, Thomas is considerably gloomier about a 
return to championship form. 
</P>
<P>
Asked what it would require, he was straightforward. "A different attitude," 
Thomas said. "Or different people." 
</P>
<P>
Just before leaving Chicago Stadium, teammate Joe Dumars confided that, despite 
nearly identical records, he too felt the Pistons were not playing as well as 
last year, adding, "It's not time to panic with so many games to go." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe not. But this might be a good time for Daly to start rummaging around for 
the button -- just in case it comes in handy.

'GODFATHER III' SETS YULE OPENING RECORD; 
</P>
<P>
BOX OFFICE: SEQUEL HAS TICKET SALES OF $6.3 MILLION ON 1,800 SCREENS. 'HOME 
ALONE' TOPS FIVE-DAY CHARTS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Francis Coppola's "The Godfather Part III" opened Tuesday with an all-time 
Christmas Day record. 
</P>
<P>
The long-awaited sequel had ticket sales of approximately $6.3 million on 1,800 
screens, for a per-screen-average of $3,461. 
</P>
<P>
At press time, based on the film's single-day performance, it tied for third 
place in the top 10. 
</P>
<P>
Ticket sales of $6.3 million are a high figure for a day that is not 
traditionally a big moviegoing day, but not as high as some industry sources 
were expecting when weighed against the level of anticipation and the enormous 
amount of publicity that accompanied the film's release. 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some exhibitor sources reported that the film played largely to 
adults and that while it was SRO in the big cities, its performance was "weak" 
in smaller cities. There were also concerns about whether the Christmas Day 
crowd will widen to include the teen-age audiece. As one exhibitor put it, "The 
film's real test will come this weekend." 
</P>
<P>
Paramount Pictures was quick to rebuff any dimming of what the studio sees as a 
bright Christmas Day performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ecstatic! This movie has exceeded our expectations," declared Barry 
London, Paramount's motion picture group president in charge of distribution. 
London added that he has been in touch with Coppola about the figures, "and he 
is delighted." 
</P>
<P>
Though news about "Godfather III" dominated the reports of moviegoing over the 
five-day holiday period -- Friday through Tuesday -- it was "Home Alone" that 
topped the charts. 
</P>
<P>
The 20th Century-Fox comedy about an 8-year-old who must fend for himself over 
the holidays had ticket sales of about $15.4 million on 2,108 screens -- for a 
per-screen average of $7,305. That's an impressive number considering the film 
had already played for five weeks. The season's PG-rated runaway sleeper has 
grossed more than $115 million. 
</P>
<P>
In the No. 2 spot, with receipts of about $11.1 million, was Universal 
Pictures' just-out "Kindergarten Cop," starring Arnold Schwarzenegger as a 
tough cop who goes undercover as a kindergarten teacher. The PG-13-rated film, 
which drew critical complaints because of its mix of violence and comedy, 
played on about 1,830 screens, where it had a per-screen average of $6,058 -- 
the highest of the weekend's new releases. 
</P>
<P>
Tied for third place was "The Godfather III" and Orion Picture's "Dances With 
Wolves," both with ticket sales of about $6.3 million. In estimated figures, 
fifth and sixth places were claimed by holdovers "Edward Scissorhands" (Fox, 
$6.2 million) and "Looks Who's Talking Too" (Tri-Star Pictures, $5.8 million). 
</P>
<P>
MGM/UA's just-out "Russia House" was No. 7 with ticket sales of about $4.4 
million. Based on John Le Carre's best-selling espionage thriller and starring 
Sean Connery and Michelle Pfeiffer, the film opened to mixed reviews and on 768 
screens, where it averaged $5,729. 
</P>
<P>
Another new title, Warner Bros.' "Bonfire of the Vanities" -- starring Tom 
Hanks, Bruce Willis and Melanie Griffith -- was eighth, with receipts of about 
$4.2 million on 1,373 screens for a disappointing per-screen average of $3,058. 
</P>
<P>
Rounding out the top 10, in estimated figures, were the holdover titles 
"Misery" (Columbia, $4.1 million) and "Three Men and a Little Lady" (Buena 
Vista, $3.4 million). Meanwhile, Orion's "Mermaids" starring Cher and Winona 
Ryder, plummeted to 11th place in its second weekend with ticket sales of about 
$3.4 million.

LIZ SMITH: THREATS PROVIDE BELATED ENDING TO EXPOSE ON TRUMP

AFTER THIS column broke the scoop last week that former Trump executive Jack 
O'Donnell will bring out a hot and sizzling expose sometime next spring -- a 
book to be titled "Trumped! The Decline &amp; Fall of Donald Trump" -- I 
received a call from Jack. 
</P>
<P>
He said: "You know, Liz, I had no ending for my book, no denouement. But after 
your story appeared in print, Donald sent lawyers here to my office to threaten 
me. They said he would accuse me of being a morally lax person and all kinds of 
other stuff. They made intimidating threats that weren't even thinly veiled. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, I had not used the book to include all the things I knew about 
Donald's use of pressure to get whatever he wants. I had left most of that out 
and did not bear down on it. But this was just the last straw. Thank you for 
giving me the press that provided an ending to my book." 
</P>
<P>
YOU CAN see Ivana Trump and Marla Maples in People magazine's "Most Intriguing 
of 1990" year-end issue, under an amusing headline, "Marla vs. Ivana: How to 
Tell Them Apart." Sample "Marla looks 35, is 27. . . . Ivana looks 35, is 41." 
</P>
<P>
Ivana did not hold her annual all-girl Christmas lunch this year. Instead, her 
pal Kathy Keaton gave a small private celebration for Ivana and her mother, 
Maria, in the marble palace Kathy occupies with hubby Bob Guccione on 
Manhattan's East Side. (Kathy is the tycoon publisher-editor of Omni and 
Longevity magazines.) 
</P>
<P>
Lunch began with heaps of caviar and went on to bigger and better things. Each 
of the privileged few received a terrific flagon of designer Pauline Trigere's 
hard-to-get perfume "Liquid Chic." (You have to buy this from Pauline direct.) 
</P>
<P>
Ivana says she was going to Aspen with the children after Christmas because she 
made reservations there months ago. At the time, she had no idea Marla also 
planned to return. Ivana is not, as reported elsewhere, going to Palm Beach.

George Hamilton, who hasn't had a role in a feature film since 1981, almost 
didn't end up in "The Godfather, Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton, 51, plays a WASP lawyer who sets up a deal for the Corleone family 
with the Vatican Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton said in the January issue of Vanity Fair that his agent at first 
turned down the role because he had been told it would be a cameo. 
</P>
<P>
"You did what?" he recalled telling his agent. "We're talking about 'The 
Godfather' here." 
</P>
<P>
Finally Hamilton called director Francis Ford Coppola in Italy, and Coppola 
assured him that he still wanted the actor. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'Francis, you're telling me that you will work with me to make it 
good. That's all I need.' And I jumped on a plane and went to Rome," Hamilton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
It was his first role since "Zorro, the Gay Blade" in 1981. Hamilton's other 
movie credits include "Love at First Bite" and "Where the Boys Are."

<P>
An interviewer asked me the other day to list my childhood role models. 
</P>
<P>
I named my father, but then I got stuck. I finally muttered something about not 
really having had role models, leaving the interviewer to conclude that I 
imagined myself so special that I didn't see the necessity of having anyone to 
look up to. 
</P>
<P>
It wasn't so much that I couldn't think of other people whose skills or 
erudition or swagger I dreamed of emulating as it was the embarrassing 
triviality of my boyish dreams. 
</P>
<P>
I mean, should I have told him about Uncle Ernest, whose amateur singing and 
guitar playing I admired? Or Odell Smith, whose wit made him such a success 
with the girls? Or Dolan Falconer, basketball star, raconteur and all-around 
rascal, who was the envy of so many of us younger boys? 
</P>
<P>
I might have mentioned C. D. Gardner, the math teacher and bandmaster I worked 
so hard to please, or Earl Williams, the only teacher who ever talked to us 
about sex. But the more I think about it, the more I am convinced that the very 
term "role model" is misleading, evidence of nothing so much as our ability to 
forget what mattered to us when we were children. 
</P>
<P>
Our schools hold career days in the forlorn hope that 15 minutes with a 
successful lawyer or physician will persuade unambitious youngsters to study. 
We keep looking for ways to establish links between the people we admire and 
the children who we believe need the inspiration of their success. And we are 
forever chiding sports heroes for their nonathletic shortcomings, on the ground 
that their ethical and moral lapses will lead our children into similar 
behavior. It's as though we believe that a kid who admires Dexter Manley's 
ability to harass NFL quarterbacks will also admire the illiteracy Manley 
tearfully admitted or the drug abuse that threatened his athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
The interesting thing is that the adults who have such faith in role models 
seem to have no memory of their own childhoods. I know men who spent their 
adolescence mimicking Stan Musial's batting stance or Willie Mays' "basket" 
catches. They never wanted to be like Musial or Mays, in part because they knew 
nothing of these heroes except for their athletic ability. But they earnestly 
believe that hauling Sugar Ray Leonard or Doug Williams in front of an 
elementary school class will make a difference in the lives of children. 
</P>
<P>
Talk to them, though, and you get a different picture. Ask them about their 
childhood role models. They'll nearly always name a parent or other adult who 
spent time with them and paid attention to them and nudged them toward better 
behavior. What these fondly remembered adults did for a living, or how much 
they made at it, is largely irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
I don't mean to suggest that children shouldn't have heroes, or that they 
cannot benefit from exposure to people who have achieved professional success. 
What I am suggesting is that the benefit consists largely of how-to lessons: 
how to resist negative peer pressure, how to achieve in the face of economic 
difficulty, how to find adults who can help them to fulfill their career 
dreams. "Mentoring," as we now call it, can be invaluable. But it has little to 
do with "role modeling," as the term is commonly used. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, confusion of the two notions may even be detrimental to real role 
modeling. To the extent that we insist that the role models we foist on our 
children be economically successful -- particularly the despairing children of 
the inner cities -- we undervalue the men and women in the neighborhood whose 
attitudes and behavior are so deserving of emulation. 
</P>
<P>
Of course we should introduce children to successful adults, especially those 
who grew up in circumstances similar to those in which the children now find 
themselves. They need to understand that poverty or race needn't be a bar to 
achievement. 
</P>
<P>
Role modeling, as we tend to talk about it, is too much involved with money and 
professional status: what a person has accomplished. The role modeling that 
matters is involved with standards and behavior: what a person is. We'd do our 
children a favor if we learned the difference.
