JOEL JACOBSON; FORMER NEW JERSEY CASINO REGULATOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joel Jacobson, 71, a former casino regulator who once called Frank Sinatra "an 
obnoxious bully" and was later appointed court trustee of a scandal-ridden 
Teamsters local in New Jersey. Jacobson, a longtime labor union official, 
joined the state Casino Control Commission in 1981. His comment about Sinatra 
came in 1984 after the singer and fellow entertainer Dean Martin forced a 
blackjack dealer at the former Golden Nugget casino in Atlantic City to deal 
from her hand instead of the plastic "shoe," which holds the cards. Jacobson's 
remark so angered Sinatra that he refused to perform in the state for a time. 
Jacobson resigned from the commission in June, 1986, and was appointed by a 
federal judge to run Union City-based Teamsters Local 560 until May, 1987. In 
Livingston, N.J., on Tuesday of undisclosed causes.

ABANDONED SNAKES POSE A MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS KRAUL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Describing the reptilian horde as a "scene out of an Indiana Jones movie," San 
Diego Zoo officials Wednesday were trying to identify the 225 nonpoisonous 
snakes impounded at a vacant Vista residence. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, county officials wondered why the owner apparently abandoned the 
valuable creatures. 
</P>
<P>
Officers from the San Diego County Department of Animal Control seized the 
snakes Tuesday on Lado de Loma Drive after neighbors complained of a stench to 
the county Sheriff's Department. Deputies entered the house, found several dead 
snakes among the poorly tended live ones, and called in animal control 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
While neither the county nor the Sheriff's Department could identify the 
snakes' owner as of late Wednesday, a former owner of the house said he sold 
the residence in early December to James R. King of El Cajon, who reportedly 
described himself to a real estate agent as a "reptile wholesaler." 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach King at an El Cajon telephone listing were unsuccessful 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The haul included 225 live snakes, about a dozen dead ones, 20 exotic species 
of frogs and a handful of lizards, said Sally Hazzard, county animal control 
director. The animals, which apparently had not been given food or water for 
some time, were turned over to the temporary custody of the zoo Wednesday 
morning for veterinary care and identification. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the snakes were found Tuesday night in plastic foam cups and plastic 
containers, zoo spokesman Jeff Jouett said. The reptiles "were all extremely 
thirsty and went immediately to the water when it was put in their pens" at the 
zoo, he said. Jouett described some of the baby snakes as dehydrated. 
</P>
<P>
Notations were made on some of the snakes' pens that indicated to zoo officials 
that the animals may have last been fed and watered Nov. 9, Jouett said. 
</P>
<P>
The owner may face criminal charges if the county determines that the snakes 
were mistreated, Vista Assistant City Manager Jeanette Farris said. The owner 
may be in misdemeanor violation of a Vista law that prohibits homeowners from 
keeping more than 25 snakes or from owning pythons or boa constrictors longer 
than 3 1/2 feet or weighing more than 15 pounds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Jouett said the haul of snakes included a crate full of "20 or more" pythons 
and boa constrictors that range from 5 to 12 feet in length. 
</P>
<P>
Although the snakes "appeared to be abandoned," Deputy Sheriff Larry van Dusen 
said law enforcement officials would not try to identify or locate the snakes' 
owner unless the animal control department determines that there may have been 
criminal neglect of the animals. 
</P>
<P>
Hazzard said her department is awaiting the zoo's medical evaluation and 
identification of the animals before fully assessing the case. 
</P>
<P>
Zoning laws that govern what kinds of animals may be kept in given areas and 
the required "methods of containment" must also be evaluated by the county, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"No one knows how long the animals have been abandoned," Hazzard said. "But 
there is criminal liability, in general, if an owner does not provide adequate 
food, water and shelter for their animals." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, animal control officers posted a notice at the Vista house 
saying that the reptiles' owner must come forward within five days to claim the 
animals or forfeit ownership. After that, the county would be free to sell the 
snakes at auction, or dispose of them to zoos or the state Department of Fish 
and Game, Hazzard said. 
</P>
<P>
Although the zoo has not yet finished identifying the reptiles, Jouett 
described them as all nonpoisonous. The snakes identified include rare, 
12-foot-long albino Burmese pythons and albino king snakes, as well as a 
variety of king snakes, rat snakes, garter snakes and rosy boa constrictors. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Sipperley, owner of San Diego Reptile Breeders, said adult albino Burmese 
pythons could be worth up to $4,000 each. The albino pythons "are a fairly new 
genetic strain that's become available in the last five years. That's why 
they're so valuable. There aren't that many available at this point."

SDG&amp;E WITHDRAWS FROM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, upset by the Greater San Diego Chamber of 
Commerce's active opposition to the utility's proposed merger with Southern 
California Edison, will not renew its long-running membership in the business 
and civic group, SDG&amp;E's chief operating officer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Opposition to the merger, which SDG&amp;E officials believe will benefit San 
Diego's business community, is "inconsistent with the chamber's goal of 
supporting causes that enhance the economic well-being of this city and 
county," Jack E. Thomas said. The chamber's steadfast and highly public 
opposition to the merger makes it "awkward" for SDG&amp;E to remain in the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
Chamber President Lee Grissom said SDG&amp;E has been a "very good and 
supportive member of the chamber" since joining in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
"While the withdrawal disappoints us, it was not a surprise," Grissom said. "It 
was one of the considerations we had to (weigh) when we made the decision to 
take an opposing position to the Edison merger." 
</P>
<P>
Grissom described SDG&amp;E's decision to leave the chamber as proof that 
Rosemead-based Edison has largely taken control of the local utility. Since the 
merger surfaced, local utility managers have "done a corporate Chernobyl," 
Grissom said. "They just melted down inside." 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's absence will help to strengthen the chamber's opposition to the 
proposed merger, Grissom said. The chamber won't be hurt financially by 
SDG&amp;E's withdrawal because several chamber members have already volunteered 
to donate the equivalent of SDG&amp;E's dues, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E would 
have been assessed $23,000 in corporate dues for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The chamber had a $2.7-million budget during 1989, Grissom said. SDG&amp;E's 
dues were equivalent to about two weeks' worth of the chamber's payroll, 
Grissom said. 
</P>
<P>
He maintained that SDG&amp;E's management is out of step with the mainstream 
San Diego business community on the merger issue. According to results of a 
September poll authorized by the chamber, 56% of its members oppose the merger 
and 11% favor it. The remainder are undecided, according to the poll. 
</P>
<P>
SDG&amp;E's withdrawal from the chamber, "if anything, puts starch into our 
resolve," Grissom said. "It makes us stronger than before." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas, who will leave the chamber board of directors at the end of this year, 
maintained that SDG&amp;E "doesn't have a war with the chamber. . . . We intend 
to maintain a strong position in the business community with organizations that 
share our vision of the future." 
</P>
<P>
"While we respectfully acknowledge the stand the chamber has taken, we in good 
conscience cannot support it," Thomas said in a letter Tuesday to Pat Crowell, 
the chamber's chairman-elect. "The chamber should be, as it always has been, 
allied with SDG&amp;E. But it is not." 
</P>
<P>
"This is an interesting estrangement, in all honesty," Grissom said. "It's not 
a personal issue, because I have great respect for (SDG&amp;E Chairman) Tom 
Page. And we just reinvited (SDG&amp;E board member) Clair Burgener to be on 
our board. So it's not a personal issue."

DAMAGED TUNA BOAT WILL STAY IN PANAMA UNTIL COPTER RELEASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A San Diego-based tuna boat damaged in Panamanian waters evidently will remain 
there until U.S. military officials let the vessel's helicopter return from a 
nearby airport, according to August Felando, president of the San Diego-based 
American Tunaboat Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The Samoa Star remains docked near Panama City after being damaged when U.S. 
Navy commandos reportedly destroyed a nearby Panamanian patrol boat. 
</P>
<P>
The boat's helicopter is at Paitilla Airport, a small field near the Marriott 
Hotel in Panama City, said Felando, who talked to the crew by telephone. That 
area saw heavy fighting during the past week, and U.S. troops have decided to 
keep civilian flights to a minimum, a Department of Defense spokeswoman said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have particulars about that (helicopter), but good old common sense 
tells me that there won't be flights until we're sure that no one is going to 
shoot them down," the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Divers who examined the ship's hull earlier this week determined that the 
boat's sonar gear was damaged during the early-morning explosion Dec. 20, 
Felando said, but that the hull was seaworthy and that the 220-foot boat could 
return to San Diego for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
A second San Diego-based tuna boat that was tied off near the Samoa Star on 
Dec. 20, left Panama on Sunday but remains anchored offshore, Felando said. The 
Odette Therese, which was not damaged in the attack, evidently is waiting for 
U.S. military officials to allow its helicopter to take off from Paitilla 
Airport, Felando said. 
</P>
<P>
Crew members on the two boats escaped injury when the explosion destroyed the 
Panamanian patrol boat, about 1 a.m. Panama time as U.S. troops rushed to take 
control of Panama. 
</P>
<P>
U.S.-based tuna boats regularly travel the Panama Canal from fishing grounds in 
the Pacific Ocean to canneries in Puerto Rico. The ships were returning from 
Puerto Rico when hostilities broke out.

APPEAL COURT REFUSES TO FREE HUNTER FROM JAIL; 
</P>
<P>
CONVICTED: J. DAVID INVESTMENT SCANDAL FIGURE WILL REMAIN BEHIND BARS UNTIL HER 
FEBRUARY SENTENCING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Nancy Hoover Hunter, convicted earlier this month in San Diego federal court of 
four counts of tax evasion, must remain in jail pending formal sentencing in 
February, a federal appeals court has affirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter failed to convince the court that there was no risk she would flee 
should she be freed on bail, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court 
of Appeals said in a three-sentence ruling issued late Tuesday in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Earl B. Gilliam ordered Hunter to await sentencing at the 
federal Metropolitan Correctional Center in downtown San Diego immediately 
after she was found guilty Dec. 11 of the four counts of tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
The jury that convicted Hunter of those four counts also acquitted her of 
another tax-related charge but deadlocked on 192 other counts that centered on 
her role as a top executive in the La Jolla investment firm J. David Co. from 
1979 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
In all, investors lost about $80 million in the J. David affair, a giant Ponzi 
scheme in which prosecutors alleged that Hunter played a key role. The 192 
counts stemmed from Hunter's alleged involvement in the Ponzi scheme, a pyramid 
in which money from new investors is used to pay off earlier investors. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's defense lawyers contended she was blinded by her love for the firm's 
founder, J. David (Jerry) Dominelli, and was unaware of any illegal activities. 
Dominelli pleaded guilty in 1985 to four counts of fraud and tax evasion in 
connection with the Ponzi scheme and is serving a 20-year sentence in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter's trial, which began March 28, is believed to be the longest-running 
criminal case in the history of the San Diego federal court. Hunter, 51, a 
former Del Mar mayor, faces up to 20 years in prison, or five years on each of 
the counts, and is due to be sentenced Feb. 20. 
</P>
<P>
Her lawyers, Richard Marmaro of Los Angeles and Robert Brewer of San Diego, had 
urged the federal appeals court to release Hunter on bail pending sentencing, 
saying she had given no indication she would flee while under indictment for 
three years and during an eight-month trial. 
</P>
<P>
Sending her to jail without bail, the lawyers said, was "cruel and smacks of 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
The appellate judges were unconvinced, however, saying only that they backed 
Gilliam's move because Hunter had failed to show by "clear and convincing 
evidence" that she was not a flight risk. 
</P>
<P>
The ruling was signed by Judges Cecil F. Poole, Dorothy W. Nelson and Edward 
Leavy. There was no indication who wrote the short order. 
</P>
<P>
Hunter faces retrial on the 192 counts, also due to begin Feb. 20. After that 
trial is over, she faces a separate, 56-count indictment charging her with 
conspiracy and using the mails to sell unregistered securities. 
</P>
<P>
Gilliam has imposed a gag order on lawyers involved in the case that prevents 
them from discussing it with reporters.

HAWTHORNE STRIKES OUT LITTLE LEAGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There was no joy in Mudville when Mighty Casey struck out. 
</P>
<P>
The atmosphere in Hawthorne City Hall was not much better Tuesday when a group 
of Little League coaches and parents failed to persuade the City Council to 
reconsider eliminating a baseball diamond at Holly Park and replacing it with 
smaller softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
The project that began in October is converting a regulation-size baseball 
diamond and two smaller softball fields -- which are crowded together at Holly 
Park on West 120th Street -- with two upgraded softball fields. 
</P>
<P>
The changeover has forced about 75 teen-agers on five teams in the Holly Park 
Little League to travel a little more than three miles to another field. There, 
crowded schedules mean games may end after 11 p.m., prompting some youngsters 
to drop out, parents say. 
</P>
<P>
Sterling Jones, a Little League official, said 13- to 15-year-old players in 
the junior and senior divisions use a regulation diamond that is 90 feet from 
home plate to first base. The new softball diamonds will be 60 feet from home 
to first. (Little Leaguers under 13 years old can play on the 60-foot fields.) 
</P>
<P>
Jones suggested that the city convert one of the softball diamonds to the size 
required for older Little Leaguers. He also said that moveable bases and a 
pitching mound can be used to accommodate both softball and baseball. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking that you kill softball," he told the council Tuesday. "We 
just want you to accommodate the kids." 
</P>
<P>
But, like a foul ball that goes over the back stop, the suggestions attracted 
little response. 
</P>
<P>
The council members said they sympathize with the plight of the Little League, 
but they said the city does not have the money to redesign the park to include 
a 90-foot baseball diamond. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm sorry we can't accommodate everybody and every sport," said Councilman 
David M. York. 
</P>
<P>
The two softball diamonds are being installed because there are a growing 
number of adult softball leagues, including a league from Northrop Corp. The 
giant aerospace corporation has entered into a three-year agreement with the 
city to allow at least 60 Northrop teams to use one of the diamonds at Holly 
Park in exchange for a $90,000 donation, which was used to help build the park, 
according to Robert Klein, director of parks and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
Klein said the renovation project is expected to be completed by July and will 
cost about $850,000 -- practically all of which will come from state and 
federal grants. 
</P>
<P>
The renovation project will include landscaping, additional tennis courts and 
new lights for the basketball court and the softball diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's City Council meeting, the coaches and parents complained that 
they must drive their teen-agers to Jim Thorpe Memorial Park, at 14100 S. 
Prairie Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
Kathy Dahlum, an elementary teacher whose 9- and 15-year-old sons play in the 
Holly Park League, told the council that her sons sometimes get home after 11 
p.m. because the Holly Park league games begin after the Jim Thorpe Little 
League games are completed. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview Wednesday, Dahlum, who also helps coach, said many of the older 
players have dropped out of Little League because parents objected to their 
children getting home so late. 
</P>
<P>
She said that without baseball many youngsters "are going to be on the streets. 
They will have nothing to do." 
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Klein said that the Holly Park Little League teams can use 
the baseball diamonds at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, about 3 1/2 miles 
away. 
</P>
<P>
But coaches and parents rejected the idea, saying the school is too far away. 
They also complained that the Little League games would have to be played after 
the Leuzinger team's games are completed.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 42-year-old worker suffered burns and shock Wednesday when a tool he was 
using came in contact with a 12,000-volt power line at a parking garage 
construction site, the San Diego Fire Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
David Hernandez, of San Diegowas in guarded condition after undergoing surgery. 
He suffered third-degree burns on his neck, hands and upper body, UC San Diego 
Medical Center spokeswoman Barbara Brandt said. The 7 a.m. accident happened on 
the third level of a parking garage being built at 43rd and Meade streets. 
Hernandez was reportedly supporting a long, trowel-type tool, used in concrete 
work, on his neck and shoulders when it touched the power line. 
</P>
<P>
The state occupational safety agency was called in to investigate and all work 
was halted until the investigation is completed, a Fire Department spokesman 
said.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ENCINITAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A relatively mild form of hepatitis has infected seven elementary 
schoolchildren and one adult in Encinitas, the county Health Department said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The children, students at Paul Ecke Central School, are believed to have 
contracted hepatitis A from one infected student during a Thanksgiving 
kindergarten banquet at the school. 
</P>
<P>
Department spokesman Dave Carey said parents have been advised to have their 
children inoculated to protect against the disease, which has symptoms of 
fever, fatigue, nausea and jaundice. However, hepatitis A is a fairly mild 
version of the disease and is "rarely disabling," said Carey. 
</P>
<P>
The incubation period before symptoms appear is anywhere between 15 and 50 
days, and Carey said the illness lasts one to two weeks.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: RAMONA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Ramona child molester was granted a new attorney Wednesday. Michael Murphy 
will now represent Ezra Adams during the sentencing phase of his trial. 
</P>
<P>
Adams was found guilty of 86 counts of child molestation in November by 
Superior Court Judge Louis Boyle. Adams waived his right to a jury trial, 
leaving Boyle to decide his guilt or innocence. 
</P>
<P>
Murphy asked Superior Court Judge David M. Gill for two months to review 
transcripts of Adams' trial to prepare for sentencing and a possible motion 
requesting a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 20 at Adam's request, Boyle relieved attorney Roy Gunner from the case. 
</P>
<P>
Adams faces 330 years in state prison for his convictions of molesting an 
11-year-old San Carlos girl and six girls from Ramona. 
</P>
<P>
Boyle found Adams guilty of 86 lewd and lascivious acts, but found him innocent 
of eight other counts and dismissed two other charges. 
</P>
<P>
Adams will be sentenced Feb. 28.

TOP SAN FERNANDO OFFICIAL TO TAKE BALDWIN PARK JOB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Donald E. Penman, who as San Fernando's city administrator for the past seven 
years was credited with improving public services and revitalizing the city's 
economy, said Wednesday he has agreed to take a similar post in Baldwin Park. 
</P>
<P>
Penman said Baldwin Park officials have offered him the city manager's job. 
"We've pretty much agreed on the terms," he said. "I don't anticipate any 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
"He will be missed," San Fernando Councilman James B. Hansen said. "He has done 
a fine job. This was not a matter of disagreement or a matter of money. It was 
just that he felt he had to go to a larger city to further his career." 
</P>
<P>
Penman, 38, a lifelong San Fernando Valley resident, said he does not plan to 
relocate his family and will commute to the San Gabriel Valley city from his 
Northridge home. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm obviously excited at the prospect of a new challenge, but there's a part 
of me that's sad to be leaving San Fernando," Penman said. "It's been such a 
great experience. Things are going well here. It was a very difficult decision 
to make." 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park Police Chief Carmine Lanza, who is acting city manager, said the 
Baldwin Park City Council will vote on hiring a new city manager on Wednesday. 
The previous city manager, Ralph Webb, resigned last summer under council 
pressure, Lanza said. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Park position pays about $85,000 annually, Lanza said. Penman is 
paid $75,300 in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
Baldwin Park has 195 city employees, almost double the number in San Fernando, 
and about 63,000 residents to San Fernando's 20,000. Like San Fernando, Baldwin 
Park has its own police department but contracts with an outside agency for 
fire protection. 
</P>
<P>
"In the seven years he was with us, the city has identified 41 separate 
projects that he accomplished, from our first major shopping center to 
computerizing City Hall and all of our financial records," Hansen said. 
"There's never a good time to lose a city administrator, but this is a bad time 
for us because we're in the middle of a major redevelopment project." 
</P>
<P>
Hansen was referring to a proposed downtown shopping center, which involves 
negotiations with several property owners. 
</P>
<P>
Penman, who previously was deputy city manager of Simi Valley, said San 
Fernando was in poor financial shape a decade ago. He said council members were 
forced to use $1 million from reserve funds to balance the budget over three 
years, leaving just $1 million in that account. Today, he said, the city has a 
strong economic base and a healthy $3.5-million reserve fund.

MORATORIUM ON SOME CONDO CONSTRUCTION REJECTED IN HAWTHORNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Hawthorne City Council failed Tuesday by a single vote to adopt an 
emergency moratorium on the construction of three or more condominiums on 
single lots in residential zones. 
</P>
<P>
Proposed by Mayor Betty Ainsworth, the 45-day moratorium was designed to give 
the city time to draft new building standards, which would increase parking and 
open space requirements for condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Ainsworth and Councilmen Charles (Chuck) Bookhammer and David M. York voted for 
the moratorium, which needs four votes to pass, and Councilwoman Ginny M. 
Lambert abstained. Councilman Steven Andersen was absent, but he said Wednesday 
that he would favor a moratorium, although he needs to be convinced an 
emergency measure is justified. 
</P>
<P>
The council will get a chance to vote on the issue again next month. Bookhammer 
instructed City Atty. Michael Adamson on Tuesday to place the same ordinance on 
the agenda for the council's reconsideration at its Jan. 8 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
The moratorium was prompted by residents who in November and December 
complained at City Council and Planning Commission meetings about the 
increasing number of large condominium projects that have been built on small 
lots in the city's multiresidential (R3) zones. 
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday's meeting, Lambert agreed that density in condominium 
developments is a problem, but said she feels it is unfair to adopt a 
moratorium without warning developers. She said an emergency moratorium would 
cause great financial hardship to developers who may have invested thousands of 
dollars to plan a project but have yet to obtain a building permit. 
</P>
<P>
If the moratorium had been adopted, the Planning Department would have stopped 
processing all condominium construction plans with three or more units on one 
lot. 
</P>
<P>
Bookhammer and York strongly disagreed with Lambert, saying that, if developers 
are warned about an impending moratorium they will rush to get building permits 
approved before the measure is adopted. 
</P>
<P>
York said a warning would result in a "flood of building permits hitting the 
Building Department (in an attempt) to beat deadline." 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview Wednesday, Andersen said he favors a moratorium that 
would give staff time to study the density problems and draft new building 
standards. But Andersen said he is not convinced that an emergency ordinance is 
justified. He said that, before the council can adopt an emergency ordinance, 
it must prove that "there is an imminent threat to the public's life or 
property." 
</P>
<P>
"That hasn't been proven to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
An emergency ordinance takes effect immediately, but a regular ordinance takes 
longer than a month, said City Manager R. Kenneth Jue. 
</P>
<P>
At the council meeting Tuesday, two South Bay developers whose proposed 
condominium projects would be halted by the proposal, spoke out against a 
moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
Ignacio Aliaga, a Lawndale developer who has submitted plans to build a 
condominium project on Jefferson Avenue, said he has already invested more than 
$2,000 in fees for construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the council to reject the moratorium, saying it would change "all the 
rules of the game." 
</P>
<P>
The minimum lot size for a condominium project is 5,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
Building standards require at least 1,600 square feet of land for every unit 
built on a lot of 5,000 to 15,000 square feet; 1,500 square feet of land for 
every unit built on a lot of 15,000 to 30,000 square feet, and 1,400 square 
feet of land for every unit built on a lot of 30,000 square feet or larger. 
</P>
<P>
Each unit is required to have at least 200 square feet of private open space, 
such as an adjacent patio.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: CHULA VISTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 17-year-old girl was killed early Wednesday in Chula Vista when the car she 
was riding in crashed into the back of a parked truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The accident occurred about 2:55 a.m. when Gretchen Teckmeyer, 19, slammed her 
car into the rear of a one-ton truck that was legally parked in the 600 block 
of Hilltop Drive, a police spokeswoman said. Teckmeyer was treated for facial 
cuts at UC San Diego Medical Center and released, the spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The identity of Teckmeyer's passenger was withheld until her family could be 
notified. It is not known whether the two were wearing seat belts, the 
spokeswoman said.

AMTRAK COMMUTERS BALK AT PARKING FEE IN SAN JUAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Train commuters unhappy about losing free parking spaces to a new, $2-per-day 
garage claimed Wednesday that downtown merchants are gaining customer parking 
at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants claimed just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the commuters have been taking our parking spaces and walking past 
our shops," said Mike Darnold, co-chair of the Downtown Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
City resident Robert Ross, who acts as spokesman for a loosely knit group of 
daily commuters on the well-traveled Amtrak line between San Juan Capistrano 
and Los Angeles, said that a boycott of downtown shops is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said the boycott would be in retaliation for what commuters view as a move 
by city officials to force them to pay for parking. 
</P>
<P>
"The (merchants) around the train station have been making noise that they need 
the additional parking when they really don't," said Ross, a six-year commuter. 
"We figure that if we make an impact on their business, maybe they'll retract 
their request." 
</P>
<P>
Darnold scoffed at the idea that the train riders, with their 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
hours, could affect local trade, which he said is largely dependent on tourist 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very seriously that these people are our customers in the first 
place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most merchants near the train station and Mission San Juan Capistrano for years 
have put extra parking high on their wish lists, Darnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that demand, Community Redevelopment Agency officials made a deal 
with Franciscan Plaza developer Paul Farber to lease 131 spaces in his 
multilevel parking structure for commuters, beginning Jan. 2. The $2 fee -- the 
first of its kind for rail commuters in Orange County -- is being imposed to 
offset costs of maintenance and security. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the 99 free spaces at the lot at the Capistrano Depot will be 
limited to three-hour parking. 
</P>
<P>
For those unable or unwilling to pay the $2 fee, free parking will be provided 
on a dirt lot at the corner of Yorba Street and El Camino Real, about one block 
from the train station, said Jeff Parker, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of calls and letters," Parker said, noting that most people 
complained about how the fee would be charged. A meter accepting eight quarters 
will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Notices about the change were circulated about two weeks ago and came as a 
surprise to most commuters, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said the fee ensures that city taxpayers won't be 
footing the bill for commuters who live in other South Orange County cities and 
park their cars in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters interviewed Wednesday varied in their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very reasonable," said Ronald Barr, who for two years has ridden 
the train to Anaheim. "It would be nice if it was free, but I'd have to support 
the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Others said it wasn't fair to levy charges on a group of people who already are 
paying fares of up to $15 per round trip in an effort to reduce freeway traffic 
and corresponding smog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more nail in the Southern California coffin," Ross said. "This should 
be supported with tourist dollars and people who go to the movies, rather than 
those who are trying to get cars off the road." WENDY PAULSON

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: CABLE TV PACT MAY BE NEGOTIATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cable television may finally be coming to Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Dimension Cable Services, which serves about 20,000 subscribers on the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, has announced that its budget next year includes the costs of 
wiring the three-square-mile community. 
</P>
<P>
However, construction of the system depends on whether Dimension and the city 
reach agreement on a franchise. City Manager Terrence Belanger said 
negotiations will probably begin early next year. 
</P>
<P>
Rolling Hills is the only South Bay city without cable television service. 
Because of its rugged terrain and low density, cable companies have been 
reluctant to invest there. 
</P>
<P>
However, Dimension would have to spend less than other companies to serve 
Rolling Hills because it could use antennas and other equipment already 
installed to serve neighboring communities. 
</P>
<P>
A Dimension spokesman said it could cost twice as much per mile to wire Rolling 
Hills as other cities, and that the company could wind up spending $1 million 
on the job. Whether residents would pay higher subscription fees than those in 
neighboring cities depends on the franchise agreement and other factors, 
another spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Basic cable service costs $18.95 a month in Rancho Palos Verdes. Dimension is a 
subsidiary of Times Mirror Cable Television Inc., a sister company of the Los 
Angeles Times.

DIGEST /LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PLANE CRASH NEAR GORMAN INJURES 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Five people flying from Modesto to San Diego were injured when their 
single-engine Beechcraft airplane lost power about 11 a.m. and crashed near 
Gorman, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
The pilot, Ray Glover, 39, of the Madera County town of Ahwahnee, made an 
emergency landing in rugged terrain near Quail Lake, about one mile north of 
California 138 and two miles east of Interstate 5, said Lt. Ed Chenal of the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department station in Santa Clarita. The plane was 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
Glover walked about a mile from the crash site to a telephone and summoned 
help, Chenal said. The pilot and his passengers -- his wife, Anna Glover, 37; 
their son, Travis Glover, 2; the pilot's sister-in-law Lynn Kelly, 34, and her 
daughter, Kristin, 2, both of Miami -- were taken by helicopter and ambulance 
to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital spokeswoman Susan Mandy said all suffered minor injuries. She would 
not say whether they were being admitted. 
</P>
<P>
The crash is being investigated by the National Transportation Safety Board.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
A Tarzana teen-ager found his 54-year-old father shot to death in their 
apartment Wednesday morning, Los Angeles police reported. There were no 
suspects in the slaying. 
</P>
<P>
Simon Sarkissian, who worked as a baker, was found dead on the living room 
floor of his apartment at 12:10 a.m. when his son, Armin Sarkissian, 19, 
returned home, Detective Rick Swanston said. 
</P>
<P>
The son found the door to the apartment in the 18400 block of Hatteras Street 
closed and there was no sign of a forced entry, Swanston said. Neighbors 
reported hearing a sound that may have been gunfire about 20 minutes before the 
victim was found. 
</P>
<P>
Swanston said there was no evidence that the victim had been robbed. He said 
the shooting appeared to be related to narcotics, but would not elaborate.

LOSSES STEAL HEAT FROM WOULD-BE BARN-BURNERS; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS' FINAL THREE PRESEASON GAMES HAVE 
ONLY A SLIM CHANCE OF LIVING UP TO COACH DAVE YANAI'S EXPECTATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Cal State Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai put together his 1989-90 
basketball schedule, the final three preseason games looked like barn burners. 
</P>
<P>
In the next 10 days the Toros will face perennial NAIA power Biola University 
twice and Quincy College of Illinois, a midwestern Division II threat. 
</P>
<P>
However, the three teams bring a combined 11-23 record into this week's action, 
which begins tonight at 7:30 with Biola (4-9) visiting Cal State Dominguez 
Hills (3-7). 
</P>
<P>
The Toros play host to Quincy (4-6) Tuesday. The Hawks don't figure to do more 
than split their games this week in the Cal State Bakersfield Tournament. If 
Quincy gets by Wisconsin-Oshkosh tonight, it is expected to face the 
high-flying hosts Friday. Bakersfield is 8-1 and riding a seven-game winning 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
The Biola match looked especially interesting. The Eagles hold somewhat of a 
mastery over the Toros, posting a 10-4 series advantage, including a 
season-opening come-from-15-points-behind win over the Toros last season. 
</P>
<P>
Further, the Eagles have considered moving up to the Division II level and held 
preliminary talks last year with the California Collegiate Athletic Assn., of 
which Cal State Dominguez Hills is a member. That added to Biola's rivalry with 
the Toros, as did the fact that both teams run ball control, rebound-oriented 
offenses. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the importance of the home and home series with Biola this year 
(Cal State Dominguez Hills visits Biola Jan. 6) may have lost some of its edge 
when Dave Holmquist did not return as the Eagles' basketball coach. Holmquist 
chose to remain only as the school's athletic director and replaced himself 
with Howard Lyon, the school's former coach who has more than 600 wins in his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
Victories for both Cal State Dominguez Hills and Biola have come sparingly this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
The Toros are coming off a record-setting 107-78 loss at Grand Canyon College. 
The Toros held a 33-21 halftime lead, then allowed the hosts to score 86 
second-half points, the most ever allowed by Cal State Dominguez Hills in a 
half. The 107 is also the most scored against a Cal State Dominguez Hills team. 
In addition, the Antelopes connected on 40 field goals, another record. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai called the game "freakish." He said he had found a silver-lining in the 
loss. 
</P>
<P>
"I was pleased with our showing in the first half," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Like Lyon, Yanai (189-144) is no stranger to winning. But when all but one 
starter graduated from last year's team that went 20-10, he said he knew it 
would take as long as a year for his current group to develop. 
</P>
<P>
"It has been a slow, difficult process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, hinted Yanai two weeks ago following a 78-74 victory over visiting 
North Central Illinois, progress had been too slow. He promised to knuckle down 
in practices and redirect a few players who "are not focused on what we have to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
Since that time, he said, "we have played pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Assistant coach Bart Yamachika has also noticed a different. 
</P>
<P>
"Since (the Illinois game) the team has picked things up." 
</P>
<P>
No one expected the Toros to set the world on fire this season. Cal State 
Dominguez Hills, which starts three freshman, has used its preseason schedule 
in what Yanai has called "baptism by fire." Yanai is pinning most of his hopes 
on sliding into one of the top four spots in the CCAA race, which begins Jan. 
12. That would qualify the Toros for the conference postseason tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point in the season I'm not satisfied, but I am pleased with our 
team's progress," Yanai said. 
</P>
<P>
Junior guard Robert Barksdale, benched by Yanai in a 73-53 loss to West Texas 
State for what the coach termed "poor decisions" in a leadership role, has 
responded in the last three games. He is expected to start at point guard 
against Biola. 
</P>
<P>
"Robert has a responsibility of leadership as the point guard and returning 
player," Yanai said. "At times he was getting caught up in playing at a speed 
in the offense that Barksdale can play at, but the rest of the team can't." 
</P>
<P>
Barksdale leads the team in scoring (19 points a game) and assists (5.5). 
Freshmen Vincent Washington (12.7) and Ray Bennett (10.4), both from Carson 
High School, are the other double-figure scorers for the Toros. 
</P>
<P>
Bennett's play has impressed Yanai. 
</P>
<P>
"He's really surfaced," Yanai said. "He can do some of the things from the 
off-guard spot that will take the pressure off Barksdale." 
</P>
<P>
Norman Francis, the third freshman starter, averages about 21 minutes of 
playing time a game. 
</P>
<P>
Yanai has not settled on a starter for the final forward spot. He says he likes 
the options available. He can start junior Joseph Janney, senior Brian Johnson 
or recently activated sophomore Segaro Bozart. Janney is the quickest of the 
three, but he is playing only his third year of basketball. Johnson is a streak 
shooter who is best from three-point range at the top of the key. Bozart, who 
started last year, has yet to get in total sync with the offense but could be a 
factor in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Segaro has been fine, but he is a little rusty," Yanai said. "He has been 
pressing a bit in his first few games." 
</P>
<P>
Bozart was academically ineligible for the first eight games. 
</P>
<P>
Another possibility would be to start a three-guard offense, with 6-foot-2 
sophomore Michael Bell stepping into the vacant spot. Off the bench, Bell, a 
defensive expert, has averaged 24 minutes of playing time this season, fourth 
on the team behind Barksdale, Washington and Bennett.

NARBONNE HIGH COACH DOESN'T FEEL UNLISTED ANY LONGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Before the season, Narbonne High basketball Coach Bob Hoppes was rarely in 
demand. Then success entered his life. 
</P>
<P>
Now his phone rings at all hours. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one reason I bought the (answering) machine," he said. "I don't want to 
slight anybody. I want to return those calls." 
</P>
<P>
Coaching colleagues call to offer congratulations. Reporters want to know the 
secret behind turning a perennial loser into a winner. 
</P>
<P>
And the Gauchos, who for years played to sparse home crowds, are starting to 
draw a following. 
</P>
<P>
Hoppes, a modest and cautious coach, takes it all in stride. He knows the 
attention will last only as long as the victories outnumber the defeats. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line," he said, "is people want to see wins." 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne fans saw just the opposite last season. The Gauchos finished with a 
3-18 record in Hoppes' second year as coach after suffering an embarrassing 
97-47 loss to top-seeded Manual Arts in the L.A. City Section 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne had no business going to the playoffs after finishing in last place in 
the four-team Pacific League. But L.A. City athletic officials, in their 
infinite wisdom, decided midway through the season that all 4-A teams would 
qualify for postseason play in order to fill out a 16-team bracket. 
</P>
<P>
So, what is usually regarded as a reward, a playoff berth, became a death 
sentence for the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't belong in the playoffs against Manual Arts," Hoppes said. "I had to 
turn around (after the game) and look at the parents and the people who 
supported us all year. That was tough. 
</P>
<P>
"I took a lot of heat. I seriously thought about getting out of (coaching) at 
that point." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately for Narbonne, he decided to give it another try. 
</P>
<P>
With the support of his family and the knowledge that he had a good group of 
athletes coming back, Hoppes went to work after last season. He picked the 
brains of other coaches and he pushed Narbonne through a rigorous schedule of 
summer league games. 
</P>
<P>
The payoff has been a 10-3 start for the Gauchos, who reached the final of the 
Torrance Holiday Classic by beating Torrance on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I've stayed at it," Hoppes said. "I've been busy since I got the job. Some 
people think all you have to do is give the players the ball and let them play. 
After our games, I'm up most of the night thinking about the things that we 
didn't do right. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the biggest factor is that the players believe in themselves and 
believe in what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
Hoppes credits good chemistry for Narbonne's turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos returned two starters -- 6-foot-4 off guard Major Goulsby and 6-7 
forward Curtis Boyer -- and Hoppes blended them with two players off last 
year's league champion junior varsity team -- point guard Gabriel Maciel and 
6-6 center Mike Reynolds. All are seniors. 
</P>
<P>
The fifth starter, 6-3 junior D'Mitri Rideout, was academically ineligible most 
of last season but perhaps has become Narbonne's most exciting player. He has a 
45-inch vertical leap, according to Hoppes, and was named all-tournament two 
weeks ago at the Hamilton Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The first players off the bench for the balanced Gauchos are juniors Vijay 
Mani, an off guard, and forward Robert Jordan, a transfer from Carson. 
</P>
<P>
"Five or six players have scored in double figures most of the season," Hoppes 
said. "We don't really have a star. It's tough for me to single out any one of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
If he had to, though, Hoppes would pick Maciel. 
</P>
<P>
"He's averaging about 16 points and seven or eight assists a game," he said of 
his floor general. "He even does some rebounding. He has an uncanny knack for 
being at the right place at the right time." 
</P>
<P>
Winning has its rewards. For Hoppes, he hopes it can attract the type of 
athlete who has bypassed Narbonne in the past for more successful programs at 
Carson and Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to be (at Narbonne) to understand what's going on," he said. "We have 
some great kids and athletes, but they're not the caliber that are at other 
schools. If a kid checks into the area and is an athlete, he usually wants to 
go to Carson or Banning. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to attract good athletes, we have to win. That's why the season so 
far has been so special." 
</P>
<P>
A promising start would seem to make it easy for Hoppes to aim for lofty goals. 
But in keeping with his conservative personality, his sights for the remainder 
of the season are set on the game at hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in looking past the next one," he said. "I really try to 
instill that in the parents and kids. I want to be realistic." 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne was given a dose a reality last week in a 51-38 loss to Carson, a team 
it will meet twice more in league play. 
</P>
<P>
That indicates the Gauchos still have their work cut out. 
</P>
<P>
And Hoppes still has some sleepless nights ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside's girls basketball team, which lost its first game last week, also 
might have lost a shot at a mythical national championship with a 59-48 setback 
to Brea-Olinda in the Tournament of Champions at Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Frank Scott, though, isn't lamenting the fact that an unbeaten season has 
escaped his team's grasp. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be nice to go undefeated," he said. "But with the schedule we play, 
it's almost unrealistic to think we could go undefeated for a whole season. 
This gives us a chance to see where we are and what we have to do." 
</P>
<P>
Scott said the Lady Monarchs took the loss to Brea-Olinda hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody was down," he said. "We went to the locker room and everyone was 
crying. I told them to get it all out now. It hurts to lose but they have a 
whole season ahead of them." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside played Brea-Olinda without two of its best players. Sophomore 
forward Janet Davis (6-4) was out with a sprained ankle and junior Princess 
Murray, the Lady Monarchs' first player off the bench, was sidelined with a 
dislocated shoulder. Also, 6-5 center Lisa Leslie played only about half the 
game because of foul trouble. 
</P>
<P>
"It hurt us," Scott said. "I'd love to play Brea-Olinda again with a full 
lineup." 
</P>
<P>
PREP NOTES -- Three Mira Costa basketball players received honors last week at 
the Roosevelt Tournament in Honolulu. Guard Chris Hobbs and forward Canyon 
Ceman were named Co-Most Valuable Players and reserve guard Simi Fonoa, who was 
pressed into the starting lineup because of injuries, was selected to the 
all-tournament team. The Mustangs beat David Douglas High of Portland in the 
championship game . . . Morningside, playing this week in the Best of the U.S. 
girls basketball tournament at Shelbyville, Tenn., expected cold weather after 
temperatures near Nashville dipped below zero last week. But Coach Scott 
reported it was 40 degrees Wednesday when the Lady Monarchs opened play . . . 
St. Bernard's Kerrie Peques and Morningside's Santisha Arnold have been invited 
to compete in the girls 500-yard run at the Sunkist Invitational track meet 
Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena.

CHAMINADE TOURNAMENT; 
</P>
<P>
SIMI VALLEY BEATS MARSHALL'S SLOWDOWN, 62-52 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Simi Valley High overcame Marshall's slowdown tactics and Hank Hou's game-high 
31 points to post a 62-52 win Wednesday in pool play in the Chaminade 
basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall (7-5) used a deliberate offense that, at times, left one player at 
midcourt holding the ball. The Barristers waited patiently for a 
high-percentage shot, and the tactic worked for 3 1/2 quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"Our kids got caught up in it, mentally, and they were frustrated," Simi Valley 
Coach Dean Bradshaw said. "They wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley (6-4) began to do that midway through the fourth quarter when the 
Pioneers used a 9-2 run to take a lead they never relinquished. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Jaqua began the spurt with three free throws that gave Simi Valley a 46-45 
lead with 3:44 left. After Hung Diep hit a jump shot to give Marshall a 47-46 
lead with 3:04 left, Simi Valley answered with three consecutive baskets. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny Hood, who finished with 20 points and 11 rebounds, hit a short jump shot 
and Steve Carnes fed Mike Wawryk for two jump shots, giving Simi Valley a 52-47 
lead with 1:52 left. 
</P>
<P>
Marshall pulled to within 54-52 on Mark Umemoto's three-point shot with 48 
seconds left, but Carnes, who had 19 points and seven assists, made a free 
throw and added a three-point play with 22 seconds left that gave Simi Valley 
its biggest lead of the game and allowed Bradshaw a sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
Wawryk added 12 points for Simi Valley, which will play Chatsworth today at 3 
p.m. in a game that will conclude pool play. The winner will advance to the 
championship bracket of the 11-team tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Granada Hills 77, Cathedral 46: Jermoine Brantley scored 12 of his game-high 20 
points to lead a 28-10 third-quarter spurt that gave Granada Hills a 33-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Osiris Nalls and Gene Barshtak scored 11 and 10 points for Granada Hills (6-5), 
which will play Santa Monica tonight at 7:30 for a berth in the championship 
bracket.

IN A HOLDING PATTERN;

<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FORMER CANYON QUARTERBACK KEN SOLLOM TOOK HIS GOLDEN ARM TO 
MICHIGAN WITH HEROIC ASPIRATIONS, BUT THUS FAR HE HAS HAD TO SETTLE FOR AN 
ANONYMOUS ROLE ON SPECIAL TEAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH TOSCHES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anyone who watched quarterback Ken Sollom buzz footballs onto the chests of his 
receivers three years ago at Canyon High will not be surprised to learn that on 
New Year's Day he will don his University of Michigan uniform and march into 
the Rose Bowl prepared to do battle with USC. 
</P>
<P>
As a senior in high school, Sollom passed for 2,720 yards and 28 touchdowns. At 
6-foot-3 and 195 pounds, he is now considerably bigger and stronger than during 
those prep days when his coach said simply, "Ken Sollom has a golden arm." 
</P>
<P>
Days before the Rose Bowl, Sollom must be a proud young man. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes, I'm embarrassed," Sollom said. 
</P>
<P>
He is somewhat sheepish because he no longer stands tall in the pocket and 
sends laser beams downfield with that golden arm. As a matter of fact, his new 
job in football doesn't involve throwing anything. Nor, come to think of it, 
does it even allow him to stand. 
</P>
<P>
In his new role, Sollom lines up behind the center, one knee planted on the 
turf. He takes the snap, just like in the old days, but now he simply takes the 
ball, delicately places one end of it into the grass and puts his right index 
finger atop the other end to prevent the ball from toppling. 
</P>
<P>
Then, teammate J. D. Carlson takes a few quick steps and crushes the ball with 
his foot, missing the fingers at the end of the golden arm by scant 
millimeters. 
</P>
<P>
"When I went to Michigan, I always figured I'd return to play in the Rose 
Bowl," said Sollom, who will be making his second appearance for Michigan in 
that postseason game. "But somehow I always figured it would be as their 
quarterback, not as the holder for the placekicker." 
</P>
<P>
The holder for the kicker? Sollom? The same kid who was, after his brilliant 
senior season in high school, named Golden League Player of the Year and who 
attracted waves of scholarship offers from across the nation? The same kid who 
opened his final high school season by passing for 708 yards and 10 touchdowns 
in just three games? 
</P>
<P>
"It's the same guy," said Canyon Coach Harry Welch, who visited Sollom during a 
Michigan practice in Newport Beach earlier this week. "I watched four very good 
quarterbacks throwing for Michigan at practice, and none of them threw the ball 
as well as I know Kenny Sollom can. He is a beautiful passing machine." 
</P>
<P>
Who is, however, in cold storage. 
</P>
<P>
Sollom, who was wooed heavily by, among others, USC, UCLA, Stanford, Arizona 
and BYU, redshirted as a freshman. Last year he played at quarterback for 
Michigan for brief stints in two games. He completed two of three passes for 13 
yards but played in every game as the holder. 
</P>
<P>
This year, his passing statistics improved dramatically. He completed two of 
three passes for 28 yards. And he was the holder in nearly every kicking 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
He has two years of eligibility remaining, but there are indications that his 
stock as a Michigan quarterback may never rise much above its current value. 
</P>
<P>
The reasons are threefold: Elvis Grbac, Wilbur Odom and Doug Musgrave, fellow 
underclassmen quarterbacks who, in the eyes of the Michigan coaching staff, are 
at least the equal of Sollom. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac, a freshman from Ohio, has vaulted to the head of the list of likely 
successors to senior Michael Taylor. When Taylor went out with a back injury 
after a season-opening loss to Notre Dame, the 6-foot-5 Grbac stepped in and 
led the Wolverines to four consecutive impressive wins. 
</P>
<P>
Grbac is considered to have a virtual lock on Michigan's quarterback job for 
the next three years. And close behind him could be Musgrave, a freshman from 
Colorado who earned consensus All-American honors as a senior, passing for 
3,147 yards and 44 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Sollom might be left to fight it out with Odom -- who will be a senior next 
year -- for the third-string job. 
</P>
<P>
Sollom is confident that he can compete with his three rivals. 
</P>
<P>
"After this year, with Taylor gone, there will be a lot of competition," he 
said. "I figure I'll be right in it." 
</P>
<P>
But the driving ambition to be a roaring collegiate success that he had when he 
left high school seems to have waned. 
</P>
<P>
"If I never become the starting quarterback, it will be a disappointment to 
me," he said. "But I came here because of the college, too, not just for 
football. I'm on my way to getting a communications degree from the University 
of Michigan and that's very important to me now. When I left high school, I 
wasn't thinking about a degree. But now, I see the possibilities." 
</P>
<P>
And so the best quarterback Canyon High has ever seen, and one of the best prep 
quarterbacks California has ever seen, may simply fade away into the real world 
with a communications degree in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
But in the change, his former coach sees a shining example of perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"Kenny could transfer," Welch said. "A lot of schools would kill to get this 
kid. He could whine about what's happened to him at Michigan and just pack up 
and go looking for a different football team. But I'm glad he has decided to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
"So often today we criticize athletes for ignoring their education, and now it 
seems people are putting pressure on Kenny to consider just the opposite. He 
knows he could transfer and play football, but he has said no. He has made a 
commitment to the University of Michigan and he's going to honor it. I admire 
that. It's a breath of fresh air." 
</P>
<P>
And in a collegiate career that has given Sollom just six opportunities to 
crank up the golden arm, he says he still has found highlights. One came early 
this year against UCLA when Carlson, the Michigan kicker, banged a 24-yard 
field goal with one second remaining in the game at the Rose Bowl to give 
Michigan a 24-23 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw a picture of J. D. kicking that field goal," Sollom said. "The ball was 
just leaving the ground. And I said, 'Hey, that's my finger.' " 
</P>
<P>
The young man with the rocket arm smiled. He knows he is capable of more. He 
knows what strength lies coiled in that right arm. And he also knows he might 
never get a chance to unleash it again. 
</P>
<P>
But even though he said he has accepted that possibility, he sometimes wonders 
what went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
"In two years, I might be the starting quarterback in another Rose Bowl," he 
said. "Maybe. Or maybe not. I know now that to get to that point, you have to 
be a lot of things, and one of them is lucky. 
</P>
<P>
"A few years ago I had it all planned: Go to Michigan, star in a few Rose 
Bowls, get drafted by the NFL. I really thought it would be easy. I really 
figured it would just go like that if I was willing to put in the effort. Well, 
I put in the effort. And now, I'm the holder for the placekicker. And I'm 
disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
Some of his biggest supporters from his glory days, however, have not lost any 
of their admiration for him. 
</P>
<P>
"This kid could throw the football like no high school quarterback I have ever 
seen," Welch said. "He was just so gifted. And because of that gift, he got a 
chance to obtain a great education and to meet some really great people. 
</P>
<P>
"If he never again becomes a star in football, it was still that golden arm 
that has allowed him to chase a fuller and richer life. And he has honored his 
commitment to that. For that, I am exceptionally proud of Ken Sollom."

MASTER'S GREER NEEDS TIME TO SCRAPE OFF RUST, POLISH SKILLS AFTER LAYOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At six feet and a lean 165 pounds, The Master's College guard Damon Greer 
appears to be in superb physical shape. 
</P>
<P>
But the former Cleveland High basketball standout, who quit the San Jose State 
team last January in protest of then-Coach Bob Berry's methods, said that he 
was only operating at 70-75% efficiency when he made his debut for Master's 
last week against Cal Baptist. 
</P>
<P>
"It will take me several games until I'm completely back," Greer said after 
scoring six points and handing out four assists. "It will take some time for me 
to get completely comfortable playing with the guys and for them to do likewise 
with me." 
</P>
<P>
Coach Mel Hankinson agreed with Greer's assessment and said that he is 
confident the point guard will come around in plenty of time for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
"When you sit out a year like Damon did, there's always an adjustment, no 
matter what," Hankinson said. "You're always going to feel a little rusty out 
there. But I was very happy with the way he played. 
</P>
<P>
"You could see flashes of what lies ahead for us out there tonight. You could 
see how Damon's skills complement the other players on this team." 
</P>
<P>
Master's (8-6) will play host to Grace College (Ind.) Saturday night at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
On the rise: Two former Valley-area college players were listed as top-10 
prospects of American League West organizations in the recent issue of Baseball 
America magazine. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Appier, a 6-foot-2, 180-pound right-hander from Antelope Valley College, 
is listed as the Kansas City Royals' No. 2 prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Appier, 22, split last season between triple-A ball and the major leagues. He 
was 8-8 with a 3.96 earned-run average in 139 innings at Omaha and 1-4 with a 
9.14 ERA in 22 innings at Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Young, a 6-3, 185-pound right-hander who originally was signed by the 
Dodgers out of Moorpark College, is listed as the Oakland Athletics' No. 4 
prospect. 
</P>
<P>
Young, 25, began the 1989 season with 418 walks in 364 minor-league innings and 
was 3-6 with a 5.45 ERA in the first half. However, he won his last 10 
decisions in the second half at Huntsville in the double-A Southern League, 
compiling a 2.50 ERA in that span and reducing his walks from nine to four per 
game. 
</P>
<P>
Headed for the show: Steve Wapnick, a pitcher from Sepulveda who played at 
Moorpark College and Fresno State, was selected by the Detroit Tigers in the 
major-league draft earlier this month at baseball's Winter Meetings in 
Nashville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick, a 24-year-old right-handed reliever, was left unprotected by the 
Toronto Blue Jays. He was 6-0 with a 1.57 ERA and nine saves last season at 
Class A Dunedin (Fla.), double-A Knoxville and triple-A Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
Wapnick was purchased by the Tigers for $50,000 and placed on the team's 40-man 
roster. 
</P>
<P>
He must make the major-league club out of spring training or be returned to the 
Blue Jays for $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Back on her wheels: A day before the Cal State Northridge women's basketball 
team's first scrimmage last year, freshman Sandi Olson was involved in a 
traffic accident that demolished her 1983 Nissan Sentra and forced her to miss 
the season because of a severe quadriceps laceration. 
</P>
<P>
But a year later, the 6-foot-2 center is second on the team in scoring with a 
9.2 average, including a 23-point performance in her collegiate debut. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Olson recently acquired a new car -- a 1989 Sentra. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't plan on getting the same model," Olson said. "It just turned out that 
way. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not superstitious about it, but I'll definitely be a much safer driver 
now." 
</P>
<P>
No place like home: The CSUN women's basketball team will travel to Sacramento 
State for a game Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
Based on early-season results, however, the Lady Matadors probably would prefer 
to be playing at home. 
</P>
<P>
After an opening win over Cal State Chico on Nov. 17 at the Cal Poly Pomona 
tournament, CSUN (2-10) dropped eight consecutive games -- all on the road -- 
before a convincing win at home over Point Loma. 
</P>
<P>
That victory was followed by two more road losses to Idaho State and Boise 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Visionary: Glendale College guard Bruce Heicke has forsaken his prescription 
goggles from last season and has returned to wearing disposable contact lenses. 
</P>
<P>
Heicke, a sophomore who played at Notre Dame High, began sporting the goggles 
-- which gave him the appearance of a 21st-Century Kurt Rambis -- after he was 
poked in the eye two summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't care how they looked, but they started to hurt me," Heicke said of 
the goggles and the pressure they put on the bridge of his nose. "There's a few 
people who've looked at me and then looked around for the guy wearing goggles. 
</P>
<P>
"Once we start playing, I think they remember me." 
</P>
<P>
There was no doubt about Heicke's identity two weeks ago after he had led the 
Vaqueros to the championship of the Glendale tournament and was named most 
valuable player of the eight-team event. 
</P>
<P>
And last Friday, he made 13 of 14 free throws while scoring a game-high 25 
points in an impressive win over Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Heicke figures to be a marked man this week as Glendale (10-5) travels to San 
Diego to compete in the Palomar tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Recruiting trail: Several Glendale College football players eligible to 
transfer at the semester break in January recently took recruiting trips to 
four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore running backs Sean Hampton and Doug Dragomer visited Utah State and 
Western Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Sophomore wide receiver Pat Lynch visited San Jose State and is expected to 
sign with that school. 
</P>
<P>
Mark MacMillan, an All-State defensive back for the Vaqueros in 1988 who is 
finishing his his two-year degree requirements, is expected to sign with either 
USC or Alabama.

SERRA DEFENSIVE BACK NAMED TO ALL-SOUTHERN SECTION TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Serra High defensive back Clayton Lopez, who helped the Cavaliers to a 14-0 
season and the Southern Section Division VII title, has been chosen to the CIF 
All-Southern Section football team by the Amateur Athletic Foundation board of 
sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
Lopez, a 5-foot-11, 178-pound senior, was one of 25 players selected to the 
elite squad, representing all nine Southern Section divisions. Lopez led Serra 
with eight interceptions and was second on the team in tackles. 
</P>
<P>
He was one of only two players on the team from a Division VII school. The 
other was Lompoc running back Napoleon Kaufman, the division MVP. Serra edged 
Lompoc in the championship game, 34-31. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop Montgomery lineman Chris Maumalanga was the only South Bay player named 
to the All-Division I team. The 6-4, 320-pound senior led the Knights with 86 
tackles and nine sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Bobby Sylvester of division champion Fontana and tailback Ron Rivers 
of runner-up San Gorgonio were selected Division I Co-Players of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
The South Bay was well-represented on the All-Division II squad with eight 
selections, two each from Bay League teams Palos Verdes, Hawthorne, Leuzinger 
and Rolling Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Named to the offensive unit were running backs Chris Alexander of Hawthorne and 
Robert Coulter of Rolling Hills, lineman Jim Justice and place-kicker Angel 
Andrade of Leuzinger and Palos Verdes quarterback Blake Anderson, chosen as an 
all-purpose player for his additional skill as a kick returner. 
</P>

<P>
It was a classic match-up, a battle of undefeated cross-town rivals, Southern 
Section against City, private school meets public. 
</P>
<P>
The contest was surprisingly one-sided, however, as San Fernando High recorded 
a convincing 4-1 win over Alemany in a first-round match of the Hart boys' 
tournament Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Alemany (4-1-1) trailed, 2-0, before trimming the margin toward the end of the 
first half when forward Damon Rivetti, flanked by San Fernando's Tereseso 
Delgado and Ricardo Coyt, flicked the ball into the upper-left corner of the 
net from 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando (5-0-2) took a 3-1 lead 15 minutes into the second half on Enrique 
Moreno's shot from three yards. Two minutes later, Jaime Ballesteros dribbled 
between three Alemany defenders and fired a shot from 10 yards into the left 
side of the net for a 4-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round matches: 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Camarillo High won the Ventura tournament in 1983, but getting past the first 
round of late has been a struggle for the Scorpions. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, Camarillo was upset by lowly Oxnard in the first round and Wednesday 
night, in another first-round game at Ventura High, tiny Nordhoff took the 
Scorpions to the limit before succumbing to center Fred Tepesano's three-point 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Camarillo came from behind to win, 77-71. 
</P>
<P>
Nordhoff (6-4), coming off a tournament championship at Fillmore last week, had 
opened a 60-47 lead heading into the fourth quarter and had thoroughly 
frustrated Camarillo (8-2) until Tepesano found his range. 
</P>
<P>
Tepesano made four three-point shots in the first 4 minutes, 30 seconds of the 
quarter to pull the Scorpions into a 65-65 tie. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded baskets for the next two minutes before guard David Harbour's 
three-point shot with 2:05 left gave the Scorpions a 72-71 lead they would not 
relinquish. Camarillo kept the Rangers out of the lane down the stretch, 
forcing them to take three-point attempts that would not fall. 
</P>
<P>
Tepesano scored a team-high 25 points and Harbour added 24 points and 10 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Oxnard 63, Channel Islands 59 (3 OTs) -- Guard Rubin Bryant scored four of his 
game-high 16 points in the third overtime period as the Yellowjackets (5-5) 
outscored the Raiders, 7-3, to pull off a mild upset. 
</P>
<P>
Newbury Park 62, Ventura 50 -- Center Kevin Loveall scored 14 points and Tim 
Lane came off the bench to add 14 for Newbury Park (6-3), which will play 
Oxnard in a quarterfinal game at 8 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Buena 102, Thousand Oaks 91 -- Jeff Oliver scored a game-high 36 points and 
Darren Shearer added 20 to lead the defending tournament-champion Bulldogs 
(5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Thousand Oaks (4-5) was led by forward Chris Loll with 33 points. PAUL 
OLSONEAGLE ROCK TOURNAMENT Taft 68, Eagle Rock 67 (OT) -- James Yoakum's 
five-foot jump shot and free throw with three seconds left in overtime brought 
the Toreadors back from a 19-point third-quarter deficit in a quarterfinal 
game. Yoakum finished with 18 points and sophomore guard Casey Sheahan had 20, 
including a 17-foot jump shot that tied the score, 59-59, with six seconds left 
in regulation. Jason Deyoe scored 16 points and grabbed nine rebounds for Taft 
(9-2), which will play Locke today in the semifinals. Sylmar 91, Garfield 78 
(OT) -- Sylmar rallied from a 14-point halftime deficit and hammered Garfield, 
17-4, in overtime in a second-round consolation game at Eagle Rock. Donovan 
Walker, one of three players who scored a game-high 19 points, had seven in 
overtime for the Spartans (5-5).BIRMINGHAM TOURNAMENT Kennedy 68, Poly 51 -- 
Senior guard Garret Anderson scored a game-high 33 points and teammate Josh 
Ettings added 21 to lead the Golden Cougars in the first round. Reseda 78,

the Regents (3-4) in a first-round game. Marcus Reed scored a 22 points for 
Canoga Park.LAS VEGAS VALLEY TOURNAMENT Carson 82, Royal 65 -- A pair of 
standout football players sparked Carson to a 31-9 lead after one quarter in a 
first-round game. All-American linebacker Nkosi Littleton scored 15 points and

Jared Byrne scored a career-high 23 points for the Highlanders (8-3) and 
teammate Russell Myers -- making his first start in six games -- scored 20.LAS 
VEGAS ELDORADO TOURNAMENT San Fernando 85, Las Vegas 66 -- Led by Russell 
Baldwin with 24 points, five San Fernando players scored in double figures as 
the Tigers (6-1) advanced to the semifinals. Baldwin, a 6-4 center, also pulled

his team trailing by 16 at halftime, Village Christian's John Brown scored 15 
of his game-high 29 points in the third quarter to bring the Crusaders to

COMPUTER FILE: HOME, WORK COMPUTERS CAN TALK WITH EASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID, LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer 
analyst and writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A lot of people who use a personal computer at the office have yet to buy one 
for their homes. In many cases, they're looking for a machine that's compatible 
with the office machine so that they can bring work home at night. 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, getting a home computer that's compatible with the one at the 
office is not as difficult as it may seem. In today's computing environment, 
there are ways for just about anything to share data with anything else. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of businesses invest in expensive industrial strength computers with fast 
central processing units, or CPUs, and high-capacity hard disks. In most cases, 
businesses use machines that are IBM compatible, although a growing number of 
companies are using at least some Apple Macintosh systems. 
</P>
<P>
In either case, it's possible to get an inexpensive home system that can, at 
the very least, use the same data files as the one at the office. It's even 
possible to use IBM-compatible data disks with some models of the Apple 
Macintosh and specially equipped versions of the Commodore Amiga, Atari ST and 
Apple II. 
</P>
<P>
You can now get fully equipped IBM compatible machines for under $1,000. Such 
machines can, in most cases, run the same software and access the same data 
disks as the more expensive PCs at the office. Yet there are a few programs 
that require a system with an Intel 80286 or 80386 CPU and cannot be run on a 
low-cost machine equipped with a less powerful CPU. Some programs require that 
your machine be equipped with a hard disk. If you don't already have one, a 
hard disk can be added for as little as $250. 
</P>
<P>
It is important to be sure that both your home and office machines have the 
same type of disk drives. Most machines use 5 1/4-inch disks, but some, 
including laptops and IBM PS/2 models, use 3 1/2-inch disks. Whatever drive 
your system has, you can add the other type. Desktop machines can be equipped 
with a 3 1/2-inch drive for as little as $90 (plus labor for those who aren't 
inclined to install it themselves). 
</P>
<P>
Even if the machines don't have the same disk format, it's possible to transfer 
data by connecting two machines with a cable. That's practical if one of the 
machines is portable or if you're transferring lots of files between machines 
at your office. 
</P>
<P>
LapLink III, from Traveling Software, (800) 343-8080, and FastWire, from Rupp 
Bros., (212) 517-7775, are software programs that come with cables that allow 
you to connect just about any two IBM compatibles via their serial or parallel 
ports. These programs can transfer one or many files with a single command. 
</P>
<P>
With both of these programs you'll have to reach around the machines to plug in 
your cables. Another option is to get File Shuttle from GetC Software, (800) 
663-8066. The program comes with an ingenious little adapter, called the 
"Rocket Socket," that connects your laptop directly to your parallel printer 
cable. If the back of your printer is accessible, connecting the two machines 
couldn't be easier. You just unplug the cable from the printer and connect it 
to one side of the Rocket Socket. The socket's other side plugs directly into 
the parallel port of your laptop. The software is very easy to use, and data is 
transferred very quickly -- up to 3 megabytes a minute. 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to run the same software at home and work just to use the same 
data files. Most word processing programs can store and read data saved as 
standard text files. Such files can be moved easily between programs. Even 
spreadsheet and database management programs are able to exchange data via 
various standard formats. If you do wind up with incompatible files, there are 
a number of programs designed to make the translation. 
</P>
<P>
Software Bridge, from Systems Compatibility Corp., (800) 333-1395, is a $149 
program that translates files between a number of word processing programs. And 
don't worry if your office uses Lotus 1-2-3 and you use VP Planner, Quattro, 
Excel or some other spreadsheet program at home. Virtually all spreadsheet 
programs can read and write files from 1-2-3. 
</P>
<P>
Most people with IBM-compatible PCs at the office feel that they have to buy an 
IBM compatible for the home. That does make it easier to move data back and 
forth, but it isn't absolutely necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Unless equipped with special hardware or software, the Apple Macintosh cannot 
run the same programs as the IBM. However, it can exchange data files. All new 
Macs come with Apple's "SuperDrive" that can read and write 3 1/2-inch IBM 
diskettes. As it comes from Apple, it's necessary to use some cumbersome 
software to access MS-DOS diskettes. If you're using MS-DOS disks on a regular 
basis, it's worth an extra $89.95 (suggested retail) to purchase DOS Mounter 
from Dayna Communications, (801) 531-0600. This handy program fools the Mac 
into treating the MS-DOS disk exactly as though it were a Mac disk, making it a 
lot easier to load and save data. 
</P>
<P>
Most Mac spreadsheet programs can read Lotus 1-2-3 files, and all Mac word 
processing programs can access standard IBM text files. MacLink Plus from 
DataViz, (203) 268-0030, can translate files between popular IBM and Mac 
programs. If you often switch between a Mac and a PC, you might consider using 
programs (such as Microsoft Word, WordPerfect and Excel) that offer versions 
for both machines and use data files from their counterparts on the other 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
The Atari ST, Apple II and Commodore Amiga can also be equipped to read IBM 
data disks and to run IBM software. The Atari ST uses the same file format as 
the IBM PC, so it's able to read and write 3 1/2-inch MS-DOS data disks. 
</P>
<P>
It's also possible to run IBM software on any of these machines by purchasing 
special hardware or software that allow them to emulate an IBM PC. However, if 
your goal is to run IBM software, you're generally better off buying an IBM 
compatible.

SAN DIEGO ARCHITECTURE IN THE EIGHTIES; 
</P>
<P>
CITY IS POISED FOR GREAT THINGS ARCHITECTURALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Most architects seem to agree that the last decade was more of a painful 
adolescence than a graceful maturing. But many lessons learned during the past 
10 years have advanced San Diego's architectural scene to the point where the 
city appears poised for great things in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Most observers are hard-pressed to name any landmark buildings put up in the 
past 10 years, and only one may stand the test of time: the new San Diego 
Convention Center, architect Arthur Erickson's masterpiece of concrete 
geometries. 
</P>
<P>
But if there weren't many outstanding buildings for a city that recently became 
the nation's sixth largest, there were other milestones. 
</P>
<P>
As the decade began, former Mayor Pete Wilson led the way toward developing a 
new downtown core. Its transformation from a place with little retail activity 
and virtually no residential base to an urban center that incorporates both, as 
well as the awesome pace of development elsewhere in the city, often proceeded 
too quickly for the good of architecture. 
</P>
<P>
Horton Plaza evolved from a mall with many street-level openings to a closed-in 
design. This has proven successful 
</P>
<P>
commercially but less viable as a tool aimed at revitalizing nearby streets. 
And architect Jon Jerde's Disneyland-ish takeoff on postmodernism is bound to 
look dated in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Downtown, the Centre City Development Corp. struggled to create a mechanism by 
which significant new projects could evolve with input not only from their 
architects and developers, but also from city planners, community groups, 
economic consultants and politicians. 
</P>
<P>
The Courtyard, a 40-story apartment tower for a site at Front and G streets, 
typified this struggle. Three development proposals were sent back for 
revamping, and Johnson Fain &amp; Pereira Associates of Los Angeles replaced 
San Diego architect Rob Quigley on the team that eventually won the job. 
</P>
<P>
Their proposed design seems good in terms of human scale and local context, but 
the confusion of the drawn-out CCDC process may have scared off developers and 
architects from future opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
Context, and the question of whether there could ever be a regional 
architecture here, continued to perplex San Diego architects. 
</P>
<P>
Some are starting to realize that "context" doesn't necessarily mean borrowing 
from Balboa Park's towers and domes, or lifting architectural elements from 
nearby buildings. 
</P>
<P>
It's a good sign that architects are finding more subtle ways of addressing the 
climate and life style of the area as well as the specific needs of building 
users. 
</P>
<P>
The increased quality of large projects, both public and private, was a 
countywide trend in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
New civic center designs in Oceanside and Escondido proved that excellent 
architecture can happen when architects listen to a variety of comments and 
carefully consider site and context. 
</P>
<P>
Behind both civic centers are design competitions that attracted entries from 
large and small architectural firms and forums that gave the public ample 
opportunity to submit their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
Public awareness of architecture increased immensely during the decade. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego Home/Garden magazine is thriving after 10 years in business, with the 
best of local home design as a significant portion of its contents. 
</P>
<P>
The local chapter of the American Institute of Architects honors the best and 
worst of local architecture as selected by a jury that includes several 
non-architects. Started in 1976, the Orchids &amp; Onions program came of age 
in the '80s. This year, more than 1,000 people attended the awards event at 
Symphony Hall. While it may be argued whether the program takes architecture 
seriously enough, it gets people talking about architecture, and that is good. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego's largest firms went through a decade of transition. With the city's 
rapid growth, many enjoyed tremendous business success, and, by the mid-'80s, 
were turning out designs at breakneck speed. Their staffs expanded accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
However, as the decade came to a close, some firms saw a need to either scale 
back their operations for the sake of quality control, or to revamp them, 
</P>
<P>
putting more emphasis on design. 
</P>
<P>
"We had 110 people, but we decided that to do the sizes of projects we wanted 
to do, a staff of 70 to 85 would be best," said Gordon Carrier, president of 
BSHA. He admitted that design quality had slipped. "We made a conscious effort 
to scale back. I think it has to do with giving more personal service, and 
realizing that good design comes from being able to control what's going on 
more." 
</P>
<P>
San Diego architects, at large and small shops, were faced with a wave of 
out-of-town competition in the late '80s. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Graves (The Aventine in La Jolla), Arthur Erickson, Moore Ruble Yudell 
(Escondido and Oceanside civic centers), Helmut Jahn (Great American Plaza 
downtown), Robert Stern (Prospect Point), Robert Venturi (La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art expansion), and Skidmore Owings &amp; Merrill (Symphony 
Towers) designed projects here for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
While many showed little regard for their setting (most notably Jahn, Graves 
and SOM), MRY and Erickson, in particular, gave fresh design responses. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the new preponderance of projects by name architects put local 
developers and architects on notice that the level of design sophistication has 
reached a new high in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
If the '80s belonged to any one local architect, it was Rob Quigley. His 
attempts to break new ground did not always satisfy everyone, or even the 
architect himself, but Quigley single-handedly did more creative work than any 
local rival. His accomplishments were validated by awards from the local AIA. 
In his best year, 1985, he walked away with an unprecedented five out of 17 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
Quigley's work is reaching a mature phase. His Linda Vista Library, with its 
energetic forms, thoughtful interior layout, use of light and inventive 
combinations of materials is one of his best designs yet. 
</P>
<P>
His maturity is symbolic of a trend during the '80s, a decade in which 
postermodernism bloomed and withered in the space of a few years. The 
movement's intent -- to return richness and warmth to architecture after years 
of sterile modernism -- was valid, but it lacked in execution. 
</P>
<P>
While the excessive frills are vanishing, what remains is a new concern for 
detailing and people-oriented designs. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the swan song for postmodernism in San Diego is superstar architect 
Michael Graves' design of The Aventine in La Jolla. Love it or hate it, this 
magnificent office-hotel complex at Interstate 5 and La Jolla Village Drive is 
one of the architect's best works, and it sets a new standard for detailing and 
quality of materials. 
</P>
<P>
A strong educational scene helps upgrade the architecture of any city. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State University offers an environmental design program. The New 
School of Architecture opened in 1981, and moved downtown in 1988. UC San Diego 
is about to name a dean for a new architecture school, which was launched 
earlier this year with an daylong symposium featuring architectural demigods 
Ricardo Legorreta, Richard Meier, Richard Rogers and Fumihiko Maki. 
</P>
<P>
Probably nothing sums up the increased interest in architecture at decade's end 
better than that symposium. Mandeville Auditorium was packed.

MAGAZINES: LAST WORDS ON 'END OF HISTORY,' DEATH OF NOVELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB SIPCHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
So far, the best magazine reading for the New Year looks to be the spillover of 
debate on a couple of 1989's hottest intellectual (pseudo-intellectual?) 
issues: Francis Fukuyama's "End of History?" essay in the National Interest, 
and Tom Wolfe's alarum about the state of the American novel in Harper's 
Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
The winter issue of the National Interest contains a reply by Fukuyama to the 
thundering horde of critics that savaged his daring theory. 
</P>
<P>
Readers may recall the battle. In the summer National Interest, Fukuyama (who 
had been an anonymous State Department planner before his thesis made him a D. 
C. celebrity of sorts) argued that Gorbachev's glasnost may well prove that 
Western liberal democracy has now triumphed to such an extent that history -- 
at least ideologically driven history, as defined by the 18th Century 
philosopher Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel -- is soon to become a thing of the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
In the same issue, National Interest gave several pundits room to respond to 
Fukuyama, but the ensuing battle could not be contained, and quickly spilled 
over into newspapers, news weeklies, and other publications here and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
Now Fukuyama writes that the real accomplishment of his essay was "to produce a 
uniquely universal consensus, not on the current status of liberalism, but on 
the fact that I was wrong and that history has not in fact ended." 
</P>
<P>
Fukuyama's response is good-humored, although he is unable to contain his 
disdain for the critics he feels misread -- or failed to read -- his original 
thesis. Most of his energy is spent peeling through these "layers of 
misunderstanding." 
</P>
<P>
In the first round of debate, Fukuyama asserted that one of his primary goals 
in writing the essay was to make people think about problems the 
democratic-egalitarian trend carries with it. 
</P>
<P>
He addresses some of those in the new essay, most eloquently the issue of how 
those who have democracy will define and live "the good life" it affords -- 
"The vacuum that constitutes our freedom can be filled with anything: sloth and 
self-indulgence as well as moderation and courage, desire for wealth and 
preoccupation with commercial gain as well as love of reflection and pursuit of 
beauty, banality alongside spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
In the fall, when the endless blather about the end of history began to fade, 
the November issue of Harper's arrived to fill the vacuum with an essay by a 
better known cultural rabble-rouser -- Tom Wolfe. In his "manifesto," entitled 
"Stalking the Billion-Footed Beast," Wolfe argues that at least since the late 
1950s, American novelists have been blundering about under the spell of 
avant-garde theorists, ignoring the higher calling of realism. 
</P>
<P>
The response from literary America, as reflected in a draft selection of 
letters scheduled to appear in next February's Harper's, is -- at least by the 
standards of the circumspect literati -- almost as unified in its condemnation 
as was the response to Fukuyama. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, Philip Roth, author of "Portnoy's Complaint," chastises Wolfe for 
failing to grasp or for misrepresenting an essay he wrote, in 1961, about 
novelists turning away from grand realistic themes. That Wolfe portrayed him as 
having "turned a whole generation against realism," Roth writes, "strikes me, 
frankly, as nuts." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the authors argue for an ecumenical approach to fiction writing, one 
that embraces all variety of styles and world views. Jim Harrison, author of 
"Dalva" (1988) and "Sundog" (1984), writes that Wolfe's essay reminded him that 
"reality is consensual, and that part of growing up is accepting different 
worlds: my mother's, my lawyer's, Dan Quayle's and now Tom Wolfe's, with a 
thousand others intermixed." 
</P>
<P>
But novelist Richard Bausch offers the clearest perspective on Wolfe's essay -- 
as well as the ensuing debate. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not all sociologists, nor are we supposed to be," he asserts. "This sort 
of stuff is fine for cocktail parties and boozy late night talk, but finally 
it's just not all that important. The stories will keep getting written and 
told, and they'll be whatever they are, and the generations will remember some 
of them." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Zoo Life Joins Flock of Wildlife Magazines 
</P>
<P>
Nature lovers can take comfort in the fact that even as the number of animal 
species on the Earth diminishes, the small flock of magazines devoted to 
wildlife in the wild remains robust. They should also take comfort, however, 
from the premiere issue of a slick, general interest quarterly devoted to 
wildlife in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
Zoo Life, published by the Ingle Publishing Co. in Los Angeles, in association 
with the American Assn. of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, is a clearly 
partisan magazine dedicated to the conservation and captive breeding programs 
that help preserve endangered species, and to the "fun and sense of wonder that 
zoological parks inspire." 
</P>
<P>
Among the well-balanced articles in the first issue is an essay on the 
conservation role that zoos play as "the Noah's Arks of the 20th Century"; a 
feature on the Los Angeles Zoo's new Adventure Island; and such interesting 
tidbits as a recipe for anteater chow (one pound commercial bird of prey diet 
mix, one scoop dog chow, two tablespoons yogurt, two peeled oranges, one peeled 
avocado and one pound of cottage cheese). 
</P>
<P>
Zoos have revolutionized their approach to the public in the last several 
years, putting their educational product in as entertaining a package as 
amusement parks put their thrills. Zoo Life follows suit. 
</P>
<P>
Without sacrificing the message, the magazine is easy to read and graphically 
beautiful. The photography is excellent. And $2 from each subscription is 
contributed to whatever zoo the reader designates. 
</P>
<P>
(Zoo Life, $9.95 a year, P.O. Box 886, Farmingdale, NY 11737-9786.)

Glasnost Embraces Tools of Democracy 
</P>
<P>
The tragedy of the emerging post-Cold War countries, cynics have observed, is 
that they are destined to learn their primary lessons about democracy from the 
U.S. electoral process. A worrisome article in the New Republic for Jan. 8-15 
details how certain institutions of democracy the Founding Fathers never 
envisioned -- public relations firms, lobbyists, and political consultants -- 
have made their move on Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The piece focuses, for example, on Frank Mankiewicz, a PR executive who 
previously handled press relations for Robert Kennedy and served as George 
McGovern's campaign manager. Like other enterprising Americans, Mankiewicz saw 
big opportunity in the budding freedom of the Eastern Bloc. Now he has a job 
polishing the image of the Hungarian Socialist Party, whose public approval 
rating in Hungary is reportedly 3%.

Food for Thought: A former cook at a restaurant owned by rock 'n' roll legend 
Chuck Berry has accused the guitarist of videotaping her while she used the 
restroom at the Missouri establishment. Hosana Huck filed a lawsuit against 
Berry, 63, in St. Charles County Circuit Court. She was a cook at the Southern 
Air Restaurant in Wentzville, about 35 miles northwest of St. Louis. The suit 
claims that the musician-restaurateur "intentionally and without just cause or 
excuse intruded upon (Huck's) seclusion and privacy without her permission by 
surreptitiously making or manufacturing videotapes" depicting her in 
embarrassing states. Berry could not be reached for comment.

* Hair o' the Pup: Weaver Kim Mikel, 28, of Walled Lake, Mich., says she plans 
to make her next fashion item from the fur of her pet Afghan dog, Oliver. 
Mikel's yarn is usually made from the fur of Angora rabbits that she and her 
husband, Jim, raise in their barn. She also experiments with combinations of 
sheep's wool, mohair, cotton and soon, the hair of the dog. Before long "It 
will be chic" to wear something made from your own pet's fur, she says. 
</P>
<P>
* Clothes Conscious: Former Billionaire Boys Club leader Joe Hunt, convicted in 
one murder and acting as his own attorney against charges in another, says he 
likes being in court. Hunt, who is charged with murder, kidnapping and 
conspiracy in the death of Hedayat Eslaminia, a wealthy Belmont, Calif., 
resident who was once an adviser to the Shah of Iran, told the press in Redwood 
City, Calif., that he almost believes he is a free man when he walks into court 
dressed in an expensive tailored suit to argue pre-trial motions. "I'm in a 
suit and wearing something other than a Jack La Lanne jumpsuit. I can forget 
about spending most of my time in a cage," Hunt said. Outside of the time he 
spends in court, Hunt is confined to a maximum-security jail cell. BETTIJANE

MISS MANNERS: CASH GIFTS TO BOSS ARE IMPROPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- The boss was given $100 each by two married men. She is 
married, and she took it for a Christmas present. 
</P>
<P>
I say no married man with any morals would consider doing this, especially if 
he thought anything of home and family. And no married woman with morals would 
accept a gift of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
So that means the two men were without morals to offer it, and she had no 
morals in taking it. 
</P>
<P>
I think it was tasteless and rude. One of the wives is thinking of divorcing 
her husband over it. It's full of trouble for all three parties. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners hopes that you are not the wife thinking of 
divorcing her husband, and that you will discourage any such action in cases of 
which you know. The situation you describe is trouble, all right, but it's not 
that much trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Presents to one's boss are inappropriate from any employee. Money given in a 
working situation at the end of the year is called a Christmas bonus, and it is 
properly given by a boss to employees. 
</P>
<P>
To violate this practice may be foolish or subservient, but it is not immoral. 
And who is married and what anybody thinks of his family has nothing whatever 
to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR MISS MANNERS -- My husband and I were invited to a Christmas party, with 
an "open house" invitation of the kind that you buy at a stationery store. It 
did not indicate the proper form of dress. We are all professional people in 
our early 30s. 
</P>
<P>
We arrived at this party in casual dress (my husband was without a jacket or 
tie and in deck shoes, and I was in slacks and a sweater) and were surprised to 
find ourselves at a dressy and catered affair. Many of the male guests were in 
tuxedos, and the rest were in jacket and tie. The women were all in holiday 
dresses. 
</P>
<P>
It was obvious when we arrived that the hostess was not pleased with our dress. 
We spent the first half-hour wondering when we could leave. Finally we 
retreated to the kitchen until we felt it appropriate to excuse ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
When I saw the hostess at work afterward, I thanked her and said that we 
thought it would be a more casual affair, otherwise we would have dressed more 
appropriately. She responded, "Oh, well, we had a little bit of everything." I 
thought this response was flippant. 
</P>
<P>
This experience leaves us wondering what went wrong and hoping that it will 
never happen again. We feel that hosts have a responsibility to inform their 
guests, either directly or through the tone of the invitation, if the dress is 
to be anything but casual. 
</P>
<P>
GENTLE READER -- While it is true that hosts are supposed to indicate what 
dress will be appropriate to their parties, Miss Manners is not going to 
exonerate you as thoroughly as you are prepared to exonerate yourself. 
</P>
<P>
Among adults, standard dress is business attire, unless you are informed -- or 
know, from intimacy with the hosts' habits -- otherwise. That is what you 
should have worn. The men in tuxedos were every bit as wrong in their dress as 
you were. 
</P>
<P>
But why do you object to your hostess being cheerfully flippant after the fact? 
Her comment, generalizing the error and trivializing it, seems to Miss Manners 
to have been in the right tone. Would you have preferred "Next time you'll know 
better"?

DR. JOYCE BROTHERS: A LOAN COULD HELP BOYFRIEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: I recently inherited money and would like to lend some to a 
boyfriend who's starting up his own company. My only worry is that, if I do 
this, something might happen and it would end up hurting our relationship. I 
know he needs the money, but some guys can't stand taking anything from a 
woman. If I do give it to him, how should I do it? -- F.E. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR F.E.: The more businesslike you can be about the loan, the less chance 
there will be for misunderstanding later, in case he can't repay you. There's 
an old saying that you should never lend money you can't afford to lose. Always 
assume that the loan might go sour. If it does, you might be able to deduct the 
debt as a "short-term capital loss" on your tax return as long as you have 
proof. 
</P>
<P>
If you're seriously involved with this man, don't hesitate to discuss your 
feelings about the loan with him. Find out how he feels before you write out 
any checks. 
</P>
<P>
If you do decide to make the loan, by all means don't give it in cash, and make 
it clear that all repayment should also be by check so you both have a record. 
Formalize your agreement; the more casual you are about lending, the more 
likely the exchange will impinge on your friendship. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR DR. BROTHERS: My husband was very poor when he was a young man and he's 
determined to see that his two children have everything they wish. Even though 
they are 8 and 12, they have their own credit cards, and they don't hesitate to 
use them. I feel it isn't fair to them to let them grow up thinking that they 
will always have whatever they want. We're not that rich, and someday they're 
going to have a rude awakening. -- D.S. 
</P>
<P>
DEAR D.S.: Children need allowances because this is a way of teaching them how 
to save for special things that cost more than they can afford. Parents who 
don't give youngsters allowances are robbing them and giving them an 
unrealistic view of what money is and what it can do. 
</P>
<P>
Parents who give children too much never allow them to learn the true value of 
money. It's vital for youngsters to find that you can't have everything you 
want when you want it. 
</P>
<P>
Children need to learn about delayed gratification. Allowances help them to 
postpone gratification and also gives them a necessary sense of independence. 
They learn by making mistakes, and if they choose unwisely, they may have to go 
without for a few weeks and this impresses them, making their next choices 
wiser and more deliberate. If a child is simply given a credit card, he won't 
learn this and will have to pay dearly later in life.

DEAR DIARY,; 
</P>
<P>
ADOLESCENCE: THE COMING OF A NEW YEAR IS A TRADITIONAL TIME TO BEGIN KEEPING A 
RECORD OF EACH DAY'S HOPES AND FEARS, TRIUMPHS AND TRAGEDIES. THE WRITER 
USUALLY IS A YOUNG GIRL, AND THE SUBJECT OFTEN IS BOYS.

<P>
Jill Cohen is a senior in high school, far removed from her first 
post-pubescent anxieties. SATs have replaced boys -- temporarily at least -- on 
her priority list. 
</P>
<P>
But on her nightstand remains a carry-over from her early teen-age years, her 
most precious tool for self-discovery. Her diary. 
</P>
<P>
"It's out there every day, where it's always been," said Cohen, of Granada 
Hills. "After all these years, it's still important to me. I wouldn't want 
anyone to read it." 
</P>
<P>
Teen-agers -- especially girls -- are known for their slavish devotion to daily 
diaries, cataloguing their experience in explicit detail before it escapes 
memory. And while VCRs, CDs and MTV continue to redefine the adolescent life 
style of the '80s and '90s, the day of the diary is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, companies have been making diaries for decades and do especially brisk 
business during the Christmas season. Although diaries do not necessarily 
contain 365 pages, one for each day of the year, the beginning of a new year 
frequently triggers an urge to keep a journal. 
</P>
<P>
Michael DeMent, a spokesman for Hallmark Cards, which produces 12 kinds of 
diaries -- varying mostly in graphic design -- said they have grown in 
popularity. He said diaries, together with albums and other memory books, 
annually make up a $500-million industry. Each Hallmark diary is 188 pages long 
and doesn't have dates and years so teen-agers won't feel obligated to make 
daily entries. 
</P>
<P>
"Teen-agers are registering the need to chronicle what's going on with them and 
their families," DeMent said. "We're not sure why, but the number bought goes 
up each year." 
</P>
<P>
A diary allows Tamara Bell, 17, to create a new world. Bell, of Granada Hills, 
has poured her thoughts into her journal almost every day since ninth grade. 
Life in the San Fernando Valley isn't always so rosy, she says, but the diary 
takes care of that. When she is writing, she transplants herself to a time and 
place where she imagines she is prettier and more sophisticated -- where she 
always gets the guy of her dreams. 
</P>
<P>
"It's where I can play pretend," Bell said. "I can live how I want to live. I 
have all these romances, and they're always at the beach. In the diary, I just 
know the guy's going to be mine. In real life, it's 'don't you touch me at 
all.' " 
</P>
<P>
Bell said she writes extensively about her family, especially her mother. "I 
write about how different we are and yet how similar we are." 
</P>
<P>
Bell's cousin, Tonya Bell, 16, is also a diary die-hard. She releases her 
deepest, innermost thoughts about her newest crush, and what she wants to come 
from it. Like most teen-agers, she is understandably protective of her journal. 
She keeps it in a jewelry box and hides it in her bottom drawer under some 
boxes and clothes. 
</P>
<P>
That's not all. She has developed an intricate code to hide certain identities 
in case the book were to land in the hands of the wrong parties. Even close 
friends aren't granted reading rights. "So even if someone finds it," Tonya 
said, "they wouldn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
All of the Hallmark diaries feature locks. "We feel teen-agers want to guard 
what's there just like it's their lockers at school," DeMent said. 
</P>
<P>
But do their thoughts become so guarded, so private, that the diary prevents 
them from confronting real problems with friends and family? Illisa Kessler, 
17, of Granada Hills recalled a friend who became dangerously immersed in her 
written world. "She'd write in her book and not tell anyone anything. She 
doesn't go out any more. We were the best of friends." 
</P>
<P>
Sharon Haber, a family counselor in Woodland Hills, said some teen-agers could 
get carried away but believes diaries are healthful outlets. "It might even 
encourage them to go to their family and friends because writing it down allows 
them to get more in touch with their feelings. And if they don't go to their 
families, it's not the diary that's going to push them further away." 
</P>
<P>
Darla Livingston, 16, of Granada Hills said diaries have helped bring her 
family together. She said her mother, 54, has shown her the diary she put 
together when she was a teen-ager. "I only remember my mom being old. But she 
was actually like me. I can relate more to her now when she's trying to help me 
with my problems." 
</P>
<P>
Yet even Livingston has her limits. She doesn't let her mom know too much. The 
diary isn't nearly as explicit as conversations with friends. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk with my mom about boys, but if I wrote it in the diary and she saw 
it," Livingston said, "she'd burn the book or she'd burn me." 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, diaries aren't popular with teen-age males. DeMent said the 
company estimates that 90% of the items in the "social expression industry" -- 
anything purchased in a card store -- are bought by women. Glebb Gofin, 17, of 
Granada Hills seems to represent the general male perspective. 
</P>
<P>
"You should be able to remember your feelings without writing them down," Gofin 
said. "I remember my first love, my first kiss." 
</P>
<P>
(Replied a female teen-age friend: "That was a dream.") 
</P>
<P>
Over the years, as adolescence evolves into adulthood, the diary can serve as 
nostalgia, a reminder of junior high indiscretions. 
</P>
<P>
"I look back now, and I can't believe some of the things I wrote," said Singe 
Jung, 18, of Northridge, a freshman at UC Riverside. "I'd write, 'Oh, I love 
him. I want his kids.' And then a few weeks later, I'd see what a jerk some guy 
was." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Jung writes in her diary every day, sometimes for a few hours. She 
finished one book -- they typically run about 150-200 pages -- in eight months, 
and is almost finished with another. 
</P>
<P>
A recent entry: 
</P>
<P>
 "I met this new guy in psychology today. I forgot his name. I think it was Rob 
or Robert. He's a psych-bio major. That's a pretty interesting major. He was 
really nice but nice guys can't be trusted."

Sly Sues: Sylvester Stallone has sued an art broker for $5 million, claiming 
she led him to pay millions of dollars more than he should have for several 
artworks. The fraud and breach-of-contract suit, filed Tuesday in Los Angeles 
Superior Court, charges that New York-based art consultant Barbara Guggenheim 
persuaded Stallone to pay $1.8 million for a painting she told him was an 
excellent investment. After buying it sight unseen, the star of the "Rocky" and 
"Rambo" movies said he discovered that it was damaged, 25% to 30% of it had 
been restored or retouched and that its previous owner had tried for some time 
to sell it. The suit also charges that Stallone believes he paid too much for 
several other works bought through Guggenheim. CLAUDIA PUIG

A PURPOSEFUL, PERSONABLE BARRY MANILOW AT UNIVERSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL GREIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Explaining the genesis of his mostly autobiographical show on Tuesday at the 
Universal Amphitheatre, Barry Manilow quoted John F. Kennedy: "We can't know 
where we're going until we know where we've been." 
</P>
<P>
While invoking the words of a President to summarize the intention of a pop 
concert smacks of self-importance, it signaled a sense of purpose for Manilow's 
concert. 
</P>
<P>
Though the show -- which had a successful run on Broadway earlier this year -- 
was essentially the same one that Manilow has given the last couple of times he 
played Los Angeles, it seemed more focused. And it fulfilled its mandate of 
showing us the forces that shaped Manilow, including a teen-age preference for 
jazz over Top 40 that contributed to his not fitting in. In this specific, 
highly personal context, the rueful "All the Time" -- Manilow's 1976 ballad 
that is his finest song -- was especially poignant. 
</P>
<P>
It would have been nice if the show had featured more intimate, revealing 
moments like that, but Manilow is first and foremost a showman, so ballads were 
downplayed in favor of applause-generating shtick. 
</P>
<P>
And what did the newer songs say about where Manilow is going? Encouragingly, 
the focus on subtle, fluid ballads like "Keep Each Other Warm" and the smoky, 
jazz-shaded "Brooklyn Blues" showed that Manilow is trying to break the 
build-to-crescendo mold that characterized most of his '70s hits. 
</P>
<P>
The I-made-it-and-you-can-make-it-too nature of the show's story line carried a 
whiff of self-congratulation, but Tuesday's concert (the first of six nights) 
succeeded on the strength of Manilow's music and his disarming personality.

A BALANCED ACT BY THE PSYCHEDELIC FURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Over the past decade, the Psychedelic Furs have alternated between churning up 
sandstorms of dense, distorted sound and laying down winsome pop with gentle 
surfaces and enticing melodies. The British band has made memorable music doing 
it both ways, and on Tuesday at the Celebrity Theatre in Anaheim it did justice 
to each approach. 
</P>
<P>
Some admirers of the Furs' earlier, noisier incarnation tend to discredit the 
pop fluency that evolved by the group's third album, "Forever Now." Now, with 
its new album, "Book of Days," the band has returned to the sonic maelstrom 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
The first half of the show was devoted primarily to songs from the new album, 
and to older material, such as "Sister Europe," that also featured opaque, 
layered sound. The six Furs rendered those textures effectively, but before 
long a sense of droning sameness set in, and one began to wonder whether the 
Furs were going to repudiate their pop tendencies and linger in murk for an 
entire show. 
</P>
<P>
Then, like a beam shooting through clouds, "Heaven" came shining with its firm, 
clear melodic and rhythmic surge. It was the first in a troika of romantic pop 
songs that gave the show a needed lift around the halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
The Furs also play Friday and Saturday at the Pantages Theatre. MIKE BOEHM

AN AFFECTIONATE PROFILE OF MILOS FORMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHEILA BENSON, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The hourlong profile of Czech-born director Milos Forman that is part of the 
PBS "American Masters" series (KCET Channel 28 tonight at 8) is urbane and 
affectionate. It contains clips from his droll Czech films and his major 
American ones: "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," "Amadeus," "Hair," "Ragtime" 
and "Valmont" -- the latter while it was still being shot. 
</P>
<P>
Unsurprisingly, you do not hear a discouraging word from any of Forman's stars 
or from such associates as his cinematographer, his longtime screenwriter or 
his agent, something of a legend himself. If the program also works as a 
behind-the-scenes promotional trailer for "Valmont," well, it's an intriguing 
project to eavesdrop upon. 
</P>
<P>
The only drawback to such a generous viewpoint is that it doesn't probe very 
deeply -- if at all. There might have been a chance of that, since the film 
maker is Forman's own mentor at the Czech film school in the 1950s, Vojtech 
Jasny, but if there was any notion of revealing the drive that kept Forman 
going during his lean early years in the United States, it's long since 
abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
Born in 1932, Forman tells a haunting story about his last view of his 
teacher-father who, like his mother, perished at the hands of the Nazis in 
World War II. The 8-year-old Milos was called out of class one day because his 
father had -- unexpectedly -- come to see him. Putting his hand on his son's 
head and giving him a message to tell his mother that he loved her, his father 
left, flanked by the two men in long brown leather coats who had accompanied 
him. The boy cheerfully ran home to pass on the loving message, oblivious of 
the meaning of the scene. A year later, his mother too was seized. 
</P>
<P>
As Forman elaborates on the influences that formed his early droll Czech 
successes "Loves of a Blonde" and "Fireman's Ball," the film provides clips 
from those treasures. Later, when Forman explains that his first American film, 
"Taking Off" was a flop, carrying as it did the young director's hopes of big 
American success, you hope for some critical balance, someone knowledgeable 
recruited to point out that it was only a flop financially, but that it was 
well-loved critically and almost a cult film now. In fact, some of its 
stylistic innovations are used to this day: "Taking Off's" delicious audition 
sequence was duplicated in no less recent a success than "The Fabulous Baker 
Boys." But the mainstream -- box-office -- view is the only one given any 
weight. 
</P>
<P>
In written articles about those early days, Forman himself has detailed his 
awful period after "Taking Off," but you won't learn about them here. He seems 
to float from success to success with the ease of Danielle Steele moving from 
tome to tome. Even the piquant sentence by his agent, Robbie Lanz, underlining 
the fact that Forman had completely assimilated himself into the United States, 
in the process jettisoning a nationality, a language and a family, goes 
uninvestigated. That could hardly have been a move without consequence, psychic 
or otherwise, but we get only a wealth of anecdote to bury the pain -- if 
indeed there was any. 
</P>
<P>
The most penetrating view of Forman at work, even rivaling the one of his 
distinguished co-screenwriter, Jean-Claude Carriere, comes from character actor 
Vincent Schiavelli, part of the Forman repertory family since his role as the 
dope-smoking instructor in "Taking Off." Having worked repeatedly with Forman, 
Schiavelli observes that his talent with actors is that the director "puts 
himself at the center of conflict of a scene." Therefore, in "Valmont," he is 
restrained, gentle and elegant. But in "Cuckoo's Nest," his comments were 
pointed, unsettling, couched in language that matched the film's; he would 
begin a criticism with "You're crazy!" "He really put everything off-center and 
put everyone ill-at-ease; he became Big Nurse at the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
Wreathed in cigar smoke in his handsome library, in anecdote after anecdote 
that he is happy to tell on himself, Forman emerges as a deceptively open man, 
cultured and wide-ranging. Since these glimpses of his working life are so 
tantalizing, it's no wonder we want to do more than scratch the uncomplicated 
surface this film provides of an obviously complicated personality.

YOU ASKED ABOUT: NUTRITION INFORMATION ON FRENCH GOAT CHEESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: A question in your column about feta cheese brought to mind a similar 
one I have with regard to French goat cheese, or fromage chevre -- the type 
that comes in logs. I have heard that it is low in calories, but the creamy 
texture tells me otherwise. Can you obtain the nutritive information on this 
product? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: There are some differences between varieties, according to Arnaud 
Brassier of Couturier USA, Inc., a French company that produces French-style 
fresh goat cheese near Fennimore, Wis. Each one-ounce serving of regular 
Couturier chevre contains 80 calories, 5 grams fat, 6 grams protein, 26 
milligrams cholesterol and 93 milligrams sodium. Couturier Light contains 52 
calories, 3 grams fat, 6 grams protein, 14 milligrams cholesterol and 93 
milligrams sodium. 
</P>
<P>
Q: Why do some recipes tell you to mix ingredients with a wooden spoon? Does it 
make a difference? 
</P>
<P>
A: We looked into this question several years ago and found there were several 
practical reasons for using wooden utensils, according to "The Cook's Store" 
(Fireside Books/Simon &amp; Schuster: 1978) by the editors of Consumer Guide. 
Wooden spoons are softer than metal and won't scratch or damage cookware. 
</P>
<P>
Because wood is a poor conductor of heat, wooden utensils don't get hot and 
fingers won't be burned. In addition, they won't discolor delicate sauces or 
leave any metallic taste behind. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Williams-Sonoma Cookbook" (Random House, 1986), author Chuck Williams 
says that wood absorbs some flavors from food and recommends keeping separately 
identified tools for special uses. This ensures that the garlic in yesterday's 
pasta sauce doesn't end up in tomorrow's custard. 
</P>
<P>
Williams suggests cleaning wooden tools with a damp cloth or rinsing quickly 
under running hot water. He warns against soaking the tools in water or putting 
them in the dishwasher -- the natural oil will dry out and the wood will absorb 
detergents. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I would like to know how to make yogurt. I know you can buy yogurt machines, 
but can it be prepared without any special equipment? 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes, by following this recipe from "Better Homes and Gardens Golden Treasury 
of Cooking" (Meredith Corp., 1973): 
</P>
<P>
HOMEMADE YOGURT 
</P>
<P>
2 cups skim milk 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons plain yogurt 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup crushed fresh or frozen fruit, optional 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons sugar, optional 
</P>
<P>
Heat skim milk to 200 degrees. Cool to 115 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Place yogurt in mixing bowl. Blend in warm milk. Remove 2 tablespoons mixture 
and place in custard cup to use in place of plain yogurt as starter for next 
recipe. 
</P>
<P>
Add fruit and sugar to mixture in bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and towel. 
Place bowl in larger bowl of 115 degree water. Let stand until yogurt is firm 
when shaken gently, 6 to 8 hours for plain, 3 to 5 hours for fruited. 
</P>
<P>
Change water occasionally, keeping temperature constant at about 115 degrees. 
Chill yogurt and starter. Makes 2 cups.

BACK TO BASICS: HOW TO FORM LOAVES FOR BAKING YEAST BREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We close 1989 with the last in a series of columns explaining how to bake yeast 
bread. Preparing, kneading and proofing the basic dough have been covered, as 
has one method of shaping it into a loaf by rolling and folding. 
</P>
<P>
In a similar technique, the dough is formed into a 14x8-inch rectangle, then 
rolled in a tight scroll beginning with the short end. Pinch the seam closed, 
seal the ends and fold them under. Place, seam side down, in a greased pan. 
</P>
<P>
Bread dough may also be free-formed into a loaf by gently pulling the top 
surface toward the underside to make the top smooth. Pinch the seam and turn 
the ends under (Step 1). Place, seam side down, in a greased pan (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
Free-form round loaves (Step 3) are prepared in the same manner. To encourage 
them to rise rather than spread, place in round cake pans or loosely encircle 
each loaf with a band of one-inch-high foil. Remove the foil after the bread 
has risen about halfway. 
</P>
<P>
No matter the method used, the loaves should then be covered with a towel and 
allowed to rise until doubled before baking. 
</P>
<P>
A previous column discussed the effect baking pans have on bread crust. So does 
brushing the dough with various ingredients before, during or after baking: 
</P>
<P>
* A whole egg or egg white beaten with a little water and brushed onto the 
dough just before baking produces a shiny crust. 
</P>
<P>
* Milk brushed onto bread gives a slightly soft or tender crust with a somewhat 
dull shine. 
</P>
<P>
* Water brushed or lightly sprayed on baking loaves results in a crisp crust. 
Placing a pan of hot water on the shelf below the bread during baking creates 
steam and produces an even crisper crust. 
</P>
<P>
Breads should be baked in a preheated oven. When done, they will appear to have 
pulled away from the sides of the pan (Step 4) and should slip out easily. 
</P>
<P>
Test for doneness by tapping the bottom crust sharply with your fingers. If 
fully baked it will have a hollow sound. If not, replace in the pan and return 
to the oven for another five to 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
After baking, remove bread from the pans immediately and place loaves on their 
side on wire racks to cool. Butter or margarine brushed on freshly baked loaves 
(Step 5) helps tenderize the crust. 
</P>
<P>
Bread wrapped in a clean towel or loose plastic may be stored one to two days 
at room temperature. Wrapping breads tightly causes them to mold. For longer 
storage, freeze bread wrapped in foil and placed in plastic bags. Date and use 
within three months.

DEAR SOS: I am requesting your assistance in obtaining a recipe for Steak 
Diane, as it is prepared at many fine restaurants. -- JOE 
</P>
<P>
DEAR JOE: Steak Diane was -- and is -- in the repertory of classic dishes 
prepared table side at fine restaurants. It's a wonderful dish with which to 
show off at your dinner table for two, (a New Year's tete-a-tete, perhaps?). 
</P>

If you are squeamish about flaming a dish at the table, prepare and dish it up 
it in the kitchen. The effect will not be the same, however. 
</P>
<P>
STEAK DIANE 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup butter or margarine 
</P>
<P>
1/4 cup minced shallots or green onions 
</P>

</P>
<P>
1/4 cup brandy 
</P>
<P>
Melt butter, then add shallots and cook until tender, but not browned. Add 
Worcestershire, bouillon, salt and pepper. Bring to boil, and cook until liquid 
is reduced by about half. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, pan broil steaks until rare or done as desired. Transfer meat 
drippings to chafing dish or leave in skillet. If using chafing dish, add 
steaks to drippings and turn to coat well. 
</P>
<P>
Warm brandy. Pour over steaks, heat sauce and ignite. Let flames die down and 
serve at once. Makes 2 servings.

COOK IT LIGHT: NEW PIE CRUST RECIPE TAKES CARE OF PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNE JONES, Jones is a food consultant and a cookbook author.

<P>
DEAR JEANNE: I have a recipe for a perfect pie crust. It makes several crusts 
and can be frozen. Is there any way to lower the fat and cholesterol but still 
keep the same idea? I don't make pies that often so I would settle for just 
some improvement in the recipe. Would you be interested in trying it? -- P.J., 
Downers Grove, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
PERFECT PIE CRUST 
</P>
<P>
4 cups flour 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
2 teaspoons salt 
</P>
<P>
1 3/4 cups shortening 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup water 
</P>
<P>
1 tablespoon vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 egg 
</P>
<P>
Place flour, sugar and salt in large bowl and mix well with fork. Add 
shortening and mix with fork until ingredients are crumbly. 
</P>
<P>
Beat together water, vinegar and egg in small bowl. Add to flour mixture, 
stirring with fork until all ingredients are moistened. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough in 5 portions. Shape each portion with hands into flat round patty 
ready for rolling. Wrap each in plastic or wax paper and chill at least 1/2 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to roll pie crust, lightly flour both sides of patty. Place on 
lightly floured board or pastry cloth. Cover rolling pin with stocking and rub 
in small amount of flour. Keeping pastry round, roll from center to 1/8-inch 
thickness and 2 inches larger than inverted pie pan. 
</P>
<P>
Fold in halves or quarters. Transfer to pie pan, unfold and fit loosely in pan. 
Press with fingers to remove air pockets. Trim overhanging edge of pastry about 
3/4 inch from rim of pan, fold under and flute pastry with fingers or press 
firmly around edge of pan with tines of fork, dipped in flour occasionally to 
prevent sticking. 
</P>
<P>
Fill and bake as desired in individual recipe. (For baked pie shell, pierce 
bottom and sides of pastry with tines of table fork. Bake on rack in center of 
oven at 450 degrees 12 to 15 minutes or until golden brown. Cool on cake rack, 
then fill as desired.) 
</P>
<P>
DEAR P.J.: This pie crust recipe is indeed foolproof. Unfortunately, the 
ingredients that assure its flaky texture and ease of handling are also the 
very ones you want to reduce. After several attempts, I think I have come up 
with an acceptably flaky and lower-calorie and lower-cholesterol pie crust. 
</P>
<P>
You will notice that I have reduced the yield from five crusts to two, so you 
don't have to make so much of it at any one time. Also, my revised crust should 
not be handled more than is necessary or it will become tough. In this regard 
it is not quite as perfect as the original, yet it does solve your problem 
perfectly. -- JEANNE 
</P>
<P>
PIE CRUST 
</P>
<P>
2 cups unbleached flour 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
1/2 cup cold corn-oil margarine 
</P>
<P>
1 1/2 teaspoons vinegar 
</P>
<P>
1 egg white 
</P>
<P>
2 tablespoons ice water 
</P>
<P>
Place flour, sugar and salt in large bowl and mix well with table fork. Add 
margarine and mix with fork until ingredients are crumbly. 
</P>
<P>
Beat together vinegar and egg white with fork in small bowl. Add to flour 
mixture and stir until all ingredients are moistened. Add water, 1 tablespoon 
at time, stirring until dough forms pieces size of dimes. 
</P>
<P>
Divide dough into 2 portions and shape each portion with hands into flat round 
patty ready for rolling. Wrap each in plastic or wax paper and chill at least 
1/2 hour before rolling. 
</P>
<P>
When ready to roll pie crust, lightly flour both sides of patty. Place on 
lightly floured board or pastry cloth. Cover rolling pin with stocking and rub 
in small amount of flour. Keeping pastry round, roll from center to 1/8-inch 
thickness and 2 inches larger than inverted pie pan. 
</P>
<P>
Fold in halves or quarters. Transfer to pie pan, unfold and fit loosely in pan. 
Press with fingers to remove air pockets. Trim overhanging edge of pastry about 
3/4 inch from rim of pan, fold under and flute pastry with fingers or press 
firmly around edge of pan with tines of fork, dipped in flour occasionally to 
prevent sticking. 
</P>
<P>
For baked pie shell, pierce bottom and sides of pastry with tines of table 
fork. Bake on rack in center of oven at 450 degrees 10 to 12 minutes or until 
golden brown. Cool on cake rack, then fill as desired.

CAMPUS FACES OPPOSITION DESPITE CSU'S WARNING; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FRUSTRATED BY ENVIRONMENTALISTS' OBJECTIONS TO CAL STATE'S PROPOSED 
TAYLOR RANCH CENTER, CHANCELLOR W. ANN REYNOLDS IS DEMANDING AN OUTPOURING OF 
LOCAL SUPPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the wake of a demand for support by California State University Chancellor 
W. Ann Reynolds, some groups are forming to mount a campaign for a Cal State 
campus at Taylor Ranch in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
But those opposed to the university site were not moved by an ultimatum issued 
by Reynolds. 
</P>
<P>
In a series of meetings last week with local civic leaders, Reynolds and her 
top aide, Vice Chancellor Jack Smart, said the university would drop its plans 
for expansion in Ventura County without a firm show of support for the site, 
which has been criticized on environmental grounds. 
</P>
<P>
"We have done an exhaustive search for sites," she said. "Now we need an 
outpouring of community support. We need to be loved a little." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds said she wants to see that outpouring, in the form of letters to Cal 
State trustees and local elected officials, as well as other demonstrations of 
community backing, in the next six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, a 35-member group calling itself the Victory Alliance and another 
group called Save the University have organized to raise funds for a 
professional public relations campaign, said Jim Salzer, a local businessman 
who is an emerging leader of the movement. The campaign would aim to persuade 
elected officials and the public that the university would offer more benefits 
than problems, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our politicians are running scared," said Salzer. "They have all been hesitant 
to take a stand because of the seemingly awesome ability of one local business, 
Yvon Chouinard and Patagonia, to marshal support for anti-growth issues." 
</P>
<P>
Chouinard, whose outdoor-clothing and mountaineering gear companies employ 
about 500 people, helped elect three no-growth candidates to the Ventura City 
Council last month. Those council members continue to express serious 
reservations about a Cal State campus at Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"I come down on the side of the preservation of Ventura over a university," 
said council member Cathy Bean. "I think of Ventura as the jewel of the county 
and I see no reason to take it and crush it in the dust." 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County Supervisor Susan Lacey, whose district includes the city of 
Ventura and the Taylor Ranch, affirmed her support of a university in the 
county, but stopped short of endorsing Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
"Without the environmental impact report," she said, "you do not have the 
information upon which to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
However, without evidence of community support there will be no further study, 
Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not even going to go ahead with the second EIR unless we get a strong 
sense that the community wants this university first," Reynolds said at a 
reception last week at the Cal State Northridge, Ventura campus. 
</P>
<P>
When the university performed its first EIR for Taylor Ranch, the study looked 
only at the impact of a two-year center. A court order now requires an expanded 
report that would study the impact of a full, four-year university. 
</P>
<P>
Joyce Kennedy, director of the two-year Cal State center in Ventura, called 
Reynolds' decision to stop the site discussions reasonable. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot plow the same territory over and over again in terms of searching 
for sites," she said. "We've had 15 years to think about the university in 
terms of the needs of the county." 
</P>
<P>
The university chose Taylor Ranch after a years-long search. It first bought 
land in the county in 1979 in the Somis area. At that time, the state decided 
the county did not need a full university and sold the land. It left a two-year 
program, which offers upper-division classes for bachelors' and advanced 
degrees in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
The new campus would educate the equivalent of about 15,000 full-time students, 
most of them from Ventura County, Reynolds said. Its hillside location would 
limit its size, she added. 
</P>
<P>
A smaller school of 8,000 students advocated by some would not provide what 
Reynolds called the "critical mass" necessary to a university. Degrees in 
disciplines like business administration and environmental studies would be 
unavailable, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The university is negotiating with Santa Barbara heiress Cynthia Wood and other 
family members for 465 acres at Taylor Ranch, which the Wood family owns. The 
property likely will be condemned in what university officials are describing 
as a "friendly" procedure. 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to assuage some environmental concerns, the university plans to 
buy an additional 300 acres owned by members of the August Ferro family just 
west of the Taylor Ranch. The property would provide a buffer between the 
fragile estuary of the Ventura River and the activities of the university, 
Reynolds said. Now cultivated for avocados, it could be returned to its natural 
state, or be used for a park, she said. 
</P>
<P>
That makes the proposition more attractive, said Kevin Sweeney, public affairs 
director for Patagonia. 
</P>
<P>
"But once you build on the other side of the river, it will bring more 
development," he said. Patagonia contends the university "did a poor job of 
site selection." 
</P>
<P>
Newly elected Ventura City Councilman Todd Collart, a former planning 
commissioner who was also elected on the Patagonia anti-growth slate, said a 
completed EIR is essential to decide whether to support the Taylor Ranch site. 
</P>
<P>
"Water is the biggest stumbling block," Collart said. "You can deal with 
housing and traffic problems, but if you don't have water, you don't have 
water." 
</P>
<P>
If residents or elected officials do support the Taylor Ranch site before the 
EIR is completed, Collart said it would amount to a "hollow commitment." 
</P>
<P>
Everett Millais, director of community development for the city of Ventura, 
said the university will likely look outside the city for water sources. The 
city could now support a small two-year campus, he said, but not a 
15,000-student campus, even if it took 30 years to reach that point. 
</P>
<P>
If a larger campus were built, he said, additional water might be yielded from 
new wells on the site, a contract with the Casitas Water District, or the 
purchase of water rights belonging to Shell Oil Co., which leases the mineral 
rights on the Taylor Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
Campus supporters hope such issues won't derail the university permanently. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be an educational and a cultural and economic resource that would be 
unmatched in the history of Ventura County," said Julius Gius, a university 
supporter who is the retired editor of the Ventura County Star-Free Press. "The 
time for commitment by the people who believe we should have a university has 
come. They have got to let their feelings be known."

MYSTERY, ROMANCE FLOW FROM LEGENDARY KITCHEN ABANDONED 28 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SZYMANSKI, Michael Szymanski is a free-lance writer who lives in 
West Hollywood. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Chairs are stacked on the tables. Toothpicks and silverware are set out. Red 
and white checkered tablecloths are folded up next to menus waiting to be 
passed out to patrons. It has been that way for 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
The Original Spanish Kitchen, a popular restaurant for nearly three decades at 
7373 Beverly Blvd., closed abruptly in 1961 and has been the source of mystery 
and rumor ever since. Television shows have labeled it haunted. A "Lou Grant" 
episode based a murder mystery on the shuttered restaurant. Magazine stories 
tell of a shoot-out that took place inside. 
</P>
<P>
Wonderful legends all -- but none of them true. The truth is that this decaying 
building has simply frozen in time a moment of happier days in a love story of 
an elderly woman who has shut herself off from the world, much like her 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
There are a few undisputed facts: In the summer of 1961, the owner locked the 
doors, put up a "Closed for Vacation" sign, placed salt shakers and napkins on 
each table and never opened the restaurant again. Today, a peek through the 
broken, rose-glazed windows shows the silverware laid out under cobwebbed 
chandeliers and faded paintings of caballeros hanging above two dusty ice 
boxes. 
</P>
<P>
"The building sits there like a ghost of a human tragedy," said Rick Rosen, a 
Los Angeles historian who, over the years, has heard most of the tales. "People 
have been fascinated by it for decades," said Rosen, who, until recently, 
worked for the Los Angeles Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
One version of the legend, Rosen said, is that the restaurant represented the 
lifelong dream of a young couple, but it never opened because the husband was 
murdered inside and the wife, who has since died, asked in her will that the 
restaurant be left undisturbed until the killer was caught. 
</P>
<P>
Such tales are fueled in part by the family's unwillingness to speak about the 
restaurant and by the reclusiveness of the founder's wife, Pearl Caretto, who 
is very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl and Johnny Caretto's dream was to open a branch of the Original Spanish 
Kitchen in downtown Los Angeles, which opened in 1926 with Johnny Caretto as a 
partner. When the doors of the Westside restaurant opened in 1932, it became an 
instant success. Deluxe dinners cost $1.25. Johnny was always there -- often 
showing Mexican-born cook Frank Acuna his secret recipes at the grill behind 
the bar. Merrill Cozzens, who worked there as a waiter from the day it opened 
until it closed nearly three decades later, remembers it all. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a fancy place, but it wasn't a diner," Cozzens, 79, recalled in a 
recent interview. "People came because Johnny made them feel at home. Big stars 
of the day -- Bob Hope, Van Johnson, Buster Keaton, Howard Keel, Linda Darnell 
and John and Lionel Barrymore -- made it their regular hangout. 
</P>
<P>
"Mary Pickford had her special booth in a corner by the door, and she was 
always friendly to anyone who asked for autographs," said Cozzens, who is now 
retired and lives with his wife, Frances, in Burbank. "Sometimes she'd hand 
Johnny a recipe and he'd add it to the menu." 
</P>
<P>
No shoot-out ever happened at the restaurant, Cozzens insisted. The most 
dramatic incident he could recall was when two Los Angeles police detectives 
decided to duke it out in the back alley. They left their guns on the bar, and 
a dishwasher stole both guns and fled to Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cozzens recalled that he met his future wife at the restaurant and that Caretto 
gave him extra time off for a honeymoon. "He knew about true love. He was very 
devoted to Pearl," Cozzens said. 
</P>
<P>
The Carettos lived upstairs in an apartment. Pearl Caretto was a dancer. 
Cozzens recalled that she would come downstairs and greet guests and watch 
Johnny at the grill for hours. 
</P>
<P>
And so the restaurant thrived for 27 years. But then Johnny was diagnosed with 
Parkinson's disease. Pearl closed the Original Spanish Kitchen to take care of 
him, expecting he would return soon. He died in 1967 in a rest home. 
</P>
<P>
Pearl never reopened the restaurant. Neighborhood business owners said she 
lived upstairs for years, depending on them to bring her food and medicine. 
They would leave packages at the door. She would see no one. In 1980, the 
building was vandalized, and she moved. 
</P>
<P>
"She just wants to be left alone," said Caretto's daughter, Pat Arnold of Sun 
Lakes, Ariz. "It's her property, it's her life. She asked me never to talk 
about the restaurant to anyone, and I've kept that promise all my life." 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Caretto is listed as the sole owner of the property, and she pays taxes 
on it every year. One real estate broker, Guy Doeh of West Los Angeles Realty, 
estimates the 4,000-square-foot building and the lot it occupies are worth at 
least $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Brian Bobrosky, who owns the upholstery shop next door, said he has agreed to 
board up broken windows and chase away vandals for the quiet woman he has known 
since he was a child. He said he is asked an average of twice a week about the 
closed restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like keeping an old Buick in your back yard," Bobrosky said. "Some people 
say it should be fixed, some people say you should sell it. Whose business is 
it? If you want it to sit there and rust, that's your choice. That's her 
choice." 
</P>
<P>
The neon sign on the front of the building is broken. The balcony hanging over 
the front archway is rusting. The outside is papered with movie posters, and 
the pillars are splattered with cryptic graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
Although he acknowledged that it is not a historic building in any conventional 
sense, historian Rosen said he hopes a way might be found to leave the 
restaurant undisturbed. "If you restore this building, it loses the poignant 
reason that makes it so interesting," he said. "It's a personal heartache that 
is displayed publicly, a moment in time that has been captured. Every time I 
pass it, I'm glad it's still there." 
</P>
<P>
Pearl Caretto now lives in an apartment in another part of Los Angeles. Her 
hair is white, her skin smooth, and she still has the dazzling blue eyes 
remembered by past patrons. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been 10 years since a reporter has found me," she said to the visitor at 
her door one day recently. She then answered questions for more than an hour 
through her barred window. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm really not what they say, you know, a hermit and all. It's just hard for 
me to talk about that, even now." 
</P>
<P>
Caretto chatted about the importance of eyesight, crime in Los Angeles and the 
Dodgers. She never watches television but listens to the radio and reads the 
paper. She talked about caring for one person -- always. 
</P>
<P>
"There isn't much love in marriage these days, is there?" she asked distantly. 
"There's so much divorce. Isn't it sad how so many people never find their one 
true love? And always, always it ends in heartbreak, you'll see." 
</P>
<P>
Was she talking about her and Johnny? She wouldn't say. 
</P>
<P>
"I-I don't want to be pestered any more," she said. "There is no mystery in 
that place. I'd just as soon bulldoze it down and be done with it." 
</P>
<P>
Yet, at the place now called the "Old" Spanish Kitchen, the grill is ready to 
be fired, but customers will never know the magical recipes that died with 
Johnny Caretto. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no story here," Pearl Caretto said. 
</P>
<P>
But she smiled as she closed her window. "Maybe someday I'll write a book."

OCCIDENTAL COLLEGE WEIGHS ACQUISITION OF HISTORIC ARGUS COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Occidental College in Eagle Rock is exploring the purchase of a historic, but 
currently dilapidated, bungalow court on Colorado Boulevard for off-campus 
faculty housing, officials said last week. 
</P>
<P>
Carl Vance, vice president of business and finance for the liberal arts 
college, said the 16-unit Argus Court is of interest as part of an initiative 
by the college's new president to extend ties to the surrounding community. 
</P>
<P>
The 65-year-old Tudor-style court at 1760 Colorado Blvd. was one of three 
Northeast Los Angeles structures designated last week as historic cultural 
monuments by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Also receiving the designation in a council vote Wednesday were two houses in 
the 4200 block of North Figueroa Street, both nominated by the Highland Park 
Heritage Trust. 
</P>
<P>
The owner of those houses, Juang Hsieh of Arcadia, supported the nomination. 
After negotiating with the Highland Park group, Hsieh agreed to scrap his 
initial plans to demolish the houses. Instead, he will build 10 units on vacant 
land around them, retaining the two 1907 Craftsman-style structures as part of 
the development. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Fisher, a Highland Park resident and member of the Heritage Trust, 
praised the developer for his willingness to work out a plan with the community 
group. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that this development can be a clear signal that preservation and 
responsible development can go hand in hand," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Argus Court in Eagle Rock did not go as amicably. The 
nomination was made by The Eagle Rock Assn., a community group that is 
promoting the protection and restoration of older buildings as part of 
ambitious proposal for the revitalization of Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The organization identified the court, near La Roda Avenue, as a landmark in 
jeopardy of being razed, said Jeffrey Samudio of TERA. 
</P>
<P>
In an application to the Cultural Heritage Commission, Samudio wrote that the 
court, designed by Edward C. Taylor, is one of only two of the distinctive 
courts surviving in Eagle Rock. Its 16 bachelor cottages all retain original 
1923 plumbing fixtures, Samudio said. 
</P>
<P>
Samudio said the nomination was opposed by Argus Court owner Tony Anton of JNA 
Colorado Ltd., who has stated plans to build a 28-unit apartment building on 
the property. Anton could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Ronald M. 
Dorffman, did not return phone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
The monument designation means that Anton would have to apply to the Cultural 
Heritage Commission for permission to make any changes in the structure that 
would damage its historic character. The commission has the power to block the 
issuance of permits for up to 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
Samudio said the college was one of two potential buyers TERA approached in the 
hope of presenting Anton an option to sell the property instead of waiting a 
year to redevelop it. The second potential buyer has asked not to be 
identified, Samudio said. 
</P>
<P>
The Eagle Rock Assn.'s overture to Occidental was well received, largely 
because of initiatives by the college's new president, John B. Slaughter, to 
embrace the community around the campus. Before Slaughter's appointment last 
year, Occidental historically remained aloof from Eagle Rock, cultivating its 
own image after that of the Eastern Ivy League schools. 
</P>
<P>
Slaughter, formerly chancellor of a campus of the University of Maryland, has 
made it clear he wants remold the college as an urban campus engaged with its 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
An opportunity to work with a community group to protect an endangered building 
may serve that goal, Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our response was we certainly would want to consider it, for, among other 
things, faculty housing, but it would depend on the cost and the cost for 
renovation," Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, the college has not contacted the owner of the courts. Before 
initiating negotiations, college officials will have to inspect the property, 
Vance said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're examining the structures ourselves and trying to determine what we think 
might be the cost of renovating them to some useful life. They're extremely run 
down at this point." 
</P>
<P>
Vance said the inspection will probably be made in mid January.

CITY CHANGED INTO URBAN CENTER DURING TURBULENT '89; 
</P>
<P>
LOOKING BACK: GLENDALE EXPERIENCES AN APARTMENT MORATORIUM BATTLE, A HOTLY 
CONTESTED CITY COUNCIL ELECTION, RUNAWAY SCHOOL CROWDING AND EMERGING GANG 
VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANTIAGO O'DONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
1989 was the year Glendale became a metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
It was a year of turmoil, and the city's leaders as much as conceded that the 
small-town era of polite stewardship by a benevolent clique has become a thing 
of the past. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning with a rough-and-tumble battle over an apartment construction 
moratorium, the year also brought the city's most hotly contested election 
campaign ever, runaway school crowding and the emergence of gang violence. City 
services were stretched by new waves of non-English-speaking immigrants, and 
the city faced the prospect of its first deficit budget. 
</P>
<P>
Once known as a mostly white, upscale bedroom community -- a nearby retreat 
from Los Angeles' urban woes -- Glendale seems to have suddenly awakened to 
discover that it is urban, dynamic and diverse. 
</P>
<P>
Public spending jumped to levels previously unheard of, and the City Council 
adopted more laws than ever before. It was the year that Glendale's government 
tossed out its traditional hands-off approach in a last-ditch attempt to keep 
the city the way it was. 
</P>
<P>
"In the old culture of Glendale," Mayor Jerold Milner said, "the basic 
political conservative philosophy was to leave as many decisions as possible to 
the individuals. But these days, people are asking the government to protect 
their quality of life, so we have to intervene." 
</P>
<P>
The year's biggest battle was fought over the growth of south Glendale 
neighborhoods zoned for apartment construction. The issue remains unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
In September, 1988, the council quickly and unexpectedly enacted a citywide 
moratorium on apartment construction. The city spent most of 1989 in court 
defending the moratorium against attacks by developers whose projects had been 
stalled in the plan-approval stage. 
</P>
<P>
A Superior Court judge ruled in November that the 20 or so projects held up by 
the moratorium should be allowed to proceed, but the council immediately 
approved an ordinance that prevented any additional apartment construction. 
</P>
<P>
The new freeze avoided the legal glitches of the first one. So far it has not 
been challenged. 
</P>
<P>
Both moratoriums were adopted for the same reason -- to give voters time to 
approve a slow-growth ordinance to keep the city's population within the 
200,000-220,000 range, as recommended in its General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
The new ordinance requires an extensive environmental impact review in which 
the city will have to justify why Glendale needs to stop growing. City planners 
acknowledge that finding a legal justification for stopping growth won't be 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
The city's rampant growth seems to respond more to international events and 
national trends than to local politics. About 25,000 new residents arrived in 
the past decade -- mostly from Armenia and Mexico -- with more than 3,000 
coming in the past year alone. The flood of immigrants, which swelled the 
city's population to about 165,000, has created an unprecedented strain on city 
services. 
</P>
<P>
Most burdened are the schools and the Police Department, but public housing, 
sewer usage and refuse collection have also been affected. 
</P>
<P>
Plans were drawn to expand the city's sewer capacity, and a mayor's task force 
was formed to propose garbage disposal alternatives to extend the life of 
Scholl Canyon landfill, which is filling up. 
</P>
<P>
This also was the year that the phrase "affordable housing" became part of the 
City Council's vocabulary. 
</P>
<P>
"A couple of years ago the phrase 'affordable housing' was a very unpopular 
cliche," Councilman Larry Zarian said. "But my own sons have grown up and can't 
afford to stay in the city. To me that realization was a very awakening thing. 
We can't allow Glendale to become a city only for the wealthy." 
</P>
<P>
After years of delays, the city accepted a state mandate and set aside $2.9 
million in property taxes from its redevelopment zone to finance low-income 
housing programs, with almost all of the money going to land purchases and 
developer incentives for three senior citizen housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
About the same time, officials learned firsthand that city residents are in 
dire need of direct housing subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
In June, more than 3,000 applicants -- the vast majority recent immigrants from 
Soviet Armenia -- erupted in a semi-riot during a sign-up session for federal 
housing vouchers in a south Glendale park. 
</P>
<P>
Their names were added to a waiting list of 1,400 for the city's 1,000 federal 
rent subsidies. Five months after the incident, the City Council voted to fund 
rent subsidies for the first time to complement the federal program -- $200,000 
for 60 rental units. 
</P>
<P>
Enrollment in the Glendale Unified School District rose to 24,000, up by more 
than 1,000 from the year before and the highest in the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
The classrooms have become increasingly diverse, increasing the demand for 
teachers with foreign language skills. The annual ethnic survey released by the 
district this year showed that enrollment by Middle Eastern students, which 
include Armenians, jumped nearly 4% to just under 6,000 students. Latino 
enrollment reached 5,800 after a modest increase this year, and minority 
enrollment overall remained steady at about 42%. 
</P>
<P>
The city's runaway growth placed unprecedented demands on the Police Department 
to fight urban crimes such as auto theft and gang violence, and to control 
traffic and monitor anti-abortion demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
It was the year that Glendale witnessed its first drive-by killing and formed 
its first police gang unit. Auto theft became the No. 1 crime. The bulk of 
police overtime hours was spent monitoring Operation Rescue rallies at clinics 
and hospitals that perform abortions. Directing traffic became an everyday 
endeavor. Violent crime went up 23%. 
</P>
<P>
The urban-type crimes prevalent today, Police Chief David Thompson said, demand 
more police officers than those in the past. "The burglary rate has gone down, 
but there's been an auto theft explosion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Police Department added 17 officers this year, more than the total increase 
in the entire decade. Thompson used the additional positions to create an 
anti-gang unit and to beef up motorcycle and foot patrols. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the city's growth, the city government had to grow too. 
</P>
<P>
In the past decade, city budget increases rarely exceeded the growth in the 
cost of living, and never by much. A city that prides itself on fiscally sound, 
penny-wise spending habits, Glendale never took on long-term debt and rarely 
dipped into its reserves. But the city's 1989-90 budget grew by a record 11%, 
almost three times higher than the increase in the cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
"This city is not known for its dynamic growth and new programs," said Finance 
Director Brian Butler after the budget was announced in May. "It's an old, 
conservative city. After this year's growth spurt, we should return to the days 
of controlled growth." 
</P>
<P>
The bulk of this year's budget increase was used to hire 61 new workers to meet 
the increasing demand for city services; only 13 new workers were hired the 
previous year. 
</P>
<P>
A new city department -- Neighborhood Services -- was created for the first 
time in 20 years. Several new offices, including permit services, graphics, 
volunteer services and the hazardous materials team, were added to the city 
bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
The city once renowned for its conservative, hands-off government adopted a 
flurry of ordinances to control everything from the location of news racks to 
the size, height and "neighborhood compatibility" of all new houses, apartments 
and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's new ordinances and resolutions were aimed at taming the 
effects of rapid growth and urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
Liquor sales in gas stations were outlawed, and laws were passed to discourage 
X-rated bookstores from opening in the city. Size limits were imposed and a 
stringent review process was created to control the construction or major 
expansion of single-family houses. 
</P>
<P>
A city initiative to ban overnight parking in south Glendale's dense 
neighborhoods was postponed after angry crowds flocked to the City Council 
chambers to speak against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
And the city struggled unsuccessfully all year to establish an official pickup 
site away from the heart of the commercial district for the increasing number 
of day laborers that now congregate on a street corner to solicit work. 
</P>
<P>
The pressures and tensions that accompany periods of transition surfaced in the 
most hotly contested City Council election since the 1930s. Thirteen candidates 
vied for three council seats in the April election. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, "Preserve traditional Glendale" was the campaign slogan 
shared by the City Council incumbents and Dick Jutras, a longtime city insider 
and former planning commissioner. Jutras won the seat of John F. Day, who 
retired. 
</P>
<P>
The incumbents were comfortably reelected, but their margin was significantly 
smaller than in previous elections. More than half the voters chose 
non-incumbents, but the 10 challengers split and diluted the protest vote. 
</P>
<P>
South Glendale, with its moderate-income, politically lethargic and mostly 
ethnic minority population, mounted its biggest challenge yet to the political 
hegemony of the city's affluent northern neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
Two south Glendale candidates ran in April on south Glendale platforms, 
creating enough interest to double the negligible voter turnout south of the 
Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
One of them, Berdj Karapetian, outspent everyone, including the incumbents. But 
his attempt to forge an alliance of apartment renters, liberal Democrats, 
low-income senior citizens, Armenians and Latinos fell far short of challenging 
the political establishment of wealthy, Republican homeowners in north 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
Though soundly defeated, Karapetian said his work has just begun. "It takes a 
lot more time and education than a two-month campaign to get people to feel 
they have an interest to protect," he said, after learning that he placed 11th 
with 3.4% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
The April elections also marked the first serious incursion into city politics 
of the fast-growing Armenian community. 
</P>
<P>
The Armenian National Committee, headquartered in Glendale, held its 
largest-ever voter registration drive and endorsed two Armenian-Americans as 
opposition candidates. It was the first time that three Armenian-Americans ran 
for the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
Armenians comprise one-fifth of the city's population, although fewer than 
2,000 are registered to vote. If they register in greater numbers, they could 
become a force in Glendale's political future. 
</P>
<P>
There was yet another -- and perhaps more significant -- development in the 
aftermath of the April election. The other south Glendale candidate, Robin 
Westmiller, formed a group that is now collecting signatures to force a change 
from at-large to council district elections. 
</P>
<P>
If her initiative succeeds, three council members who live within blocks of 
each other will have to fight for a single seat. The power of the homeowners 
associations -- virtual political machines in their ability to turn out the 
vote for the north Glendale incumbents and their heir apparents -- will 
drastically diminish. And south Glendale could have hopes of gaining its 
first-ever elected councilman. 
</P>
<P>
If 1989 is any indication of what lies ahead, Glendale will never be the same 
again.

BUILDING RULE EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter has called for a one-year extension of 
the city's interim controls on development in the Westchester Bluffs area. 
</P>
<P>
Galanter introduced a motion this month to extend temporary restrictions on 
building while city planners continue work on a final plan to regulate 
development and protect the scenic bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
The proposed extension has yet to be considered by a council's Planning and 
Land Use Committee. It also needs the approval of the full City Council. 
</P>
<P>
The interim controls, which took effect in September, 1988, were intended to 
limit building on bluff-top lots in Westchester and Playa del Rey while 
planners wrestled with how to protect the aesthetic values of the area. 
</P>
<P>
The original control ordinance states that if unregulated new development 
occurred, there would be an "irreplaceable loss" of scenic resources and 
natural features unique to the area. The fragile bluffs also have experienced 
erosion and drainage problems. 
</P>
<P>
The area affected by the controls on development extends west from Sepulveda 
Boulevard along the bluff top to Vista del Mar in Playa del Rey.

SAVINGS IN DRAINAGE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
With the county expected next month to select a contractor for the remainder of 
a $13.8-million drainage project on Big Rock Mesa, some residents have 
expressed hope that the project's cost may still be trimmed. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Caggiano, a spokesman for the Big Rock Improvement Committee, said this 
week that the group has persuaded about 60 Big Rock residents to grant the 
county rights-of-way on their properties for the work, in what could save the 
county up to $400,000 in legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got maybe two-thirds of the property owners committed, and we intend to 
keep trying for the rest," Caggiano said. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors last month approved a plan to tax 
Big Rock Mesa homeowners up to $100,000 each for a drainage system to stabilize 
the landslide-plagued community. 
</P>
<P>
The supervisors are expected to award the contract for the remainder of the 
project next month, with work to begin in March.

MURAL GRANTS AVAILABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Venice-based Social and Public Art Resource Center is offering creators of 
city murals grants of $500 to repair their works. 
</P>
<P>
"Los Angeles has long been acknowledged as the mural capital of the world, with 
well over 1,000 murals within its borders," a spokesman for the group said. 
"Many local murals have fallen into disrepair and are in need of restoration. 
Artists have been the primary caretakers of these murals without financial 
support." The program gives artists the opportunity to repair their own works 
with money from the center's Emergency Relief Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Artists should write to the Emergency Relief Fund, c/o SPARC, 685 Venice Blvd., 
Venice, Calif. 90291, describing the mural in need of repair. A photograph or 
slide of the original mural, with its date of completion, should be submitted 
along with a recent photograph or slide of the damaged work or section in need 
of restoration. Submissions should be postmarked no later than Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
SPARC is a nonprofit, community-based arts organization that promotes all 
aspects of mural painting. It receives support from the National Endowment for 
the Arts and the city's Cultural Affairs Department, among others. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, the center gave nine awards to artists for the restoration of their 
works.

BLACK HEALTH SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UCLA School of Public Health has established its first scholarship program 
for black students and named it after an alumna who has become a nationally 
recognized leader in the public health care field. 
</P>
<P>
The Betty Smith Williams Scholarship Fund was set up by the school's Health 
Careers Opportunity Program, which will oversee the scholarship process with 
the help of a committee of black alumni from the UCLA schools of public health 
and nursing. 
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of the funds raised will go toward scholarships, with the 
rest set aside for short-term emergency loans to students, UCLA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The woman for whom the program is named is a professor in the Department of 
Nursing at Cal State Long Beach and has been a member of the board of directors 
of Blue Cross of California since 1977. She also is a founding member of the 
National Black Nurses Assn. and co-founder of the Council of Black Nurses, Los 
Angeles, UCLA officials say. 
</P>
<P>
She earned a master of science degree in public health and mental health 
nursing from UCLA in 1967. She received her doctorate in public health from the 
school in 1978, specializing in behavioral sciences and health administration, 
according to UCLA officials. 
</P>
<P>
The scholarship program comes at a time when a decline in federal financial aid 
for graduate students has made it harder than ever for them to stay in school, 
said Kathleen A. Torres, director of the Health Careers Opportunity Program. 
</P>
<P>
Contributions to the fund should be made payable to the UC Regents and sent to 
the Health Careers Opportunity Program, UCLA School of Public Health, 41-240 
CHS, Los Angeles, Calif. 90024-1772.

HODGES MOVES EASILY INTO RUGBY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY KLEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Like many current and former Occidental College athletes, David Hodges' 
seasonal transition proved easy. 
</P>
<P>
As a two-time all-conference linebacker, Hodges had the size, speed and 
strength necessary to stand out as a wing-forward in rugby, a sport in which 
Occidental fields a club team each winter. 
</P>
<P>
Rugby's rough physical play without protective padding appealed to Hodges from 
the moment he put his head down and began pushing in his first scrum four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
About the only thing Hodges detested about the sport was the postmatch 
camaraderie with opponents -- one of rugby's oldest traditions. 
</P>
<P>
"In football, there's always animosity toward the other guys," says Hodges, a 
three-year starter in football who was named to the Kodak All-American college 
division team this season. "I still have it toward teams I played against. I 
never really liked any team or any of the players." 
</P>
<P>
"Then I come to rugby and you've got to shake their (opponents') hands and go 
have a beer with them. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a little trouble with that at first, but now I like it." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, a 6-foot-3, 219-pound senior, has become one of the best rugby players 
in Occidental history. 
</P>
<P>
Last summer he was selected for the Pacific Coact Grizzlies -- a regional team 
that competed in a national tournament in Colorado Springs, Colo. Based on his 
performance in the Grizzlies' two matches, Hodges was chosen for an 
All-American team that played against a Canadian national team. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges' success in rugby surprises no one who has played other sports with or 
against him. 
</P>
<P>
"He's (Hodges) a leader -- a great athlete with leverage, agility and 
aggressiveness," says rugby teammate Greg Garcia, a senior who played offensive 
line for the football team and throws the javelin in track. "No one can match 
his ability. He's pretty much in a league of his own." 
</P>
<P>
Occidental, which in a few weeks will celebrate the start of the club's 25th 
season, competes in the Southern California Rugby Football Union college 
division, a league made up of teams including Loyola Marymount, Claremont, UC 
Irvine, Cal Lutheran, UC Riverside, Cal Poly Pomona and USC. Opponents play 
each other twice during the season and also meet in two or three tournaments 
that include schools from the University Division. Occidental has never had a 
losing record. 
</P>
<P>
Hodges came to Occidental from Long Beach Wilson High for the academics and the 
chance to continue playing football. 
</P>
<P>
"I was thinking about going to UC Santa Barbara, which was starting up a 
(football) program," Hodges says. "But I came here because they already had a 
winning tradition." 
</P>
<P>
Hodges, who will graduate this spring with a degree in political science, 
helped continue the tradition after becoming a full-time starter in his 
sophomore season. He led Occidental to three Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference championships, including last season when 
he was named most valuable defensive player in the conference after the Tigers 
finished 8-2. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly, one of Hodges' favorite aspects of rugby is the freedom the 
sport allows him on offense. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensive guys like me love it because you get to touch the ball, run with it, 
pass it, kick it and score," Hodges says. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Hodges is hopeful that his prowess as a linebacker and recognition as an 
All-American will spur interest from professional football teams. He already 
has had one workout with the NFL scouting combine. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm going to put on some weight and get my speed up," Hodges says. "Playing 
pro football isn't a great possibility, but it's there. Hopefully, I'll get 
some tryouts this spring." 
</P>
<P>
If not? 
</P>
<P>
"I can always play rugby," he says. "We have guys on our alumni team 60 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
"You can always play this game if you want to."

LA CANADA SETS SIGHTS ON THIRD CONSECUTIVE RIO HONDO LEAGUE TITLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The La Canada High boys' basketball team, which saw one streak end last week, 
is trying to keep another alive. 
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Spartans fell to Pasadena in five overtimes, 82-74, a loss 
that ended La Canada's 21-game home winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the longest game I've ever seen," La Canada Coach Tom Hofman said. 
"Both teams were just hanging on." 
</P>
<P>
La Canada (6-3) held a 14-point lead in the final quarter of regulation before 
Pasadena made its run that sent the contest into the first overtime. 
</P>
<P>
La Canada will compete in the Chino tournament this week and then play 
Crescenta Valley in its final nonleague game Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
The Spartans will begin their bid for a third consecutive Rio Hondo League 
championship next Friday when they visit Monrovia for the league opener. La 
Canada is 20-0 in league play over the past two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
"We're probably playing better than I thought we would be at this time," Hofman 
said. "I think we'll be ready to go when we play Monrovia." 
</P>
<P>
Balanced attack: The Flintridge Prep girls' basketball team is trying to win 
its second consecutive Prep League championship with a team that thus far has 
exhibited balance. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels (4-1 overall, 2-0 in league play) have lost to only La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no one who has been really outstanding in every game," Flintridge Prep 
Coach John Ruch said. "It's nice that we've had different people step forward 
and play good games." 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Shawna Shearbourn has been a key player for Flintridge Prep with 
her consistent improvement, but Ruch said that the biggest surprise for the 
Rebels has been the play of junior Megan McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
"She's coming off the bench and playing as well as anyone," Ruch said. 
</P>
<P>
On the rebound: Pater Noster's record tumbled to 2-9 last Monday when it lost 
to LaSalle, 72-68. 
</P>
<P>
The defeat, however, exemplified Pater Noster's improvement this season under 
second-year Coach Michael Smith, whose Southern Section 2-A Division team faces 
a schedule full of 3-A and 4-A schools. 
</P>
<P>
It was only two weeks ago that Pater Noster lost to LaSalle by 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
Face the nation: Santiago Alvarez, who gained statewide attention this season 
for his performance as quarterback of the Franklin High football team, gained 
national recognition last week. 
</P>
<P>
Alvarez, a senior who threw 52 touchdowns and passed for more than 4,000 yards 
this season for the City Section Northern Conference-champion Panthers, was 
pictured in Sports Illustrated's "Faces in the Crowd" segment. 
</P>
<P>
On the road: The Glendale College basketball team, which has won six games in a 
row, is competing in the Palomar tournament this week. 
</P>
<P>
The eight-team, double elimination tournament also includes Citrus, Harbor, 
Fullerton, Mt. San Jacinto, Bakersfield, Riverside and Palomar. 
</P>
<P>
Glendale (10-5) is coming off a championship performance in its own tournament 
-- during which the Vaqueros defeated East Los Angeles, Harbor and Cypress -- 
and last Friday's 78-71 victory over Antelope Valley.

money together, saved it in bits and pieces to buy it. It has always been this 
very personal and loving thing." 
</P>
<P>
Today, the Summits' animals are quartered in their living room, bedrooms, den 
and in a basement gallery. The collection includes about 50 figures, all carved 
between the 1880s and the 1920s, the heyday of the American carousel business. 
</P>
<P>
When the Summits got their first horse, they didn't intend to start a 
collection, Jo Summit said. But about four years later, they saw a picture of a 
giraffe in a magazine layout. They searched out the owner and bought it. The 
giraffe "looked at us with those big soft eyes," she said, and the Summits were 
hooked. 
</P>
<P>
"The horse was special. . . . But we knew if we broke that limit -- if we got 
the giraffe -- it wouldn't be enough. It was going to start us collecting." 
</P>
<P>
By the early 1960s they had a rabbit, another horse, a dragon and a sea 
monster. Over the years, they have restored about 275 animals, many of which 
they later traded or sold. 
</P>
<P>
Rol Summit, a psychiatrist at County-Harbor UCLA Medical Center, has carved 
legs, ears, teeth and saddles. He has set glass jewels and has gold-leafed 
horses' manes. Jo Summit has removed old paint, sanded and repainted her 
animals and attached tails made of real horse hair. The couple also runs a 
small business, called Flying Horses, that supplies restoration parts to 
carousel operators and private collectors. 
</P>
<P>
The Summits have animals from Mexico, France, Germany and England. But most of 
the animals were carved by the major carvers in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Jo Summit has two favorite carvers: Daniel C. Muller and Marcus C. Illions. She 
values Muller for his realism. "He carved wonderful crenulated ribbons, rivets 
and stitching. His saddles were carved to look like tooled leather," she said. 
</P>
<P>
And she appreciates Illions for the exuberance of his horses. "Illions made 
elaborate tossed manes. Then he added gold leaf to the manes, and gold and 
silver leaf to the trappings to show them off," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There once were about 2,000 carousels across the country, but the Depression 
put most of the manufacturers out of business, according to Brian Morgan, 
chairman of Friends of the Santa Monica Carousel. The growth of more thrilling 
rides after World War II forced many operators to close their machines. 
</P>
<P>
About 170 operating merry-go-rounds exist today, said Morgan, who also is 
treasurer of the National Carousel Assn., an organization formed in 1973 to 
promote carousel preservation. Local riders can take a spin on wooden carousels 
on the Santa Monica Pier, in Griffith Park, at Shoreline Village in Long Beach, 
Magic Mountain, Disneyland and Knotts Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
Figures from broken-up machines are often bought by collectors. Many choose 
their animals for pragmatic reasons, Jo Summit said, but she based her 
selections on sentiment. "I picked the ones that I loved." 
</P>
<P>
An antique dealer once offered to trade some of the Summits' horses for one of 
three big cats he was having trouble selling. 
</P>
<P>
"He had two lions and a tiger and a whole bunch of horses," Jo Summit said. "He 
was selling the horses like crazy, but he couldn't move the lions or the tiger 
because they were bigger and cost more." 
</P>
<P>
When they agreed to the trade, she chose between the lions. 
</P>
<P>
"The other lion had lovely carvings," she said. "It had boars' heads behind the 
saddle. My lion didn't even have a saddle." 
</P>
<P>
The lion's former owner -- a lion tamer -- had all the trappings removed so it 
looked more realistic and placed the lion outside his arena. 
</P>
<P>
"The lion had this huge, dramatic mane," Jo Summit said. "All of that just made 
it special to me." 
</P>
<P>
When the couple began collecting, very little information about carousels was 
available, she said. They found one book, and they spoke to carousel operators 
at the Santa Monica Pier, Knotts Berry Farm, Griffith Park, Pacific Ocean Park 
in Venice and Beverly Park at Beverly and La Cienega boulevards. (The latter 
two parks no longer exist.) 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't know why we were interested. At first they thought we were crazy," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
But their curiosity paid off when they met Illions' sons, Rudy and Barney 
Illions. Rudy Illions was then in his late 60s and working as a machinist for 
the rides at Pacific Ocean Park. 
</P>
<P>
Rudy Illions revealed that his father was ambidextrous. 
</P>
<P>
"He told us he was very fast," she said. "He would go along from left to right, 
all the way to the front of the horse. Then he would switch the mallet and 
chisel and keep going." 
</P>
<P>
The couple's collection, which includes a number of Illions' figures, is 
arranged to illustrate different stages of restoration, an informative point 
for the many groups -- ranging from schoolchildren to senior citizens and 
antique collectors -- that visit the Summits' home. Two of Illions' horses are 
in a white primer coat and other figures have been left in factory paint. 
</P>
<P>
"Some we do in mint condition to show people what they were like -- all sparkle 
and perfect and smooth and zowie," Jo Summit said. 
</P>
<P>
"Some we restore partially, leaving all the cracks and dings . . . we think 
they show their age and the love of thousands and thousands of riders if you 
leave on some of that patina of the years." 
</P>
<P>
In the late 1970s, Jo Summit said, the couple stopped buying animals because 
the number of carousel animals available declined, and prices began to climb. 
She said they will not buy an animal that comes from an operating machine 
because they don't want to encourage breaking up machines. 
</P>
<P>
Among factors contributing to the breakup of machines are the high costs of 
upkeep and liability insurance, said Morgan of the Friends of the Santa Monica 
Carousel. Liability insurance for the Santa Monica carousel this year was 
$14,000, said Susan Maysels, assistant director of the Santa Monica Pier 
Restoration Corp. Maintenance and operating costs were about $200,000, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of restoring a merry-go-round can be prohibitive -- between $300,000 
and $800,000, Morgan said. But he said collectors pose the biggest danger to 
wooden carousels that are still operating. 
</P>
<P>
"The auction houses realize they can sell the broken-up machines and make a lot 
of money." 
</P>
<P>
Carousel animals can sell for $10,000 to $50,000 each and rare animals for more 
than $100,000, Morgan said. In 1978, the American Carousel Society was formed 
to promote collection of carousel animals rather than preservation of operating 
machines. 
</P>
<P>
Some collectors believe the wooden animals should be replaced with fiberglass 
figures, Jo Summit said. 
</P>
<P>
"The collectors have a point, too," she said. "The machines are very badly worn 
with the constant use. . . . Unfortunately, what tends to happen is that once a 
machine is broken up, it doesn't tend to be put back together. The old ones are 
being worn away. The details are being worn away. If the wood is bare and 
unprotected, that's very sad. But it's also sad to break them up." 
</P>
<P>
And Jo Summit would like carousels to go round and round for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a marvelous, magical device. The carvings, the lights, the music. It's 
fun and it's not scary. It's not only for children. It's for adults too."

TORAH REDEDICATED BY SYNAGOGUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For years, Cheri Dekofsky pored over her grandmother's photo album, haunted by 
a need to honor the memory of her relatives lost in the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
When the Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks last week rededicated a 180-year-old 
Torah scroll that survived despite its seizure by the Nazis, Dekofsky got the 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
Dekofsky helped arrange for her synagogue to receive the Torah, which is a 
handwritten Hebrew scroll that contains the first five books of the Old 
Testament and serves as the centerpiece of Jewish faith. The particular Torah 
that Dekofsky's synagogue is receiving was among 1,584 that were warehoused in 
Prague, Czechoslovakia, after World War II and later restored by the 
Westminster Synagogue in London. 
</P>
<P>
"This satisfies something very deep inside me," Dekofsky said. "The Torah has 
always represented learning, tradition and survival." 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz Chaim, which has a membership of about 700 
Conejo Valley families, said Torahs and other religious objects were seized 
from synagogues by Nazis who originally planned to destroy them, then decided 
to save the booty for a "museum to the 'extinct Jewish race.' " 
</P>
<P>
Today, synagogues and other Jewish institutions can arrange permanent loans of 
the restored Torahs. Dekofsky decided to arrange such an "adoption" for her 
temple after learning that her childhood synagogue on Long Island, N.Y., had 
done the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
"We said, 'We have to do this, this is the right thing,' " Dekofsky said, 
referring to herself and her husband, Michael. 
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony similar to that of a wedding, the Torah known as Scroll No. 1181 
was carried into the temple's sanctuary under a "chupah," or wedding canopy, 
and rededicated. Because it is brittle, stained and in many places illegible, 
the Torah will not be used during religious services but displayed in a 
Holocaust memorial, Paskow said. 
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also marked the first night of Hanukkah, which is actually a minor 
Jewish holiday whose significance has been magnified because it falls near 
Christmas. Paskow said Hanukkah was an appropriate occasion to welcome the 
Torah because the holiday marks an ancient military victory by the Hebrews over 
the Syrians -- another instance of Jewish survival. 
</P>
<P>
Dekofsky's maternal grandmother, now 92, immigrated to New York at the age of 
16. She worked as a seamstress in the city's garment district and sent money to 
her parents and three sisters in a Russian village. 
</P>
<P>
But, tragically, she sent cash instead of tickets, and her family used the 
money for her sisters' dowries instead of to travel to this country, Dekofsky 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"She cries, and says, 'If only I'd sent tickets, they'd be alive.' Who really 
knows? They all perished," Dekofsky said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Torahs are usually covered in colorful, often ornately embroidered 
cloth, Scroll No. 1181 was dressed in simple black velvet, a nod to its 
sobering history. The cloth will be inscribed in the memory of the 6 million 
Jews who died in the Holocaust.

ANTHONY GATES TO LEAD WEST L.A. AGAINST ALUMNI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anthony Gates, West Los Angeles College sophomore forward, is off to a blazing 
start. The Fremont High School graduate is averaging 19.4 points and 11 
rebounds a game and had 38 points, the fourth-best scoring game in WLAC 
history, and added 18 rebounds in a 103-94 victory over San Bernardino at the 
Riverside Tournament. He made 17 of 24 shots from the field against San 
Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
Gates and his teammates will play host to an alumni squad at 6 p.m. Friday at 
Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Culver City. The Oilers (7-8) will open Western 
State Conference play against Glendale at 2 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Those who will play for the alumni include Mike Lippman (1969-70), Ed Azzam 
(1973-75), Darryl Hawkins (1978-80) and Frank Lopez (1984-86). 
</P>
<P>
Lippman holds school records with an average of 27.2 points for one season and 
48 points in one game. Azzam, Westchester High School boys basketball coach, 
played for what may have been Coach Charles Sands' best team, which finished 
with a 23-10 record in 1974. Hawkins was captain and the most valuable player 
on the 1979-80 team that finished 23-11. Lopez leads the Oilers in career 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
Three other Oilers besides Gates have been scoring in double figures. Freshman 
guard Maurice McKinzy is averaging 14.5 points, sophomore guard David Hollaway 
14.2 and freshman guard Booker Waugh 13.5. McKinzy is also from Fremont, 
Hollaway from Crenshaw and Waugh from Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
WLAC won three of four games and finished fifth at Riverside. Besides defeating 
San Bernardino, the Oilers beat Chaffey, 77-69, and Golden West, 76-72. WLAC 
lost to San Diego Mesa, 75-72. 
</P>
<P>
Other highlights at Riverside included Hollaway's 24 points, including four 
three-point shots against Golden West; McKinzy making 13 of 14 free throws 
against San Bernardino, including 10 straight down the stretch; Waugh's 29 
points against San Diego Mesa and Gates' 19 points and 12 rebounds in the 
Chaffey game. 
</P>
<P>
The Pepperdine women's basketball team (6-3 at the start of the week) will be 
the host team for the Zuma Jay's-Lady Wave tournament, which begins Friday and 
ends Saturday at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Iowa State (6-3) will meet San Diego State (1-6) at 6 p.m., and 
Pepperdine will face Texas San Antonio (4-4) at 8 p.m. Saturday, the 
third-place game will be at 6 p.m. and the championship game at 8. 
</P>
<P>
Last week the Waves shot a season-best 55.6% from the field and defeated UC 
Santa Barbara, 65-52. 
</P>
<P>
Four Pepperdine players were scoring in double figures as the week began. 
Sophomore forward Shannon Frowiss is averaging 14.7 points a game, senior guard 
Sherri Murrell 12.2, senior forward Kristy Greenberg 11.2 and junior center 
Sharon Wilson 10.4. Frowiss was averaging a team-high 7.9 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Felice Lipscomb of Santa Monica High School, defending state champion in the 
100-meter hurdles, will compete in the 60-yard high hurdles and run anchor on 
the favored Santa Monica High mile-relay team in the Sunkist Invitational 
indoor track meet on Jan. 19 at the Sports Arena. Prep events begin at 4:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
In the 60 hurdles, Lipscomb, who won the 100 hurdles in 13.69 at the state meet 
last spring, will be facing girls who finished second and third to her in that 
event: Kwani Stewart of Yuba City and Keri Sanchez of Santa Teresa. This is the 
first time the 60-yard hurdles have been run by girls at the Sunkist. 
</P>
<P>
Three members of the U.S. national team in rhythmic gymnastics -- national 
champion Alexandra Feldman, Jennifer Hasse and Polina Friedman -- will be 
featured in the seventh annual Lights Invitational Meet at 1 p.m. Jan. 14 at 
Veterans Memorial Auditorium, Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
The meet is sponsored by the Los Angeles School of Gymnastics in Culver City. 
Alla Svirsky, coach of the U.S. national team in the 1988 Olympics, is 
executive director of the school. 
</P>
<P>
The meet will include teams from Chicago, Jacksonville, Fla.; San Francisco, 
Palos Verdes, San Pedro and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Former Pepperdine guard Dwayne Polee, the most valuable basketball player in 
the West Coast Conference in 1985 and 1986, and ex-Wave forward Eric White, an 
all-conference selection from 1985 through 1987, were named to the conference's 
all-decade team. Loyola Marymount center Hank Gathers was named the 
conference's Player of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Others named to the team of the '80s were guard John Stockton of Gonzaga, 
forward Forrest McKenzie of Loyola Marymount, guard Jose Slaughter of Portland, 
forward Robert Haugen of St. Mary's, center Scott Thompson of the University of 
San Diego, guard Quintin Dailey of the University of San Francisco and the late 
center Nick Vanos and guard Harold Keeling, both of Santa Clara.

PLAZA TO HOST HANUKKAH RITES TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In celebration of the seventh night of Hanukkah, a large menorah will be lit as 
part of a traditional Jewish ceremony tonight at the Buenaventura Plaza in 
Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
Rabbi Yakov Latowicz of Chabad, an international Orthodox Jewish organization, 
will officiate the candlelight ceremony at 6 p.m. The menorah has been 
displayed in the mall since the beginning of Hanukkah on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
The celebration will include dreidel spinning, traditional Jewish food, dancing 
and music by an Israeli band. The Hanukkah tradition of dreidel spinning is 
taken from Jewish history during the Greek persecution. Children would pretend 
to be playing with dreidels -- spinning tops -- to cover up studying the Torah 
when soldiers would pass by. 
</P>
<P>
Latowicz, who is from Melbourne, Australia, started the Ventura branch of 
Chabad two years ago after moving from Brooklyn with his wife, Sarah. Chabad 
offers educational, social and religious services to Jews of all backgrounds 
and affiliations. Services are held at the Chabad House, 5850 Thille St., 
Ventura.

NOTEBOOKTOURNAMENT JINX HOVERS OVER HEAD OF VENTURA COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Dan Larson already holds the distinction of being the only most valuable player 
not to play on the winning team in the Ventura basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
Now he would like to avoid becoming a tournament host who has never won his own 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
After an 11-year absence, Larson, the coach at Ventura High, returns to a 
tournament that twice has broken his heart in the past. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura tournament began Wednesday and continues today with consolation 
semifinals at 3:30 and 5 p.m. Championship semifinals are at 6:30 and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
The finals will be held at 8 p.m. on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
While Ventura might be a long shot to reach the final this season, the school 
made regular appearances in the championship game when Larson was its star 
player. 
</P>
<P>
In 1976, for instance, Channel Islands beat Ventura in overtime. And a year 
later, a Buena player made a last-second shot from half-court to lift the 
cross-town rival over the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
"Mike Johnson," Larson remembers. "I'll never forget. 
</P>
<P>
"I look at that court every day and I wish I was out there playing again. I 
think about it often, especially since we're losing. But now as a coach, I play 
with my mind and not my body." 
</P>
<P>
Slow start: Ventura is off to a 2-6 start and has lost two key players to 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
John Seiler has been slow recovering from a pulled hamstring in his right leg 
and center Mike Ryken twisted his right ankle and will be out another two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Defensively, we're not playing well," Larson said. "We're had injuries and at 
times we don't shoot the ball well. That's going to lend itself to some 
losses." 
</P>
<P>
Walking in pain: St. Bonaventure High Coach Marc Groff knows the walk of an 
injured basketball player. 
</P>
<P>
They make turns like an 18-wheeler in a business district and they're slower 
than third-class mail. 
</P>
<P>
When senior guard Kevin Zoll walked into practice last week, Groff knew it was 
going to be a short stop. 
</P>
<P>
Zoll, who averages 12 points and four assists a game, had injured his left knee 
in the second half of a nonleague game against Flintridge Prep on Dec. 15. The 
injury was originally diagnosed as a strained ligament. 
</P>
<P>
"I could tell by the way he was walking, the knee was still giving him 
trouble," Groff said. "It wasn't healing right. It was too stiff and too sore 
to be a simple strain." 
</P>
<P>
Zoll, a three-year starter who is also the baseball team's best pitcher, missed 
nearly three weeks of practice and a game against Santa Paula. Still, however, 
he walked like he needed a cane. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors confirmed Groff's suspicion Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Zoll has torn cartilage in his left knee and will undergo arthroscopic surgery 
on Friday. He'll be out four to six weeks after the operation. 
</P>
<P>
Pointless problem: Poor Oxnard. It seems as if Coach Danny Garcia is scrambling 
to replace starters every year. This season, Garcia's projected backcourt of 
juniors Yusef Sharp and Ruben Bryant have played one game together. 
</P>
<P>
Sharp, a 5-foot-10 point guard, has missed the past two games with back spasms. 
Bryant, who plays both guard positions, strained ligaments in his right knee 
and hasn't played since the first game. 
</P>
<P>
Most coaches would be scared to play without a natural point guard. But with 
swingman Antonio Williams in the lineup, Garcia discovered there's no point in 
worrying. 
</P>
<P>
Williams, a junior, has averaged 20.3 points and four assists a game while 
moving from swingman to point guard. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever had a player average 20 points a game," said Garcia, 
whose team is 4-4 and gave powerful Santa Clara a tough time before falling. 
"The amazing part is that he's playing out of position." 
</P>
<P>
Shooting for perfection: Buena High's girls' basketball team completed its 
nonleague schedule with an 8-0 record and two tournament titles. But despite 
having gone a week without a game, the Bulldogs have been busy practicing 
rather than celebrating their success. 
</P>
<P>
"Players become too easily satisfied with success," Coach Joe Vaughan said. 
"It's not good enough to win. You have to play well, too. I want our team to 
play at the same level with the best teams in the state. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday, the Bulldogs humbled upstart Westlake, 59-45, in the final of the 
Simi Valley tournament. But Vaughan was unhappy with the team's performance. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't play well against Westlake," Vaughan said. "We weren't shooting 
well. I don't if we were tired or what. We need this week to practice and 
refine our game."

Women will be earning more doctoral degrees than men by the year 2000, the 
Department of Education predicted in a study entitled "Projections of Education 
Statistics to 2000." The department said also that elementary and secondary 
school enrollments wil rise dramatically and teachers will be paid 14% more in 
real purchasing power. Women have been earning more associate, bachelor's and 
master's degrees than men in recent years, but 1999 is expected to be the first 
year that they exceed men in the number of doctoral degrees received. Men are 
expected to continue to earn more first-time professional degrees in fields 
such as medicine and law.

MAJOR QUAKE HITS AUSTRALIA; 1 KILLED, 21 HURT

A major earthquake shook Australia's southeast coast this morning, demolishing 
homes and trapping people inside cars in the city of Newcastle, officials said. 
At least one death and 21 injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said hundreds of thousands of homes lost 
electricity as a result of the 10:28 a.m. quake. 
</P>
<P>
"Many homes, banks, shops and stores have been demolished," its report said. 
"There is severe damage." 
</P>
<P>
News reports said the quake lasted 45 seconds in some places and was felt 
across the state of New South Wales. Officials at the Australian Seismological 
Center in Canberra said the epicenter of the quake was 40 miles west of 
Newcastle in an uninhabited area. They said the temblor had a magnitude of 5.5. 
</P>
<P>
Buildings in Sydney were also rocked by the quake. 
</P>
<P>
Newcastle, 75 miles north of Sydney, is Australia's sixth largest city. It has 
a population of about 500,000 and the largest concentration of heavy industry 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
The Australian Broadcasting Corp. said at least one person was killed in a 
collapsed building, another was seriously injured, and 20 suffered minor 
injuries. A major emergency alert was declared. 
</P>
<P>
"It felt like there was someone under my bedroom floor who lifted the house," 
said one Newcastle resident after the initial shake. 
</P>
<P>
Bureau of Mineral Resources Associate Director Peter Cook said the quake was 
unusually large for Australia. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a fairly large one by Australian standards," he said, warning there might 
be aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of emergency workers were flown by helicopter to the Newcastle area 
and the nearby Hunter Valley wine-growing region, which appeared to bear the 
brunt of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
One official in Newcastle, his voice shaking with emotion, said: "We just don't 
have enough men here to deal with it. There are several buildings collapsed in 
Hamilton (a Newcastle suburb)." 
</P>
<P>
Radio stations said the roof of a supermarket in a shopping center in Newcastle 
had collapsed.

THE BLOOM IS OFF THE ROSE PARADE; 
</P>
<P>
NEW YEAR'S: ORGANIZERS AND PROMOTERS HAVE SEVERAL THEORIES TO EXPLAIN LOWER 
ENTHUSIASM FOR THIS YEAR'S PROCESSION AND FOOTBALL GAME.

With only four days to go before Pasadena's 101st Tournament of Roses Parade, 
officials say thousands of parade tickets remain unsold and that tickets to the 
Rose Bowl game have not gone as quickly as in previous years. 
</P>
<P>
Held back by earthquake jitters, bored over a second USC-Michigan match-up and 
sated by last year's 100th anniversary blow-out, many fans have been slow this 
year to flock to Southern California's premier New Year's Day procession and 
football game. 
</P>
<P>
A few thousand unsold seats line the 5 1/2-mile parade route, said Sindee 
Anderson, general manager of Sharp Seating Co., which puts up 100,000 
grandstand seats. 
</P>
<P>
In a normal year, only a handful would remain by this point, Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
The head of a tour company that takes senior citizens to the parade and the 
Rose Bowl game estimated that the number of his visitors is down by half this 
year. "One group from Florida that usually brings 250 interested only 35 this 
year," said Bud Johnsen of Special Events Services. "Instead of three bus loads 
from Amarillo, Tex., I've got a bus and a half." 
</P>
<P>
Even Pasadena Mayor William Thomson found an unresponsive market for the 100 
Rose Bowl tickets that he distributed at face value, $42 apiece, for the 
USC-Michigan match up. "Up until (University of Michigan Coach) Bo Schembechler 
announced his retirement, there was not much of a demand for tickets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
With hundreds of thousands of people expected to line the parade route and more 
than 100,000 expected to jam themselves into the Rose Bowl, it's not as if no 
one is coming to Pasadena's party. But city and parade officials, as well as 
those who make their livings from the parade, are used to a higher level of 
enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
They have different theories about why there isn't more excitement this year. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the earthquake," Anderson said. The 7.1-magnitude temblor in 
Northern California on Oct. 17 caused widespread damage and spawned tabloid 
predictions that California will fall into the ocean by Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
East Coast customers have mentioned those accounts when they canceled tickets, 
Anderson said. "Most of us Californians are not worried about the shaking," she 
said. "I know one tour operator who is telling them, 'You have to love 
California with all its faults.' " 
</P>
<P>
Johnsen believes that the parade's 100th anniversary celebration in 1989 
undercut enthusiasm for the 1990 parade. "The Tournament of Roses Assn. 
oversold the 100th anniversary," he said. "If you were coming from out of 
state, you went last year. It's easing down a little this year." 
</P>
<P>
But Jay Brooks of Al Brooks Rose Bowl Tours believes that domestic travel is 
down in general and the lagging Rose Parade business simply reflects an 
industrywide trend. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, the idea that the same two college teams are playing for the second 
year in a row at the Rose Bowl has not helped. "People said, 'Oh gee, Michigan 
and USC again, what's new?' " Thomson said. 
</P>
<P>
But after Schembechler, the 21-year Michigan coach and veteran of eight 
previous Rose Bowls, announced his retirement in mid-December, demand did heat 
up for game tickets. 
</P>
<P>
Most people trying to buy game tickets will now have to pay between $75 and 
$250 to ticket agencies, which buy their tickets from the public and the 
colleges. The $42 face-value tickets have all been accounted for, according to 
Jack French, executive director of the Tournament of Roses Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Under the tournament's ticket distribution system with the National Collegiate 
Athletic Assn., the PAC 10 schools receive 52,000 tickets, the Big 10 gets 
23,000 and the tournament association receives 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
Of the tournament tickets, about 10,000 are allocated to the 1,400 tournament 
association members, whose entitlements are based on seniority. Another 7,000 
tickets are purchased by float sponsors, 3,500 are set aside for a lottery for 
the general public, 1,200 are sold to the city of Pasadena and the rest are 
used for promotion. 
</P>
<P>
City employees receive about 400 of the city tickets. The employees are 
selected to buy $42 tickets by department heads in drawings or by other methods 
devised by supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
"We use them basically to do P.R. for the city and promote the name of the 
city," said Ed Aghjayan, assistant city manager of Pasadena. For example, 
tickets are sold at face value to members of Congress, mayors and school 
officials throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the Board of Directors, the city's seven-member council that 
includes the mayor, also receive 100 tickets each. The directors sell their $42 
tickets to campaign supporters, family members, neighborhood organizations and 
residents within their districts. 
</P>
<P>
The board's ticket giveaway was criticized in 1987, when the Super Bowl was 
played at the Rose Bowl. After allegations of cronyism and favoritism were 
leveled against them, directors passed rules tightening ticket distribution. A 
list of people receiving tickets must be kept, and recipients must pledge not 
to resell them -- a pledge board members say is nearly impossible to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
Among those receiving tickets at face value this year is Billy Hinsdale, a 
14-year-old newspaper carrier from Saratoga, Calif. Billy wrote the city's 
mayor in November, saying he would save money from his newspaper route to buy 
tickets for his mother, father and sister Kathryn. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been a good person for most of my life," Billy wrote. "I get good grades 
and stay out of trouble."

Six people complained of lightheadedness, nausea and other symptoms in a 
Century City theater Wednesday night after viewing a graphic scene in the movie 
"Born on the Fourth of July," officials said. 
</P>
<P>
According to Los Angeles County Health Department spokeswoman Sharon Wanglin, 
four Los Angeles City Fire Department rescue units were called to the Century 
Plaza Cinemas at the ABC Entertainment Center about 7:30 p.m. Only one person 
was taken to a hospital, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Wanglin said the health department will investigate the incident. She said 
department inspectors at the scene determined that the sickness was not caused 
by food.

THEY'RE IN THE FUNNY MONEY

<P>
For at least a moment, it must have seemed like Christmas came late to a 
northeast Los Angeles neighborhood Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Police responded to a 7:30 a.m. call about $20 bills "flying all over" Los 
Feliz Boulevard near Lowry Road, Officer Gene Hancock said. By the time 
officers arrived at the scene -- within six minutes -- the money was virtually 
gone. 
</P>
<P>
One problem, said Hancock. Turns out the bills were fake. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a good photographic copy of the money, but it was obviously the wrong 
kind of paper," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The police weren't the only ones who realized the money was funny. "People kept 
calling and saying, 'It's fake' and hanging up," Officer Cook Barela said. 
</P>
<P>
One woman brought in 41 of the $20 bills Wednesday morning, Hancock said. For 
others holding onto the fake cash, Hancock politely warns that possession of 
counterfeit currency is against the law. 
</P>
<P>
Police remain uncertain how much may have been scattered. And how the bills 
came to rest on Los Feliz Boulevard is still unexplained. 
</P>
<P>
It's not unusual for people to throw money around at Christmas, the officers 
noted. But Barela offered a few suggestions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was 'Totally Hidden Video,' " he said, referring to a current 
television show similar to "Candid Camera." "Either that, or a present from 
Noriega." LORI GRANGE

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DISNEY FIRES 3 MEN WHO REFUSED TO SHAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Walt Disney Attractions, which leases and manages the Queen Mary in Long Beach, 
has fired three mustachioed employees for refusing to abide by company policy 
that bans facial hair. 
</P>
<P>
A Queen Mary spokesman said the union representing the three men has filed 
grievances with Disney, and another union has filed grievances on behalf of 
three employees who shaved their mustaches but were unhappy about having to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
Although Disney Attractions has been managing the Queen Mary and the nearby 
Spruce Goose for two years, it did not begin enforcing its strict grooming 
policies until this month.

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: PANEL UPHOLDS FIRING OF SHERIFF'S DEPUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The county Civil Service Commission on Wednesday upheld the firing of a 
sheriff's deputy who failed to tell superiors he was asked to smuggle cocaine 
to an inmate at County Jail near downtown Los Angeles or that he was dating the 
inmate's sister. 
</P>
<P>
The panel voted 3-0 to sustain the Nov. 23, 1988, dismissal of John R. 
Anderson, an eight-year Sheriff's Department veteran. Anderson denied that he 
supplied drugs to inmate Mike Fields in 1987 and insisted that he thought he 
was being asked to bring Coca-Cola to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
Although a sheriff's investigation cleared Anderson of cocaine smuggling, 
hearing officer Richard C. Wulliger concluded that the deputy "could be as pure 
as the driven snow with regard to drug smuggling and still be guilty of not 
reporting a solicitation to bring drugs in." Wulliger also concluded that 
Anderson failed to inform his superiors he was dating Fields' sister, whom he 
married in July, 1987.

A NEW WAY TO SPEND AT MALL -- PAY TICKETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN H. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Aren't malls the coolest? You can shop at the mall, eat at the mall, bank at 
the mall and, best of all, hang out at the mall. And starting next month, 
you'll be able to pay off traffic tickets there. 
</P>
<P>
At a ribbon-cutting ceremony Wednesday, mall and Traffic Court officials marked 
the imminent opening of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza traffic ticket payment 
office -- next to Sears. 
</P>
<P>
The office, scheduled to open Jan. 16, will house computer operators who will 
be equipped to accept payment of fines, schedule court appointments and 
register violators in traffic school. 
</P>
<P>
Fines can still be paid through the mail, said Municipal Presiding Judge Larry 
Fidler. But for those who prefer to do business in person, the office will be 
open from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
The Baldwin Hills facility joins two other ticket payment centers run by the 
county. Fidler said an office in Westchester, which opened in December, 1985, 
and a West Valley branch, which opened in the spring, have been running 
smoothly. Each averages about 6,000 customers a month, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Fidler said that according to customer surveys, the typical visitor to the 
offices waits fewer than five minutes for service. 
</P>
<P>
Officials anticipate that the Baldwin Hills office will funnel away some of the 
people who crowd the downtown Traffic Courthouse, said Annette Waller, Traffic 
Court division chief. On an average day, payment of 2,500 fines are processed 
there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Mall shoppers passing by the ribbon-cutting ceremony predicted that the payment 
office will prove a welcome alternative to going downtown. 
</P>
<P>
Andrea Kiongozi, 29, a construction company dispatcher who lives in Baldwin 
Hills, said driving downtown, parking and waiting for a court assignment were 
the biggest inconveniences she went through when she received a ticket 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I went to the courthouse on my lunch hour, hoping it wouldn't take too long," 
Kiongozi said. "I wound up taking half a day off from work."

MOTOR COACH TOUR TAKES THE HIGH-LIFE ROAD TO CHRISTMAS LIGHT SHOWS 
</P>

<P>
Frustrated sightseers looking for the season's most colorful displays of 
holiday lights often end up seeing red. 
</P>
<P>
That's the color of the unbroken string of taillights ahead of them as carloads 
of spectators creep along gridlocked residential streets renamed Candy Cane 
Lane and Elf Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
But not everybody fumes over the traffic jams that have become holiday 
traditions of sorts in scattered neighborhoods around Los Angeles. The lucky 
ones reach for crackers and cheese and another glass of fume. 
</P>
<P>
They are the ones who see the season in style from luxurious motor coaches that 
travel to decorated pockets of Pasadena, Altadena, San Marino and Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
For the past two weeks, a Newport Beach bus operator has offered the holiday 
tours to anyone willing to spend $550 to treat friends to a ride up and down 
streets lined with rows of plywood little drummer boys and cutout Santa 
Clauses. 
</P>
<P>
Those aboard Ralph Simpson's $375,000 kitchen- and bar-equipped Pacific 
Motorcoach bus Tuesday night for a day-after-Christmas peek at Christmas came 
away with a new appreciation for mass transit. And the neighborhoods' brightly 
lit decorations weren't bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
"Look, there's a dark house," joked passenger Bruce Ludwig of Hancock Park. 
"Let's stop there and throw Brie at them. They're ruining our night." 
</P>
<P>
Hancock Park residents Joyce and Lockwood Haight invited Ludwig and 13 other 
friends along for the tour. At first, the idea left a few of the guests cold. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't excited at first about spending three hours on a bus," said Patricia 
Frandson of Van Nuys. "When I think of buses, I think of the thing I rode to 
school every day when I was growing up in Toledo." 
</P>
<P>
But the passengers ended up impressed by what they saw. "I thought they were 
nuts at first to invite us to a bus . . . but I'm glad I came," said Bill Baird 
of Hancock Park. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I have to twist any arms? Only 14," Joyce Haight said with a laugh as 
driver David Foesch maneuvered the 40-foot bus down Medford Road, a street in 
the Upper Hastings Ranch area of Pasadena fully decorated with a Christmas 
angel theme. The 44-block neighborhood has been decorated with street-by-street 
themes for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
"If anybody asks, we'll tell them we're Japanese tourists and we're going to 
buy their neighborhood," shouted Ludwig from the rear of the bus. "They change 
their decoration theme every year here. Why don't we buy last year's stuff to 
use in our neighborhood next year?" 
</P>
<P>
The passengers frequently rushed to the windows when the bus passed by 
particularly spectacular lights during the tour. The route included the 
10,000-bulb-decorated Bailian House in Pasadena, half a mile of lighted cedar 
trees along Santa Rosa Avenue and similarly lighted St. Albans Road in San 
Marino. 
</P>
<P>
One homeowner in the Upper Hastings Ranch neighborhood, dressed as Santa Claus, 
flagged down the luxury coach in front of his house and offered candy to the 
passengers. Other residents waved from their front porches. 
</P>
<P>
Wade Wright, coordinator of this year's Christmas decorations for the Upper 
Hastings Ranch Assn., said about 900 of his community's 1,100 houses are lit 
this month. He said most of his neighbors welcome tour buses -- except for a 
few living on Denair Street. 
</P>
<P>
"They've objected to the bus fumes," Wright said Wednesday. "Maybe next year 
we'll make that a walking area." 
</P>
<P>
Bus riders are likely to consider that a step in the wrong direction.

PUTTING THE MUSCLE ON FLAB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It may be a sluggish holiday retail season, but it's boom time for the folks 
who sell exercise machines to help us burn up the guilt of holiday calories. 
And sweat, we are told, has gone high tech. 
</P>
<P>
High tech has brought us "electronically enhanced stationary cycles" in place 
of ordinary stationary bikes. If you want to find out if you have too much fat, 
a mere pinch of the upper arm will no longer do; now, a little machine that 
looks as if it could also give you the temperature of your roasted turkey can 
tell your percentage of body fat. Will discussion of body fat percentages now 
join small talk about cholesterol levels as acceptable conversation over 
dinner? Or, more appropriately, over a couple of glasses of mineral water? 
</P>
<P>
These state-of-the-art machines and devices are the latest weapons in the never 
ending battle against flab: This time of year television, radio and newspapers 
are full of ads for speedy weight- loss promotions and programs. Some play on 
the guilt angle, typically showings pictures of slothful persons breaking 
springs on bathroom scales. Or there is the fantasy approach, with ads 
featuring the sinewy bodies of professional models -- the implication being 
that you can look like them if only you pulled yourself out of the easy chair 
and jumped onto the treadmill. And there are year-end sales for memberships in 
gyms that offer the use of exercise machines complete with video screens and 
sound effects that duplicate the exertion of climbing stairs, riding bicycles 
or rowing boats. 
</P>
<P>
But some experts say that since the body's cardiovascular system does not know 
the difference between walking up real stairs and using a machine to duplicate 
the task, the equipment's price tags are an expensive affect merely to satisfy 
a need for digital computer numbers and "bells and whistles." Instead of using 
sophisticated machines, one exercise science professor proposes a radical idea: 
walking daily wherever you can do it (no charge on that yet, unless a personal 
trainer walks with you). That makes more sense, he suggests, than having people 
drive and take elevators to go to a club filled with exercise machines. 
</P>
<P>
He may be right. But we hasten to suggest that if someone were to invent a 
motorized sidewalk cart that offered a sumptuous holiday meal, a cool drink -- 
and maybe a bell and a whistle -- that most of us would walk quickly after it. 
In fact, such a machine would probably sell like, well, hot cakes.

WHAT PRICE PEACE OF MIND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The devastating fire that damaged or destroyed 15 buildings, including a 
high-rise condominium, smaller apartment complexes and single-family homes in 
Westwood last weekend, provides yet another sad reminder of the importance of 
sprinklers in high-rise buildings. 
</P>
<P>
There were no sprinklers in the 14-story Wilshire Terrace, next door to the 
construction site where the fire broke out. Sprinklers, according to fire 
department experts, could have kept the fire from spreading throughout the 
high-rise and minimized the massive destruction, which accounted for 75% of the 
total loss estimated at $25 million. 
</P>
<P>
Everyone knows that automatic sprinklers save lives and property by containing 
or extinguishing blazes before the flames can spread, but property owners and 
renters often balk at the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Installing sprinklers costs anywhere from $1.25 to $3.50 per square foot in new 
construction, according to builders and fire experts. In older buildings, the 
price ranges from $4 to $7 per square foot. If asbestos must be removed, the 
cost can run $20 per square foot or more. It's a hefty sum, but phasing in the 
requirement can spread the expense over several years. 
</P>
<P>
Current state laws require sprinklers in all high-rises built after 1974. After 
last year's inferno at the First Interstate Tower, which killed one person and 
did $45 million in damage, Mayor Tom Bradley proposed mandatory sprinklers for 
all high-rise buildings, commercial and residential properties in the city of 
Los Angeles. The City Council approved the commercial requirement, but rejected 
the life-saving measure for residential high-rises after owners complained 
about the costs. 
</P>
<P>
The high cost of sprinklers is certainly a problem, especially for senior 
citizens or renters on fixed incomes, but what is the price of peace of mind? 
Better to bear the expense of sprinklers then to bear the burden of losing 
everything or a loved one. Public safety warrants mandatory sprinklers in all 
high-rise buildings.

FREEDOM FOR INFORMANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
In response to "Deals Won Jail Informant Freedom to Attack Again," Part A, Dec. 
11: 
</P>
<P>
The article by Ted Rohrlich failed to recognize a fundamental principle of 
criminal sentencing practice in California courts. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have a role to play in the sentencing process. We are obligated to 
seek proper sentences in criminal cases and, in discharging that 
responsibility, deputy district attorneys routinely urge judges to impose 
appropriate sentences based upon relevant considerations. 
</P>
<P>
In that context, a defendant who has provided significant assistance to law 
enforcement is entitled -- as a matter of law -- to have that favorable 
background information brought to the attention of the sentencing judge. In 
many cases, a defendant's background information warrants a harsh sentence and, 
in other cases, it warrants more lenient treatment. Obviously, the weight to be 
given such information is left to the discretion of the sentencing judge. 
</P>
<P>
An example of one aspect of this process can readily be found in the Stephen 
Cisneros case. At the request of Cisneros' defense attorney, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Stephen Kay drafted a letter accurately outlining what Cisneros had done in the 
Norris-Bittaker case. That letter was ultimately presented to the court at 
Cisneros' sentencing hearing. The court took that letter into consideration in 
sentencing Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
The tragic fact that Cisneros later committed a number of very serious crimes 
should not overshadow the absolute propriety of Kay's earlier conduct.

PROPOSITION 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As I read the unending stream of opinions on the impending court challenge to 
Proposition 13, I am continually amazed how self-serving property owners can 
think up endless rationalizations and justifications for the huge inequities of 
the present system. I own my own home and am presently paying about half the 
property tax I would pay if it were appraised at market value. This in no way 
leads me to believe that Proposition 13 is fair in its discrimination against 
new home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
As a Southern California Realtor, I am also amazed that a professor of 
economics at a local university (letter, Dec. 11) could so ignorantly theorize 
that current real estate prices are lower than they would be without 
Proposition 13. Perhaps they do not teach supply and demand at his university, 
but any thinking person must realize that many property owners who have owned 
their homes for many years are dissuaded from selling and buying a larger, 
smaller or differently located one, simply because of the huge increase in 
property taxes they would face. Hence the supply of homes for sale is greatly 
reduced and the resultant prices go through the roof. 
</P>
<P>
Fairness and equality to all demand that Proposition 13 be repealed and 
everyone be put on an equal tax footing. And to the consternation of 
speculators, but to the great relief of young people who dream of owning their 
own homes, real estate prices just might stabilize in the Southland.

So, Chief Deputy Dist. Atty. Gregory Thompson defends offering preferential 
treatment to jail informants. 
</P>
<P>
Informant Cisneros was granted an early release after giving his (perjured) 
testimony -- despite the fierce objections of his therapist and probation 
officer. Upon his release, Cisneros committed several brutal rapes. Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Kay calls this a "small, teeny little offshoot" of the informant 
program. 
</P>
<P>
I wonder if Kay (or the other attorneys and judges agreeing to the plea 
bargains) would agree that this was a "teeny" price to pay if his mother, 
sister, wife, or daughter were one of Cisneros' brutal rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
Somehow, I don't think so.

IRON CURTAIN OF TECHNOLOGY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Washington is running no easy gauntlet trying to decide what technology can 
safely be sold to East Europe now that the region is trying to recover from 40 
years of communism. If officials move too fast, they will stir up 
still-suspicious conservatives at home. But taking too long would tempt Western 
Europe to make its own decisions about what is safe, a development that could 
lose customers for American companies. And the prize for getting East Europe 
straightened out will be a chance to move to the even tougher question of what 
can be sold directly to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
The question of how high is high technology was very much on Washington's mind 
even before last week, when the Soviet Union and the 12 members of the European 
Community signed their first trade agreement. The trade that interests the 
Soviets most is in technology that can help pull their economy into the 20th 
Century before the century ends. 
</P>
<P>
Under agreements between the United States and 17 other manufacturing nations, 
none sells technology that the United States thinks has military applications. 
But in the U.S., deciding what's hot military technology and what's not is a 
decision shared among the Pentagon, the Commerce and State departments. 
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon's take-no-chances definition usually prevails. Months ago, it 
included what by American standards is an ancient computer, available in most 
department stores. 
</P>
<P>
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher wants to trim the list of forbidden 
technology for shipment to Hungary and any other Eastern European countries 
that agree to allow Western observers to verify that the technologies do not 
leak to the Soviet Union. The items with the highest priorities are medical 
equipment, electronic banking devices, airplanes, helicopters and classroom 
technology. Mosbacher argues that nothing belongs on the list if it can be 
bought on open markets elsewhere in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The next step would be to trim the same list for sale to or use by 
joint-venture companies in the Soviet Union. At least initially, it would make 
sense to require observers to make certain that technology did not move into 
military channels. 
</P>
<P>
The White House must knock heads as early and often as necessary to get the 
lists trimmed. That Europe does not see trade as either an abstraction or a 
military problem is exemplified by the way East Germans and West Germans are 
racing toward de facto unification through channels of commerce. Americans must 
be in the race.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL: JOE PATERNO SAYS HE WON'T KNOW WHICH PENN STATE TEAM WAS HIS 
BEST UNTIL HE SEES WHAT THE PLAYERS DO IN THE REAL WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>

SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Joe Paterno's eyes squinted at the alarm clock next to his bed. It was 3:30 in 
the morning Wednesday. He thought briefly about getting up and going over some 
game plans, but while his mind was able and willing, his body told him to keep 
sleeping. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled the covers back up, and the next thing Paterno knew -- oh my gosh -- 
it was already 6. 
</P>
<P>
There was a game plan to prepare. Practice in three hours. Recruits to call. An 
ESPN interview later in the afternoon. And . . . oh, no, a Holiday Bowl 
luncheon aboard an aircraft carrier. That will take about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno, 63, walked across his hotel room, opened his drapes, looked toward the 
skies and, yes, there was some hope after all. The skies were gray, thick 
clouds hovering above, and maybe, just maybe, rain would soon follow. 
</P>
<P>
That's right. Joe Paterno brings his Penn State football team to California for 
the first time in 16 years, and what does he do? He prays for rain. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got so much to do," Paterno said. "It's a lot tougher on the West 
Coast with the time difference. By the time you get ahold of recruits back 
east, they're already having dinner or are out for the night." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno glances upward, begrudgingly concedes that it isn't going to rain, 
tosses his sport jacket in the back seat of his car and is ready to commence 
another day in the life of a college coach. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno has won more football games than any active coach with the exception of 
Bo Schembechler of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
He has been voted coach of the year four times. 
</P>
<P>
He is the only football coach ever selected as Sports Illustrated's Sportsman 
of the Year. 
</P>
<P>
And he has led Penn State to two national championships, six undefeated 
seasons, 15 finishes in the top 10, a 31-game unbeaten streak and 19 bowl 
games. 
</P>
<P>
But, dammit, he has got to learn that he can't control the weather, too. 
</P>
<P>
"Don't tell him that," said Bob Phillips, a Penn State assistant, "or he'll 
figure out a way to do that too." 
</P>
<P>
Yes, calling Joseph Vincent Paterno just a football coach is like saying 
Leonardo da Vinci was just a painter or Winston Churchill was just another 
politician. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, you don't think a little ol' coach such as Paterno had an influence 
in the recent decision by Big Ten presidents to allow Penn State into their 
conference, do you? 
</P>
<P>
After all, wasn't Schembechler just moaning and groaning the other day about 
the fact that he and the other Big Ten athletic administrators were left in the 
dark about this historical decision? 
</P>
<P>
"I'll talk to Bo after the Rose Bowl," said Paterno, his face breaking into an 
expansive grin. "I'll talk to him the day after. Of course, if he loses, I may 
wait a month." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno, who prefers being called an educator instead of having the silly title 
of coach in front of his name, is Penn State. 
</P>
<P>
This is man who, in 1982, three weeks after winning the Sugar Bowl and the 
national championship, marched into a meeting with the university's board of 
trustees and scolded them. 
</P>
<P>
He urged the board to raise entrance requirements. He demanded that they hire 
superior and vibrant professors. He called for a fund-raising drive, in 
particular to raise more money for the school library. 
</P>
<P>
Not one mention was made of athletics or any nonsense about enhancing the 
weight-training facilities. 
</P>
<P>
"Football is part of life," Paterno said, "not life itself." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno was selected co-chairman of the fund-raising campaign and has collected 
more than $310 million. A total of $330 million expected by June. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, $150,000 of that can directly be attributed to Paterno. He donated 
$100,000 to the school library and $50,000 to the minority student fund. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure if I should have done that now," Paterno said. "Now, my kids 
think I'm rich." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno laughed and said he certainly wouldn't be in this business if he ever 
wanted to be wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
The man behind the Photogray trifocals, with 20-20,000 eyesight, was supposed 
to be sitting in a three-piece suit with his Gucci shoes propped on his desk 
every day, not pacing the sidelines with a sweat shirt, white socks and a pair 
of Nikes. 
</P>
<P>
He indeed was bred to be more than a coach. His aunt was in charge of foreign 
languages for a Long Island school district; his cousin became president of 
Chrysler, and his father went to night school until he was 40 to obtain his law 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
When Paterno accepted Rip Engle's offer in 1950 to be an assistant coach at 
Penn State, he promised his father he did it only to earn extra money for law 
school. It has been 39 years now, and Paterno has yet to take his first law 
class. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, he's a coach all right: His 219-57-3 record certainly verifies that. 
</P>
<P>
But how many coaches do you know who draw up game plans while listening to the 
opera, write opinion pieces for the New York Times or quote Browning? 
</P>
<P>
How many coaches do you know who give their players permission to skip practice 
to study for a big test, install a two-hour mandatory study hall every night 
during a player's freshman year and have a wife tutoring English and a son 
tutoring math to the players? 
</P>
<P>
How many coaches do you know whose phone numbers are listed in the phone book, 
receive ovations when they simply rise to go to the bathroom during basketball 
games and have been the subject of look-alike contests -- "I don't know why 
anyone would want to win," he says -- the past three homecomings? 
</P>
<P>
How many coaches do you know who drive a Ford Escort around town, live in the 
same house they've owned the past 22 years and once turned down a four-year 
contract worth $1.4 million from the New England Patriots to stay at a 
$35,000-a-year job? 
</P>
<P>
"You know, every once in a while I'll see the Super Bowl, and I'll think how 
nice it would be to be involved in that," Paterno said. "But that passes in a 
hurry. 
</P>
<P>
"My wife and I, we're not money people. I wouldn't know what to do with it. 
People say, 'Why don't you get a BMW or something to drive in.' Me? I'd be too 
nervous driving one of those jobs. They say, 'OK, how about buying your wife a 
fur coat.' Hey, she doesn't want one. 
</P>
<P>
"Believe me, we're perfectly comfortable with the way things are." 
</P>
<P>
Paterno, who's riding shotgun on the way to San Diego Jack Murphy Stadium so he 
can talk about life at State College, Pa., never, of course, will be satisfied 
with himself. 
</P>
<P>
Since the day he arrived at Penn State, he has been a brooder, a fanatic about 
details and a hopeless notemaker. He goes to bed at 11:30. He's usually up at 5 
but often feels guilty that he's sleeping too much and awakens at 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
Teams might beat Paterno with their talent. There are times he'll even be 
outcoached. But never does Paterno want it said that he was beaten because of 
forgotten details. 
</P>
<P>
"I just hate to lose," he said, "God, I hate to lose. I know I preach a lot 
about being willing to lose, that there can be valor in losing to a better 
opponent, but Ihave never learned how not to hate losing." 
</P>
<P>
Winning is such an obsession to Paterno that his first thought on most mornings 
is the games Penn State has lost and what he could have done differently. It 
took him 10 months to get over the 1979 Sugar Bowl defeat, which cost Penn 
State the national championship. And he has been miffed for 20 years now that 
President Richard Nixon had the gall to declare Texas the national champion in 
1969 when Penn State was undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Four years later, at Penn State's commencement ceremonies, Paterno said, "If 
President Nixon knew so little about Watergate, how could he know so much about 
football?" 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Paterno had himself partially to blame, too. He voted for Nixon in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
He didn't say who got his vote in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The telephone rang in Paterno's room. It was Jack White, a former quarterback 
who played under Paterno in 1965 and 1966. 
</P>
<P>
They chatted for a while, and Paterno learned that Jack is a dentist in San 
Diego. They talked a little more and, while discussing their families, White 
mentioned that he has a son who played high school football and will graduate 
this May. 
</P>
<P>
He is Dan White of Point Loma, and he just so happens to have been the 
top-rated quarterback in San Diego County, passing for 3,169 yards this past 
season. He also happened to be The Times' back of the year. 
</P>
<P>
So, uh, guess Paterno slammed down the telephone and drove straight to White's 
house ready with a recruiting pitch? 
</P>
<P>
Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
Oh, Paterno said he probably will talk with White and his son while he's in 
town. But to recruit him? Doubtful. 
</P>
<P>
"I just don't think it's right," Paterno said. "I'm just not sure a kid should 
come that far away from home unless there are very special circumstances, like 
he has family back east or we have some courses that aren't available 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd feel awful to have a kid come so far and be homesick." 
</P>
<P>
This is why if you look at your program Friday night, you'll notice there are 
no California kids on the roster. In fact, there are only two from west of the 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State, adorned with its black shoes, nameless uniforms and plain helmets, 
simply is not for everyone. The campus is located two hours away from the 
nearest major airport in Harrisburg and it's about a three-hour drive to either 
Philadelphia or Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it takes a special kid to come to Penn State," Phillips said, "and Joe 
knows this. He has a special knack of knowing what kids will fit in and what 
ones won't. Very seldom is he ever wrong on a kid." 
</P>
<P>
It's a great attribute, naturally, when a coach can project the ability of a 
high school player in college, but it's much more difficult than that for 
Paterno. Playing football is not enough. He wants a diploma to go along with 
it. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think any of us are smarter than any other team's players," said 
junior fullback Leroy Thompson, "but I think we work harder. Coach Paterno 
makes sure we're going to those classes. If we have a big test coming up or 
something, he'll even give us a day off or two. 
</P>
<P>
"I came close to going to Miami. Out of high school, that's where I thought I'd 
go. Once I saw the ocean, I just fell in love with the place. 
</P>
<P>
"But during my visit, it was strange. They never talked about academics the 
whole time I was there, just football. 
</P>
<P>
"Now, when Coach Paterno came to see me, he didn't even talk about football. In 
fact, he hardly even talked to me. I just sat back while he talked with my 
parents, brother and sister. He said, 'I'll talk to you later.' 
</P>
<P>
"I came back, and they were all playing cards together. I guess I knew then 
where I was going." 
</P>
<P>
There's actually one player on the Penn State roster, one Paterno didn't want 
to embarrass by identifying, who had to do book reports before Paterno gave him 
a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
"He came from a tough inner-city school," Paterno said. "He had the grades in 
high school, but the English fundamentals were not there. I wanted him to start 
reading." 
</P>
<P>
So, every two weeks, the player would read a book, write a book report and mail 
it to Paterno's wife, Sue. Once he got to college, Sue continued working with 
him in English while David, Paterno's son, tutored him in math. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of these kids have good minds, they just don't use them," Paterno said. 
"Colleges are starting to make a big deal out of the graduation rate, but that 
can be overblown too. What good is a college education if you can't write a 
letter or discuss politics?" 
</P>
<P>
This is why when someone asks Paterno which team was the best he ever coached, 
the response will always be the same: "That will be determined by what those 
players contributed to society." 
</P>
<P>
It's also why Paterno remains humble in discussing his coaching feats. He 
acknowledges that he's not the same coach as he was 20 years ago, when he 
called every offensive and defensive play. But he says he's much-improved from 
a year ago, when he says he allowed outside activities to detract from his time 
from the football field. 
</P>
<P>
"I actually did more harm than good, just being around," Paterno said. "My 
staff would have meetings and decide on something, and I'd put my two cents in 
and throw everything out of whack. 
</P>
<P>
"I deserved the kind of season we had." 
</P>
<P>
How foolish, he now says, he was for leaving the first week of practice to 
attend the Republican National Convention in New Orleans, where he seconded the 
nomination of George Bush. How silly he was to devote most of his week to being 
the driving force behind the college's campaign fund. How wrong he was to 
delegate all of the authority to his assistants and expect success on the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
He was awakened with a cold slap in the face when the Penn State season ended 
in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
For the first time in 50 years, Penn State finished with a losing record -- 
5-6. 
</P>
<P>
Paterno thought a while about quitting, thinking perhaps he might have outlived 
his usefulness. Then he realized that he'd be quitting the program he so long 
has loved and decided that there's no way he's going to leave Penn State in any 
condition that's less than ideal. 
</P>
<P>
So he went back to the midnight film sessions. He put his his 165-pound body on 
that blocking sled. And he stuck that whistle back in his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
Penn State lost its season-opener to Virginia, 14-6, but lost just two more 
games the rest of the season, finishing 7-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
It was not a vintage Penn State season by any means, but, as Paterno will tell 
you, it's the beginning of a new era. 
</P>
<P>
He has told his freshman players that he'll remain with them throughout their 
collegiate eligibility and, although he can not make any promises, he'll let 
them know that since he took over at Penn State, every player completing his 
eligibility has . . . 
</P>
<P>
* . . . played on a team that won the national championship; 
</P>
<P>
* . . . played on a team that had an undefeated season; 
</P>
<P>
* . . . played in a bowl game for the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
"It'd be nice to go out with another national championship," Paterno said, "but 
I'm not even thinking of that scenario. If I don't win another national 
championship, it doesn't mean I'm not a success. It doesn't mean a thing. I've 
enjoyed it, and I'm going to keep enjoying it. 
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is going to change that, as long as I can help it." 
</P>
<P>
</P>

NORTH'S LAURA COLLINS SCORES WITH A SCHOLARSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART MATTHEWS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all of her high school career, Laura Collins has seemingly played under a 
shadow that stretched all the way from Inglewood to Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
It's not because Collins, North Torrance High's 6-foot center, can't shoot the 
basketball. She's averaging 29 points per game this season. 
</P>
<P>
She can also crash the boards, averaging 13 rebounds per game. 
</P>
<P>
She's been North's best player for four years, and with numbers like the ones 
above, you'd probably figure Collins is also the best player in her league. 
</P>
<P>
Well, maybe in another league. 
</P>
<P>
When people think of the Ocean League, they just naturally think of Morningside 
6-5 senior center Lisa Leslie and her teammate, 6-4 sophomore forward Janet 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
Which brings us back to that shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to become overshadowed by being in a league with players like that," 
Collins said. "But I don't feel I've been damaged at all. I have my own talents 
and I have shown what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
Although Leslie and Davis have grabbed most of the publicity and awards, 
Collins has what neither of her rivals have at the moment: a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
Collins signed early with UCLA, choosing the Bruins over UC Berkeley and Cal 
State Long Beach. She also took recruiting trips to Arizona State and San Diego 
State. 
</P>
<P>
"It seemed like the best time to make my decision," Collins said. "The 
recruiting process was becoming very hectic, and I wasn't waiting to hear from 
anybody else. I had heard from basically every school I wanted to hear from." 
</P>
<P>
Next year, Collins will join UCLA center Molly Tideback, a sophomore this 
season, in the front court at Pauley Pavilion. But for now, Collins isn't 
looking any further than Wednesday's league opener against Morningside, the 
defending state champion. 
</P>
<P>
Collins will be looking across the court at Davis, a teammate of Collins' on 
John Anderson's Carson-based South Bay team in last summer's Olympic Girls 
Development League. 
</P>
<P>
Then there's Leslie. The last time North and Morningside met, Leslie scored 37 
points against a defense that double-teamed her most of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to guard her because she's so much taller than everybody else," 
Collins said. "But she's not extremely strong. I try to use my strength against 
her height and push her out farther than she wants to go. I'm also quicker than 
she is, so she'll have to contend with that." 
</P>
<P>
North Coach Richard Rosato prefers to run a controlled, half-court offense that 
rotates the ball around the perimeter until Collins gets open, shuttling back 
and forth across between the high and low posts. 
</P>
<P>
It's a testimony to Collins' dominance inside the key that North's second 
highest scorer, forward Carolyn Hiramoto, is averaging under 10 points per 
game. Guards Stacy Onomura and Lori Delapina know their job -- get the ball 
inside to Collins. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura's a strong kid," Rosato said. "She's obviously our leader." 
</P>
<P>
For the most part, the offense has been successful. North reached the 
quarterfinals of the Southern Section playoffs last year with Collins in the 
middle before losing to Mission Viejo,60-59, on a shot at the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
This season, the Saxons are 6-1, having swept through the Beverly Hills 
Tournament before Christmas en route to a 70-56 victory over Estancia in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Collins, the tournament's most valuable player, scored 24 points and pulled 
down 13 rebounds in the title game. The Saxons are playing in the Costa Mesa 
Tournament this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"Laura does a nice job of getting herself open and does a nice job on the 
offensive boards," said Dan Hansen, Saxon assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
On the summer team, Collins played the high post in a run-and-gun offense, so 
most of her shots came in the 15-to-20-foot range. 
</P>
<P>
She also learned how to handle the ball better in an up-tempo, fast-breaking 
transition offense. 
</P>
<P>
"If the tempo dictates it, she can adapt her game," Hansen said. "If the tempo 
is upbeat, she goes upbeat. If it's aggressive, she goes aggressive. If it's 
finesse, she goes for the finesse." 
</P>
<P>
The game Wednesday will probably turn into a wide-open affair. Leslie, Davis 
and the rest of the Morningside team like the running game, and they're likely 
to turn the offense up a few notches against Collins and North. 
</P>
<P>
Collins is ready for a reunion with her shadow. 
</P>
<P>
"They're the ones to beat," she said. "They're the ones with the No. 1 ranking. 
The pressure is on them to keep it."

PEOPLE: WILSON QUITS AS DISNEY CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Gary L. Wilson has stepped aside as chief financial officer of Walt Disney Co. 
but remains with the company as an adviser. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has been a key player on the senior management team that took over 
Disney in September, 1984, after the entertainment giant fought off two 
takeover attempts. He has been credited with helping to engineer the financing 
that has allowed Disney to grow at a rapid pace during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the management change contributed to a sharp fall in 
Disney's already weak stock. Disney, one of the most active issues on the New 
York Stock Exchange Wednesday, fell $4.50 to $109.25 a share. The stock traded 
as high as $136.25 earlier this year, when it was buoyed by takeover 
speculation. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts called the stock fall an overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
"I still think the company will have a tremendous growth story over the next 
couple of years," said Andrew Wallach, an entertainment analyst with Drexel 
Burnham Lambert Inc. 
</P>
<P>
Judson Green, who has been chief financial officer of Euro Disneyland SCA, 
succeeds Wilson as Disney's chief financial officer. Lawrence P. Murphy, senior 
vice president-strategy and development, will also assume some of Wilson's 
operating responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson, who has signed a five-year contract with Disney, said he would continue 
to be involved with planning Disney's future. 
</P>
<P>
"This has kind of been evolving over the past year or so," Wilson said in a 
telephone interview from Colorado, where he was on a skiing vacation with 
Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
"I will continue to be very focused on the strategic and financial side," he 
said. "The younger guys will have a chance to operate." Wilson will turn 50 
next month. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would focus on seeking out major acquisitions. "We've done a lot of 
technical acquisitions that have been very good for the company," he said. "But 
we haven't done any major acquisitions, which I would consider over $1 billion, 
because the prices have been too high." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said he expected acquisition prices to fall in the coming decade but 
declined to detail what areas are drawing Disney's attention. 
</P>
<P>
Disney operates theme parks, makes movies and recently formed a new independent 
record label, Hollywood Records.

HOMOSEXUAL CATHOLICS WHO KEEP THE FAITH AND LIFE STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
RELIGION: WORSHIPERS STRUGGLE TO REMAIN PART OF A CHURCH WHOSE LEADERS DO NOT 
CONDONE THEIR ACTIVITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The issue is the Roman Catholic Church's views on homosexuality and AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On one side is the Church hierarchy. Los Angeles Archbishop Roger Mahony has 
banned priests from saying Mass for an organization of gay and lesbian 
Catholics, condemned a San Fernando High School health clinic program for gay 
teen-agers and declared that chastity, rather than the use of condoms, is the 
only "morally correct and medically secure way" to prevent the spread of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
On the other side are politically active gay and Lesbian Catholics who 
demonstrate against church officialdom, maintaining that they should be 
included in church activities and that "safe sex" is medically and morally 
sound. This month the issue heated up when an underground group of dissenters 
defaced four Los Angeles County churches and distributed posters declaring 
Mahony to be a murderer. 
</P>
<P>
Stuck in the middle are the practicing gay and lesbian Catholics who are not 
actively protesting and who do not wish to give up their association with the 
church. 
</P>
<P>
"At times you feel sort of like an undercover agent," said Rick, who lives in 
the Thousand Oaks area and did not, like most of the gay Catholics interviewed 
for this article, want his last name to be printed. He attends Mass at his 
local church every Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Rick used to belong to Dignity, a national organization with about 5,000 
members that sponsors Masses for gay men and lesbians. Last year, Mahony 
followed the lead of church officials in other parts of the country by banning 
Dignity from holding services in church facilities. Then, in June, he declared 
that priests could not administer Mass to Dignity groups in any venue. Rick's 
local chapter of Dignity disbanded. 
</P>
<P>
"I left the church for a while in anger but I found that my life was just 
generally miserable," Rick said. "I felt the lack of religion in my life." 
</P>
<P>
Rick tried associating with Protestant groups that welcomed homosexuals, but he 
did not find them fulfilling. "I don't want to put down those ministers in any 
way," he said, "but it just was not a Catholic organization. That's what I, 
personally, needed." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles chapter of Dignity still exists and holds meetings at several 
locations, including St. Matthew's Lutheran Church in North Hollywood. Indeed, 
the Los Angeles chapter celebrates Mass every Sunday, often with a priest 
willing to defy Mahony's directive. 
</P>
<P>
"We know priests who are still willing to come and do Mass for us," said Jack 
Stafford, president of the Los Angeles chapter of Dignity, which he said has a 
membership of about 200. "And if we can't get one for a particular Sunday, a 
para-liturgy is done. It's a Mass without a priest, like what is done in areas 
where there are priestless congregations." 
</P>
<P>
But their defiance goes only so far. Stafford said he does not know anyone in 
the underground group, which calls itself Greater Religious Responsibility, 
that took credit for spattered red paint on four area churches, including St. 
Charles Church of North Hollywood, in the early hours of Dec. 3, the first 
Sunday of Advent. 
</P>
<P>
"I had never even heard of that group before all this happened," Stafford said. 
"I understand why it has come to this. When people feel adamant about an issue 
and do not feel they are being effective by expressing themselves in words, 
they sometimes turn to the kind of acts that occurred." 
</P>
<P>
While he understands the motivation behind GRR's actions, he vehemently 
disagrees with them. "What they did was not effective at all," he said. "It 
will not get the church to listen. Just the opposite. It is not going to give 
us a positive image. 
</P>
<P>
"I am against all acts of violence, and I consider what they did to be 
violence, violence against the church and the community. It was an act of 
intolerance, and intolerance just breeds intolerance." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy, a member of a Los Angeles Dignity offshoot called Lesbian Catholics 
Together, is more sympathetic to GRR. "This archbishop has done nothing for 
lesbians and very little for Catholic women in general," she said. "The biggest 
problem is that he is spreading such misinformation. It makes it especially 
difficult for young people just coming out." 
</P>
<P>
But Sandy, 47, who lives in North Hollywood, has also chosen to stay in the 
church. "We have taught ourselves that we are the church," she said. "It's not 
some bureaucratic group of men who make pronouncements. It's people like us. We 
consider ourselves cultural Catholics, and it would be hard for us to leave, no 
matter how conservative the edicts are." 
</P>
<P>
Lesbian Catholics Together meets once a month in members' homes. Sandy said the 
group, which has about 25 active members, can usually find a sympathetic priest 
to say Mass. 
</P>
<P>
"It is almost like in the early church when they met in people's homes in 
secret," she said with a laugh. "But we find that it is important to get 
together. We are a support to each other emotionally and we share our 
spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
It's not spirituality but sexuality that disturbs the church when it comes to 
homosexuals. In his statement banning priests from celebrating Masses sponsored 
by Dignity, Mahony reiterated the official church position that "while . . . 
homosexual orientation in itself is not to be regarded as a sinful condition . 
. . genital activity by unmarried persons, or by married persons without being 
open to procreation, is morally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"I don't follow the church's edicts in that respect any more than some of the 
priests do not," Rick said, angrily. "I have had a monogamous, loving 
relationship with a man for eight years and we care about each other in a very 
special way." 
</P>
<P>
Rick met the man he lives with at a Dignity mass in Ventura County, before that 
group dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
"We go to church together every Sunday now, just like any other couple." 
</P>
<P>
Except that in the church they do not acknowledge to other worshipers that they 
are a couple. "I guess that there are some places where you cannot be the 
person you want to be," Rick said. "I needed the church and I needed to get on 
with my life, so this is what I do. It's unfortunate. You want the church to be 
a place of warmth and understanding for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
He does not "confess" to homosexual acts to his priest. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried that once, a long time ago," he said. "It was with an older priest. I 
hardly started talking about it and he said, 'You don't want to be doing that.' 
Then he absolved me from my sins and I was out of there before I hardly knew 
what happened. It was not a good experience." 
</P>
<P>
Sandy and her lover also go to church together on occasion. "We used to live in 
Tarzana, and in that parish we were pretty much known as a lesbian couple," she 
said. "But where we are now, it hasn't really come up." 
</P>
<P>
Eventually, if the arguments about homosexuality and the church continue to 
heat up, she said, she might feel compelled to go more public with her views. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if someone said something I really disagreed with, something I found I 
could not just let go, I would speak out. I would have to do something." 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Stafford advises patience. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do a lot more from inside the church than those who deface it," he 
said. "Our time of acceptance will come. This archbishop and this Pope do not 
listen to us a lot, now. But they are not in there forever. There will be 
others."

ARIZONA HOTEL EXEMPLIFIES LINCOLN S&amp;L'S EXTRAVAGANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What's bizarre about the upper-class Phoenician Hotel here is that everything 
appears so normal. 
</P>
<P>
Nestled at the base of Camelback Mountain, a Phoenix-area landmark, the hotel 
reeks of elegance and money, from its $25-million art collection to afternoon 
teas that are served in the marble-floored main lobby. Daily fact sheets 
provide each guest with weather reports and hotel activities. 
</P>
<P>
The still waters are deceptive. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenician is the erstwhile crown jewel of Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
controversial Phoenix businessman who stands as the center of the storm over 
the massive taxpayer bailout of the savings and loan industry. 
</P>
<P>
Financed by Keating's Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan in Irvine, the hotel 
represents one of the excesses of the thrift industry in the 1980s, a period 
when many thrifts went from mortgage lender to real estate developer, often 
with poor results. 
</P>
<P>
Although many in Phoenix rave about the resort's beauty and style, some hotel 
consultants believe that the Phoenician is a financial white elephant doomed to 
unprofitability because it was far too expensive to build. The complex cost 
almost $300 million, government figures show. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel, which has more than 600 rooms on 130 acres, would have to charge 
about $500 a night to make money, according to estimates by Richard A. Warnick, 
partner in the Phoenix office of Laventhol &amp; Horwath, an accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
That's more than three times the average room rate in the luxury hotel market 
in the Phoenix area. "At that price, they won't make money in my lifetime, and 
I'm not that old," said Warnick, who is in his early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
Keating disputed that reasoning, however, saying in an interview that the 
outside consultants were "absolutely dead wrong." He maintained that the hotel 
was already making enough money to pay its operating expenses and had potential 
for great profit if sold in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
Keating's real estate and banking empire collapsed in 1989 after years of 
bitter feuding with the bureaucrats who regulate the nation's thrift industry. 
Keating's development company sought refuge in bankruptcy court, and Lincoln 
Savings was seized by government savings and loan regulators as part of what's 
expected to be the costliest thrift failure in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
Federal agents delivered the final indignity Nov. 16, when they ousted Keating 
and his cohorts from management of the hotel during a pre-dawn raid that was 
barely noticed by the guests. 
</P>
<P>
Government regulators are now faced with the formidable task of finding a buyer 
for the hotel. One possible acquirer is the Kuwait Investment Office, which 
already has a 45% interest in the property. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel was plagued by building revisions and luxurious excesses that added 
millions of dollars to its eventual cost, according to those familiar with its 
construction. The building changes were usually mandated by Keating and his 
wife. 
</P>
<P>
But the early evidence also indicates that the hotel has fallen on hard times 
since Keating was removed. During one three-day stretch in early December, the 
Phoenician seemed uncommonly empty during the normally busy tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's new government-installed manager, Hans D. Turnovszky, confirmed 
that the hotel had an occupancy rate of only 50% to 55% early this month, and 
angry Keating loyalists say the hotel has sustained widespread cancellations 
since the government seizure. The resort was 95% occupied at the time of the 
raid, regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
"I have good sources who tell me that November was way below expectations, and 
December looks just as bad," said Bradley J. Boland, a Keating spokesman and 
son-in-law. He added that "1990 looks bad because no one wants to stay in a 
government-owned hotel." 
</P>
<P>
Keating, who is seeking to regain control of the Phoenician through litigation, 
argues that he could have eventually sold the resort for a profit of several 
hundred million dollars if he had been allowed to finish his plans to expand 
the resort to more than 850 rooms. 
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview earlier this week, the 65-year-old developer said he 
also had plans to bolster the hotel's finances by selling some of the 
surrounding property for real estate development. 
</P>
<P>
Those moves would have increased the Phoenician's value and made it more 
attractive to potential investors, particularly those from Japan who recently 
have paid princely sums for luxurious resort properties in the United States, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That resort was built to be sold," said Keating, who also maintained that the 
hotel cost only $275 million, not $296 million as banking regulators contend. 
</P>
<P>
Regulators who supervised the investments of Lincoln Savings viewed the 
Phoenician with alarm in its early stages of development, but their concerns 
ebbed somewhat later on. The hotel was not a major contributor to the collapse 
of Lincoln, which was seized because of risky loans and questionable 
investments in other real estate development projects. 
</P>
<P>
Several months before the hotel opened, regulators placed the Phoenician on a 
special watch list, but they did not require Lincoln Savings to write off any 
value in the project, according to regulatory records that are now part of a 
lawsuit between Keating and the government. 
</P>
<P>
In late 1986, Laventhol &amp; Horwath estimated that the hotel was worth only 
about $200 million if it had an occupancy rate of 70%. But regulators later 
agreed the property had a market value of $297 million after the Kuwait 
Investment Office (KIO) paid $134 million for its minority stake in the 
property, the regulatory records show. 
</P>
<P>
The KIO, based in London, is an arm of the Kuwait Finance Ministry that invests 
in real estate and hotels worldwide. Officials of the agency could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The Phoenician was a very personal undertaking for Keating, who closely 
supervised its construction. His wife, Mary Elaine, designed the hotel interior 
after the firing of several professional interior designers. 
</P>
<P>
The family stamp is all over the grounds. One restaurant is named Mary 
Elaine's, and a nightclub is known as Charlie Charlie's. A crucifixion scene 
along a golf-cart trail behind the hotel is an apparent reflection of Keating's 
deep religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
Joe Gilbreath, general manager of a Phoenix firm that performed glass work at 
the Phoenician, recalled that Keating lived at the hotel in the two months 
prior to its Oct. 1, 1988, opening. "He was roaming around the place like a 
guard dog 20 hours a day," Gilbreath said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, construction was plagued by costly changes. Gilbreath said 
Keating once ordered him to encase one marble stairway in glass, a job that 
cost more than $25,000, then ordered him to tear it down when he didn't like 
the look. 
</P>
<P>
"There were well over 1,000 change orders," Gilbreath said. "I've been in (the 
construction) business for 31 years, and I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
The history of the Phoenician goes back to the late 1970s, when Canadian 
investors leased the land around the historic Jokake Inn, once the home of 
artist Jessie Benton Evans. 
</P>
<P>
The inn, turned into a tearoom that took overnight visitors, was once a 
fashionable resting spot for famous winter tourists such as the Astors and 
Rockefellers. But its glory days were over by the 1970s, and it closed in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
The Canadian investors planned to build a hotel known as the Four Seasons 
Phoenician Hotel, but they sold the leases in 1984 because American 
Continental, Keating's development firm, "made us an offer we couldn't refuse," 
one investor said. 
</P>
<P>
Construction of the Phoenician was a massive and turbulent undertaking. 
</P>
<P>
Keating quarreled loudly with Phoenix city officials over how much water could 
be used on the property for the golf course, swimming pools, and decorative 
lakes and ponds. Delays caused by the fights were a "perfect example of how to 
bankrupt a developer," Keating charged at a news conference in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is also entangled in messy litigation over unpaid bills. Dozens of 
subcontractors claim that they are still owed about $13 million, but they have 
yet to be paid because of a continuing dispute between the hotel and the 
general contractor. 
</P>
<P>
What eventually happens to the Phoenician depends largely on bureaucrats such 
as Anthony Scalzi, western region head of the Resolution Trust Corp., the 
government agency created this year to liquidate the assets of failed savings 
and loans. 
</P>
<P>
Scalzi confirmed that the Phoenician may eventually be sold to the Kuwaitis, 
but he also suggested that the bargaining would not be easy. "There is a 
chance" of a sale, he said in a recent interview, "but we are not going to give 
it away."

BIG AIRLINES JOIN 'MINI FARE WAR,' CUT TICKET PRICES; 
</P>
<P>
TRAVEL: TINY MIDWAY AIRLINES OF CHICAGO FIRED THE FIRST VOLLEY IN AN APPARENT 
EFFORT TO FILL SEATS DURING A SLOW PERIOD. UNITED, TWA, DELTA AND NORTHWEST 
HAVE FOLLOWED SUIT.

Many major airlines Wednesday cut their fares for the first part of the year in 
what some observers say is the start of a mini fare war designed to fill empty 
seats during the traditionally slow winter season. 
</P>
<P>
The reductions are aimed at the leisure traveler who is able to make plans well 
in advance. Fares for cities in the Sun Belt -- where travel is always busy in 
the winter -- were excepted. They include Florida, Arizona, Nevada and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
Generally, the tickets must be purchased by Jan. 31 and travel must be 
completed by March 6. Tickets must be purchased 14 days in advance and 24 hours 
after reservations have been made. The fares are non-refundable and require a 
Saturday night stay. The reductions apply on a round-trip basis only. 
</P>
<P>
The fare action apparently was triggered Tuesday by tiny Chicago-based Midway 
Airlines. It had announced one-way fares ranging from $19 to $99 on its 50-city 
system. Midway cut its Chicago-Los Angeles round-trip fare to $198 from $318. 
United Airlines, Trans World Airlines, Northwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines 
all took similar action. 
</P>
<P>
Trans World Airlines, for example, said late Wednesday that its fares would be 
reduced on about 80% of its 85 domestic destinations. The ticket prices will 
vary according to the mileage flown and the days on which travel takes place. 
</P>
<P>
"We have initiated a sale similar to one which which we instituted last August 
and which was very successful," said Don Morrison, a TWA spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
TWA, for example, said the lowest round-trip fares for travel Tuesday through 
Friday will start at $178 for flights up to 1,000 miles, $238 for flights of up 
to 2,000 miles and $278 for flights over 2,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Round-trip fares between New York City and Los Angeles would drop to $278 from 
$398. Tickets between Chicago and Los Angeles would be $238 from $338. 
</P>
<P>
United said its new round-trip fares for flights of up to 1,000 miles would be 
$198 for peak periods and $178 for off-peak times. Peak times are Saturdays, 
Sundays and Mondays. For flights of 1,000 to 2,000 miles, fares will range from 
$238 to $258. For flights longer than 2,000, the fares will be $278 and $318. 
</P>
<P>
United said it was reducing its fares to compete with direct-mail promotions by 
other carriers, including coupons that can be redeemed for air travel at fares 
"well below prevailing levels." 
</P>
<P>
"The reductions are significant because they encompass a lot of East-West 
routes and that is a major portion of travel in the United States," said 
Timothy Pettee, an airline analyst with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; 
Smith, a New York broker. "If not many people take advantage of the fares then 
the airlines will begin to drop their restrictions, and if the restrictions 
fall, there could be a damaging fare war." 
</P>
<P>
But John W. Mattis, airline analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton, another New 
York brokerage, said he doesn't think that the reductions are all that 
important. 
</P>
<P>
"It is nothing more than a seasonal mini fare war which tends to occur every 
year at this time," he said. "It is an effort to fill empty seats in a slow 
season. I also wonder how many seats they will devote to the lower fares and 
how they compare with similar reductions which were instituted last year at 
this time." 
</P>
<P>
Separately Wednesday, Trump Shuttle told travel agents that it was raising 
fares to $119 one way from $99 on weekdays and to $79 from $69 on weekends, 
agents said. Trump Shuttle officials couldn't be reached for comment. But Pan 
Am Corp. spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said that firm's shuttle service, which 
competes with Trump's, was matching the increase, effective Jan. 3. The 
shuttles link New York with Boston and Washington.

THOUGH OTHER RATES HAVE FALLEN, PRIME IS STUBBORNLY HIGH 
</P>

<P>
When the nation's economy slows, the Federal Reserve Board eases credit and 
banks help rekindle business activity by lowering the interest rates they 
charge for loans. 
</P>
<P>
So goes a classic scenario. But this year there's been a hitch, for banks have 
been unusually tardy in lowering their prime lending rate, to the surprise of 
economists and the dismay of some borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
By most rules of thumb, "the prime should have come down weeks ago," said David 
M. Jones, chief economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a big government 
securities dealer in New York. "But in a year of bad real estate loans and bad 
loans to developing countries, they must feel they've got reason to maximize 
profits." 
</P>
<P>
The prime rate is the basis for many fixed- and variable-rate loans to small 
and medium-sized businesses and to consumers. Banks have historically been 
quick to raise the prime when their borrowing costs are rising and slow to 
lower it when their borrowing costs decline. 
</P>
<P>
The longer they delay in lowering it, of course, the more they pad their 
profits. And this year, they have been slower than usual, analysts agree. 
</P>
<P>
The prime has declined from a peak of 11.5% last spring to 11% in June and to 
its current 10.5% in August. But since then it has not budged. In early 
November, one bank, Southwest Bank of St. Louis, cut its rate to 10%. Three 
weeks later, however, Southwest raised it back again. 
</P>
<P>
Economists predicted on Wednesday that with recent signs of easing by the Fed, 
the prime could finally fall as early as next week or at least sometime during 
the first quarter of next year. 
</P>
<P>
These economists expressed surprise that banks have not moved since last week, 
when the Fed signaled a further easing of credit by allowing the widely watched 
federal funds rate to fall to 8.25% from 8.5%. The federal funds rate is what 
banks charge each other for overnight loans. 
</P>
<P>
By convention, banks lower the prime when it is more than 1.5 percentage points 
higher than their cost of borrowing. The banks' borrowing costs -- as measured 
by the rates they pay on 3-month certificates of deposit -- are now between 
8.25% and 8.5%. That's a generous 2 to 2.25 percentage points below the prime. 
</P>
<P>
"The banks feel they can keep the prime up, give special rates to their best 
customers and keep up their net interest (profit) margins while holding on to 
their market share," said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist with First Fidelity 
Bancorporation, parent of Philadelphia's Fidelity Bank. 
</P>
<P>
The preferred customers who receive the preferential rates are businesses. But 
consumers, who receive no such breaks, are likely to face the full brunt of the 
higher prime, Levy acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
And by keeping the prime relatively high at year's end, banks will help 
themselves in 1990 because interest rates on some adjustable consumer loans 
next year will be based on where rates will stand at the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
The banks' eagerness to keep the rate high is understandable. Weakening real 
estate in the Northeast, Arizona and other areas has forced writedowns of loans 
and other defensive moves at such institutions as Bank of New England, First 
Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles and Chase Manhattan Bank. Other prominent 
lenders, such as Manufacturers Hanover in New York, are still suffering the 
effects of soured loans to less developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, the nation's banks as a group lost $744 million because 
of shaky loans on real estate and to developing countries. In the first half of 
the year, by contrast, the banks earned record profits. 
</P>
<P>
Ken Ackbarali, an economist with First Interstate Bank in Los Angeles, said the 
gap between the banks' borrowing costs and the prime actually peaked in the 
spring, when the prime rate began edging downward. At some points in June and 
July, the prime was as much as 2.35 percentage points above the banks' costs -- 
higher than it has been "for several years," Ackbarali said. 
</P>
<P>
Economists suggested several other reasons for banks' reluctance to cut the 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
The Fed has lowered rates extremely slowly this year because of its concern 
about inflation, which continues at an annual rate of about 4.5%. "You actually 
couldn't reduce rates much slower than they have," said S. Jay Levy of Levy 
Economic Forecasters in Chappaqua, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, "banks have been uncertain on the direction of short-term rates," 
said Ackbarali. 
</P>
<P>
Economist Jones said the prime's "stickiness" may also be due to the fact that 
it is no longer the kind of rate it once was. While the prime was for many 
years the basis for loans to banks' best corporate customers, it is 
increasingly the yardstick for consumer loans, such as auto loans and home 
equity loans. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, banks may regard the prime increasingly as a rate that fluctuates 
little, like rates on credit cards and many auto loans, Jones said.

Sears Credit Rating Downgraded: Duff &amp; Phelps Inc. said it downgraded its 
credit rating of Sears, Roebuck and Co.'s debt securities because of 
uncertainty over the success of Sears' new retailing strategy. Duff &amp; 
Phelps downgraded Sears' senior debt, acceptance senior debt and Discover Card 
credit senior debt to AA-minus from AA. At the same time, the credit-rating 
company reaffirmed the rating that it gave Sears' commercial paper, Duff 
1-plus. The downgrading affects about $2 billion of debt securities. Duff &amp; 
Phelps said the downgrading reflected the "increased risks and earnings 
volatility" of Sears' retail operations after its switch last spring to a 
strategy of "everyday low pricing."

HUGHES ADMITS FAILURE OF PART CITED IN ENGINEER'S SUIT; 
</P>
<P>
AEROSPACE: THE DEFENSE FIRM SAID A TEST TORPEDO MALFUNCTIONED. THE FORMER 
EMPLOYEE SUING THE FIRM SAID HE HAS BEEN THREATENED.

Hughes Aircraft Co. conceded Wednesday that defective microchips caused the 
failure of at least one test torpedo that was part of a system scheduled to be 
installed in Navy submarines next year. 
</P>
<P>
The admission came after a former staff engineer at Hughes' Ground Systems 
Group in Fullerton, who has filed a $9.6-billion whistle-blower lawsuit against 
the defense giant, released an internal company memo that supports his 
contention that Hughes used millions of defective chips that could endanger the 
nation's defense system. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Denlinger filed suit in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana in June, 
alleging that Hughes covered up flaws in 4.75 million microchips installed in 
defense systems. The former senior staff engineer's lawsuit was unsealed 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hughes characterized his allegations as erroneous. The company said 
it was unaware of any system failures that had occurred as a result of 
defective chips described by Denlinger. 
</P>
<P>
But on Wednesday, Denlinger held a 90-minute news conference to outline his 
five-year battle with Hughes. He released an inch-thick stack of documents 
backing up his case. Among the documents was a Hughes memo dated Sept. 28, 
1988, saying that an advanced capability torpedo had failed during a test 
because of a cracked chip. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes confirmed the contents of the memo. The company said it had been unable 
to thoroughly check Denlinger's claim of a torpedo failure on Tuesday because 
of a companywide holiday. Hughes continues to deny charges that it covered up 
flaws in microchips. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger said at his news conference that he has been in hiding in Northern 
California since he resigned from Hughes in January because of what he said 
were repeated threats against his life. On hand were two Orange County 
sheriff's deputies and a private armed guard. 
</P>
<P>
"Our weapons systems have to be 100% reliable," Denlinger said. "If they fail 
at any critical moment, disaster can happen. Lives can be lost. That is why I 
persisted." 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger alleges that Hughes took a shortcut in its soldering methods during a 
five-year period in the middle and late 1980s, causing cracks in chips that 
were supposed to be airtight in order to prevent corrosion. 
</P>
<P>
Essentially, the chips were allegedly dipped almost whole into vats of solder 
-- what Hughes calls its tinning process. The process can cause the chips to 
crack if they are exposed to cleaning solvents or cold solutions immediately 
afterward. 
</P>
<P>
"You can take a glass and put it in an oven at 500 degrees Fahrenheit, and then 
you throw it in a sink of cold water and it cracks," Denlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
Hughes has said that its soldering procedures conformed with government 
specifications but that it was aware of an industrywide problem of microchip 
cracking. The company established two committees -- one in 1985 and another in 
1987 -- to study the issue. 
</P>
<P>
But Denlinger says in his suit that the committees' reports "contained certain 
gross inaccuracies known to be false by defendant Hughes." Executives there had 
"full knowledge that defective products would still be sold to the United 
States government," the suit adds. 
</P>
<P>
Among the documents released Wednesday was an internal memo dated Jan. 5, 1988, 
that says Hughes' inventory contained a "significant number" of defective 
chips. The report's authors concluded that "product reliability may be 
affected." They recommended that the tinning process be suspended. 
</P>
<P>
The documents released Wednesday by Denlinger's attorneys also show that 
General Dynamics Corp. issued an industrywide alert in 1986, warning of 
"catastrophic electrical failures" caused by microchips that were put through 
the tinning process. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger claims he made every effort to change what he thought was a flawed 
system at Hughes before deciding to sue the company under the federal False 
Claims Act, a 1986 law that divides any spoils between the complainant and the 
U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a conflict between my own code of professional ethics and the 
conduct of Hughes management," Denlinger said. He made comparisons to the space 
shuttle Challenger disaster, which resulted from a flawed part. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger said his repeated warnings, including written reports, were mostly 
ignored by management. "They swatted me away like a fly," Denlinger said. "I 
was a nuisance to them." 
</P>
<P>
Hughes spokesman Dan Reeder said Denlinger's opinion was simply different from 
his colleagues'. 
</P>
<P>
Denlinger said he went into seclusion early this year because he didn't want 
Hughes officials to be able to find him. He claims someone shot at him in early 
June when he was wading in a tide pool in Morro Bay. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, his attorneys sent a telegram to the Justice Department seeking 
protection for their client.

TELLER MACHINES GETTING A WORKOUT THIS DECEMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many people, trips to crowded shopping malls, airports or restaurants this 
holiday season weren't complete without a stop at an automated teller machine. 
</P>
<P>
Representatives of one of the world's largest ATM networks, Plus System Inc. of 
Denver, predicted that between Dec. 1 and New Year's Day consumers will use the 
bank machines twice as much as in the same period last year, largely for 
withdrawals. 
</P>
<P>
That's good news for many financial institutions, which charge anywhere from 10 
cents to $3 per transaction for such ATM services as cash withdrawals, 
deposits, transfers or balance inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
"Consumers have clearly embraced the idea of using ATMs. They've become more 
confident in technology," said D. Dale Browning, president of Plus System, 
which estimates that its ATM customers will withdraw more than $500 million 
during 6.5 million transactions this month. 
</P>
<P>
As ATMs have grown in number and in activity since their introduction more than 
a decade ago, the likelihood of fraud committed by and against consumers also 
has increased, especially during the holidays, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
"The potential for it to rise is there, just as credit card fraud rose as 
people started to use their cards more, and (thieves) became more aware of how 
they can beat the system," said Marsha Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Consumer 
Bankers Assn. in Arlington, Va. 
</P>
<P>
Few estimates are available on ATM-related losses. But some experts say it runs 
as high as $200 million a year and has the potential to move into the billions 
-- as it has in the credit card industry. 
</P>
<P>
Bank of America narrowly escaped $14 million in potential losses earlier this 
year after uncovering a scam in which several insiders planned to use stolen 
secret codes of ATM cardholders to withdraw money from 8,000 bank accounts. The 
group planned to carry out the scheme with bogus bank cards made of poster 
board. 
</P>
<P>
A recent survey by the Washington-based American Bankers Assn. found that 25% 
of the 1,200 banks polled reported cases of fraud committed by a customer. 
Thirteen percent reported fraud against a customer. 
</P>
<P>
The average financial institution had 62 cases of ATM fraud last year, or about 
one incident for every 28,070 transactions, according to another study by Bank 
Administration Institute of Rolling Meadows, Ill. That was down sharply from 
the 390 incidents reported in 1986, due largely to increased safeguards by 
banks.

HEATING OIL PRICES UP AGAIN

The price of heating oil jumped again Wednesday as bitterly cold weather 
continued to hover over much of the country, giving rise to concerns about 
transport problems and dwindling supplies. 
</P>
<P>
But oil traders said they saw signs that the rally was starting to weaken. 
</P>
<P>
Heating oil for January finished up a sharp 7.23 cents at 99.71 cents a gallon 
on the New York Mercantile Exchange after retreating from a session high of 100 
cents. The contract had surged 13% Tuesday, the first day of trading since a 
Christmas Eve explosion at an Exxon refinery in Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>
The February contract rose its expanded 3-cent daily limit to 73.89 cents on 
the Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
Most futures contracts have daily price limits to prevent panic buying or 
selling. After the February contract rose its 2-cent limit on Tuesday, the 
exchange expanded the range for Wednesday's session. 
</P>
<P>
The freezing weather not only raised demand for heating oil, but it also made 
it difficult to distribute supplies as barges became stranded in rivers that 
iced over. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, elected officials from states in the Northeast have asked the 
federal government to investigate skyrocketing home heating oil prices, 
including possible price manipulation. 
</P>
<P>
The price for a gallon of home heating oil has risen to as high as $1.62 from 
about 85 cents two weeks ago. As record cold gripped New England, prices in the 
region were routinely jumping 5 cents per gallon per day; in one instance, the 
jump was 12 cents.

HILL DESCRIBED AS ISSUE IN STATE SENATE RACE; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: AT LEAST FOUR HOPEFULS IN THE 31ST DISTRICT RACE AGREE THAT THE 
WHITTIER ASSEMBLYMAN'S TIES TO AN FBI PROBE OF INFLUENCE PEDDLING HAVE MADE 
ETHICS A CAMPAIGN MATTER.

One thing became clear as Tuesday ended the filing period for the special 
election to replace state Sen. William Campbell: Four candidates in the race 
have a common target. 
</P>
<P>
He is the fifth candidate -- Assemblyman Frank Hill (R-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights) abruptly left office earlier this month after 20 
years of elective office to become president of the California Manufacturers 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
Gov. George Deukmejian set a special Feb. 6 primary to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
As expected, Hill, Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), and Brea City 
Councilman Ron Isles will compete in the Republican primary. Democrat Janice 
Lynn Graham, who lost an election to Campbell, and El Toro attorney Thomas M. 
Whaling are the Democratic candidates. 
</P>
<P>
Other candidates who met Tuesday's filing deadline are Diamond Bar City 
Councilman Gary G. Miller, a Republican; West Covina Councilman Bradley J. 
McFadden, a Democrat, and Rowland Heights resident Robert W. Lewis, American 
Independent Party. 
</P>
<P>
The sprawling 31st Senate District straddles Los Angeles and Orange counties, 
stretching north to Whittier and south to Laguna Beach. Registered Republicans 
in the district outnumber Democrats 54% to 36%, and Ferguson and Hill are 
considered front-runners in the race. 
</P>
<P>
Hill, 35, is one of five elected state officials being investigated by the FBI 
in connection with influence peddling at the state Capitol. Hill's office was 
searched in the investigation, but no charges have been filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, 66, has blasted the governor and other Republican leaders in 
Sacramento for what he said was a Machiavellian plot to eliminate him from the 
race to leave the way clear for Hill. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Ferguson said: "I've already promised Hill I would not do anything 
to hurt his reputation." But the three-term assemblyman added, "I think the 
public knows that issue (the FBI investigation) already. It's a done deal. He's 
already shot himself in the foot, and it's not necessary for me to stomp on his 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson also reiterated his allegation that political interests may have been 
behind the decision to give the candidates just over a month to campaign. This 
expanded on his earlier charge that Hill supporters pushed Deukmejian to call a 
special election quickly so that Ferguson, who recently moved from Corona del 
Mar to Laguna Niguel, would not meet the residency requirement. 
</P>
<P>
However, Ferguson said he did not believe that there was complicity on the part 
of the governor and declined to say whether he thought Hill was directly behind 
the move. 
</P>
<P>
But Whaling, Isles and Graham all said Hill or his backers specifically asked 
the governor to call a quick election for Hill's benefit. 
</P>
<P>
"If they didn't go out and push him, people would wonder whether they really 
supported him," said Graham, a retired businesswoman and teacher from Laguna 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Isles, 51, who has also indicated that ethics could be a campaign issue, said 
Tuesday that Hill exerted pressure on influential backers in Sacramento -- 
including the governor -- to move up the special election and thus cut campaign 
time that could be used to focus on the corruption probe. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's a tremendous amount of loyalty in Sacramento among various 
legislators," Isles said. "I think Frank Hill has been an easy vote for most of 
those people, and I think he's calling in his chips." 
</P>
<P>
Whaling vowed not to mention specific shortcomings among the candidates during 
the campaign but added that "there's a real problem with Hill taking money in 
honorariums." 
</P>
<P>
"I intend to focus on the positive, but out of that comes a generalization 
about corruption," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Hill could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Gore, a Deukmejian spokesman, dismissed the allegations about the timing of 
the primary as "absolutely untrue." 
</P>
<P>
"The governor set the election without regard to any specific candidate," Gore 
said. "To my knowledge, none of the major Republican candidates even spoke to 
the governor." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell, 54, shocked colleagues in late October when he announced that he 
would leave elective office, then abruptly speeded up his departure in the 
middle of this month. He had recently drawn heavy criticism for leading a group 
of fellow state legislators on a junket to New York to meet with bond houses. 
The trip, which Campbell organized as chairman of the Joint Legislative Budget 
Committee, included trips to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Radio City Music 
Hall and a Broadway show, all at taxpayers' expense. 
</P>
<P>
Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp is closing a lengthy investigation into $165,000 
in consulting fees paid to Campbell's wife and a former aide for a 1987 
conference on women sponsored by Campbell's office. 
</P>
<P>
Tuesday, the candidates interviewed predicted that the potentially volatile 
race also will focus on campaign spending. 
</P>
<P>
Ferguson, who said he plans to spend about $350,000 on the campaign, said he 
expects Hill to spend about $600,000. Isles said he is willing to spend 
$500,000 of his own money. 
</P>
<P>
"It's the only way I can get in the ballgame," Isles said. "I don't have the 
insurance industry and the gambling interests and Pacific Telephone chipping in 
money to my campaign." He said he cited those industries because they have 
appeared on campaign contribution disclosures filed by Hill. 
</P>
<P>
Graham, who said she plans to spend about $100,000 on the campaign, and 
Whaling, who said he signed an affidavit Tuesday vowing not to spend more than 
$1,000, both called the campaign war chests of Hill, Isles and Ferguson 
"obscene." 
</P>
<P>
"They should be embarrassed to say they're going to spend that kind of money on 
a Senate race," Graham said. "Where do they get their money from? Who do they 
pander to?" 
</P>
<P>
Whaling said he planned to rely on press coverage to get his message across.

COMPTON OKS SALE OF LAND TO MACK TRUCK; 
</P>
<P>
REDEVELOPMENT: THE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES A DEAL I WHICH THE BUYER WOULD PAY 
FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR 6.9 ACRES.

<P>
A divided City Council agreed this week to sell land in the Compton Auto Plaza 
to a Mack Truck sales and service franchise, after rejecting an offer two weeks 
ago from the same firm. 
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the sale, which was accepted by the council at its meeting 
Tuesday, Universal Mack Truck Sales and Service Inc. will pay $2.8 million for 
6.9 acres at the north end of the auto mall, which is along the 91 Freeway. The 
company's new offer satisfied the demand by some council members that the city 
receive fair market value for the land. 
</P>
<P>
When the council rejected the company's first offer -- $3.7 million for about 
12 acres -- some council members said they would accept nothing less than the 
$4.7-million value established by city appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
Council members have said they do not intend to sell any more of the city's 
redevelopment land at discount prices, which is a common practice in cities 
that are competing for developers. 
</P>
<P>
Council members Maxcy Filer, Bernice Woods and Jane Robbins voted for the sale. 
Mayor Walter Tucker abstained. Councilwoman Patricia Moore voted against the 
sale. She has contended all along that the city ought to develop a new plan for 
the auto plaza land that would include other uses such as an entertainment 
center or an electronics mart. 
</P>
<P>
The company agreed to make a cash down payment of $1 million and pay the 
balance in monthly installments over the next 12 years. It guaranteed the city 
$500,000 a year in sales tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they can do (that much in sales) easily," said Filer, pointing out 
that the firm intends to move its Signal Hill and Los Angeles operations to 
Compton. "That's bringing in $500,000 where nothing is coming in now," Filer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The auto mall, which originally opened in 1978, has been a disappointment to 
the council, which has struggled to lure commercial developers to the 
economically depressed city. Over the years, dealerships closed their doors, 
defaulting on their mortgages and other city loans. 
</P>
<P>
Universal Mack plans to build a $2-million facility, which will serve as 
collateral for the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
The agreement with Universal Mack may signal the end of the South Central 
Organizing Committee campaign to build low-cost, owner-occupied housing in the 
auto plaza. Though the council has repeatedly said it would not use the 
commercial land for housing, the local political activist group continued to 
press the city for the land and recently offered $5 million for about 12 acres.

MOBIL SUES OVER SANTA FE SPRINGS' OIL WELL FIRE FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

SANTA FE SPRINGS 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mobil Oil Corp. has sued the city for relief from "costly" annual fire and oil 
well operating fees that are designated to clean up 500 deserted wells and pay 
for specialized fire services. 
</P>
<P>
Mobil claims that the fees -- a $1,885-per-well fire fee and a $1,000-per-well 
annual operating fee -- are unfair and illegal. Mobil does not need the city's 
specialized fire protection because it can provide its own and should not be 
held responsible for cleaning up other oil companies' deserted sumps, according 
to the suit and Mobil officials. 
</P>
<P>
"The fees grossly exceed any benefit" Mobil will receive, according to the suit 
filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Mobil claims in its suit that it 
was unfairly singled out to pay the "vast bulk" of the fees. Mobil owns 304 of 
the 400 operating oil wells in Santa Fe Springs. Independent companies own most 
of the remaining wells. 
</P>
<P>
City officials deny singling out Mobil, and say the fees are justified. 
</P>
<P>
Debate over the annual oil well fee started two years ago when the city's 
Redevelopment Agency increased annual fees by 300%, to $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The fee increase is a result of what's taken place in the last couple of years 
in realizing that there has been a lot of contamination of the soil . . . which 
has really come about because of the oil field," Richard Weaver, former 
planning and development director, told the Redevelopment Agency at the time. 
"A source of funds is needed to deal with these problems." 
</P>
<P>
City officials estimated that it would cost at least $50,000 to clean up each 
well. On large parcels with many abandoned wells, the costs could total 
millions of dollars. Recently, Santa Fe Springs spent $4.1 million to clean up 
61 acres on an abandoned oil field before the Heritage Corporate Center, an 
office and recreation complex, was built in the center of the city. 
</P>
<P>
In August, the city proposed tripling the annual fee to $3,000 per well, which 
would have made well fees in Santa Fe Springs among the highest in Los Angeles 
and Orange counties. Again, city officials said more money was needed to clean 
up the oil companies' legacy of contamination and change the image of the city 
from an aging oil town to a community with attractive shopping centers and 
office buildings. 
</P>
<P>
But city planners, fearful that the 200% increase was not legally defensible, 
dropped the idea and proposed the $1,885 fire fee instead. 
</P>
<P>
Robert C. Wilson, the city's fire chief, said 22% of the Fire Department's 
$6.5-million budget is spent for special equipment, training and other services 
needed to battle a fire or hazardous chemical leak at the oil fields and 
refineries. 
</P>
<P>
The money the city normally allocates to the Fire Department for protecting the 
oil industry could be placed in a fund for cleaning up the old sumps, a 
roundabout way to solve the environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
The fire fee was passed by the City Council in November and was expected to 
generate about $917,000 annually. The city's two refineries, Powerine and 
Golden West Refining Co., were each ordered to pay an annual fire fee of 
$81,500. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson said all but two small oil companies have paid the fire fees that were 
due Dec. 7. Mobil paid $400,000 and agreed to pay the remaining $173,000 later. 
All the fees have been deposited in a special bank account until the suit is 
settled, according to Leigh DeSantis, assistant director of planning and 
development. 
</P>
<P>
John Mueller, an attorney for Mobil, said the oil company paid the fee so it 
could show the court that it complied with the city rule, even though it does 
not agree with it.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: PICO RIVERA; 
</P>
<P>
CRACKDOWN WILL BEGIN ON INOPERATIVE PARKED VEHICLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beginning Tuesday, code enforcement personnel will begin looking for 
inoperative vehicles parked on streets or stored on residential front lawns in 
Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
When such a vehicle is located, the registered owner as well as the property 
owner will be notified by a certified letter from the city explaining that city 
code requires the vehicles to be removed or stored in a garage. If the vehicles 
are not removed within 14 days, the city has the authority to tow away the 
vehicles to be sold for scrap. 
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the program is to build on the efforts of the Pico Rivera 
Redevelopment Agency and the City Council to improve the quality of life in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
The program will be a coordinated effort between the departments of Planning 
and Public Works. Questions should be directed to the Planning Department at 
942-2000.

GANGS BLAMED FOR 6 MURDERS IN 5 MONTHS IN HUNTINGTON PARK; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: CITY DEPLOYS 2 OFFICERS TO DEAL WITH 10 HARD-CORE GANGS AND AN ALARMING 
INCREASE IN THEIR VIOLENT CRIMES.

HUNTINGTON PARK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An alarmingly high number of violent crimes by rival gangs, including murders 
and drive-by shootings, have occurred in the city the past few months, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had more (gang crimes) in the past several months than we've had in the 
last several years," said Detective Mike Ewing, who is on the Police 
Department's anti-gang detail. "They're out of control." 
</P>
<P>
In the past five months, from August to Dec. 22, there were six gang-related 
murders compared to a single gang murder in all of 1988, according to Police 
Department statistics. 
</P>
<P>
There also have been 31 attempted murders, 31 drive-by shootings, 100 assaults 
with a deadly weapon and 89 gang-related robberies since August. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor William P. Cunningham said, "It's something we're going to have to look 
at next year. If we can find the money for more police, we'll definitely hire 
them." 
</P>
<P>
The city's two-officer gang unit was formed last January. Ewing and his 
partner, Detective George Hernandez, say there are eight to 10 hard-core gangs 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the recent violence involves members from Florencia, one of Huntington 
Park's oldest gangs, and the Bratz, a newer gang in the city. Ewing said he did 
not know the incident that started the fighting, but "they're killing each 
other because of something one gang did to the other." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the gangs based in Huntington Park, another 30 gangs have passed 
through the city at one time or another and committed crimes, the detectives 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the city's gang incidents this year: 
</P>
<P>
* A teen-ager was shot in the groin Dec. 21 by someone in a car who yelled out 
a gang name. 
</P>
<P>
* Seven juveniles were arrested Dec. 12 after they surrounded a 33-year-old man 
at a local park. One of the gang members slashed the man with a knife. 
</P>
<P>
* A 15-year-old boy who was standing with friends was shot and killed Dec. 10 
after an assailant claimed that the "B" on his hat stood for Bratz. The city is 
offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to a conviction in the case. 
</P>
<P>
* A 16-year-old boy was shot and killed in front of his home Oct. 7 after a 
carload of youths stopped to ask what gang he was from. 
</P>
<P>
* On Oct. 8, a man died after he was beaten with bats and rocks. He had entered 
a rival gang's neighborhood to drop off a friend. 
</P>
<P>
The recent increase in violence apparently has gang members on edge. The 
graffiti message "RIP" goes up in gang neighborhoods after fatal shootings. 
</P>
<P>
"They shot my dad's house," said one veteran Florencia gang member recently. 
"What's up?" 
</P>
<P>
Graffiti markings stake out territory around the city. A mural of the Virgin 
Mary with "Florencia" down one side, for example, adorns the wall of a building 
on the corner of Florence and Holmes avenues just west of Huntington Park. 
Ewing and Hernandez said some of the gang territories extend outside the city. 
</P>
<P>
The gangs do not battle over drug profits, as do their better armed 
counterparts in other areas of the county, Ewing said. Gang members in 
Huntington Park mostly use pistols; automatic weapons are virtually unheard of 
in the city's gang warfare. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the violence in Huntington Park is centered on several areas, including 
Arbutus Street, where Bratz gang members hang out just east of City Hall. 
Another hot spot in recent months has been the bar and discotheque in the 
Huntington Park Casino on the city's west side. 
</P>
<P>
"About five months ago we noticed more and more Florencia veteranos (older gang 
members) were visiting this place," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
The tension peaked Oct. 22, when a bar and parking lot fight broke out between 
suspected gang members amid a crowd of more than 200 at the casino, Police 
Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. About 30 law enforcement officers from 
Huntington Park, Bell, Maywood and the Sheriff's Department made 11 arrests for 
offenses that included assault to battery on a police officer, Connolly said. 
No one was seriously injured in the melee, he said. Since then, security has 
been increased at the casino. 
</P>
<P>
The more violent gang members are in their late teens, but younger gang members 
also can be dangerous, the gang-unit officers said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not uncommon for us to (come across) a 12- or 14-year-old and find a gun 
on him," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests and convictions for gang-related crimes are difficult to obtain. 
Witnesses, who fear retaliation, are afraid to report the crimes, the 
detectives said. 
</P>
<P>
"The people in this community understand the Bratz are killers," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
And surviving gang members would rather avenge the attack themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"That's why we're seeing an increase," Ewing said. "They're taking it into 
their own hands." 
</P>
<P>
Police Chief Connolly said his department has stepped up its anti-gang efforts 
by forming the two-man detail and by starting a boxing program to keep 
potential gang members off the streets. But Connolly said he also hopes to meet 
with police chiefs in neighboring cities to form a unified anti-gang unit. 
</P>
<P>
On the streets, Ewing and Hernandez said they need help in their fight against 
the gangs. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want it to get worse and it's getting worse," Ewing said. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND Gang violence has increased in Huntington Park despite recent Police 
Department efforts. In 1988, the department began a boxing program aimed at 
keeping youths off the streets and out of gangs. More than 40 kids are now 
enrolled, Police Chief Patrick M. Connolly said. In addition, Connolly formed a 
two-officer, anti-gang detail last January. The chief had pinned his hopes on a 
proposed utility tax to provide money to hire 15 additional officers to fight 
gangs and crime in Huntington Park. But voters overwhelmingly rejected the 
proposal in a special election last September.

ROOKIE PRO PLANS TO TEND TO BUSINESS ON PGA TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL McLEOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Greg Bruckner wheeled the new off-green Honda Accord onto Highland Avenue in 
Manhattan Beach. Pink Floyd's song "Money" played over the radio -- ironically, 
because Bruckner, a rookie on the Professional Golf Assn. tour, had just spent 
the better part of four hours talking about finances when he was supposed to 
discuss golf. 
</P>
<P>
In professional golf, conceded the fair-haired, slightly balding Bruckner, it 
is difficult to talk about the game without money entering the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"The PGA is a business," he said. "It's kind of spooky. I haven't really 
grasped all of it yet." 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner, 30, would have preferred to talk about the conditions on the public 
golf courses in Long Beach, about surfing El Porto or the neighborhood 
gatherings at Ercole's Bar in Manhattan Beach every Christmas Eve for the past 
25 years. But dollars and sense always crept back into the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
"Living in Manhattan Beach, people might think I grew up wealthy, but I did 
not," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He is a working-class golfer, one of the few to grace the PGA tour. And because 
he was raised in Southern California, with its reputation for casual 
appearances, he said he was singled out at PGA qualifying school by tour 
administrators. They told him the Levi's-and-T-shirt image he was accustomed to 
while playing in the Asian tour is unacceptable. There will be fines for 
inappropriate attire at airports, in hotel lobbies and on golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a pretty conservative guy," Bruckner said. "But I come from an atmosphere 
where you wear jeans, T-shirts and tennis shoes to go out to dinner." 
</P>
<P>
He must also score well in his first year or run the risk of having to qualify 
for his tour card all over again. He qualified this year, after four tries, at 
a PGA school in Houston, finishing in a tie for 10th out of 125 competitors. 
Only 50 made the cut to the big time. 
</P>
<P>
"They tell me only four rookies finished in the top 125 last year on the tour," 
he said. "That's my goal." 
</P>
<P>
Such raw enthusiasm seems out of place with the stodgy, good-ol'-boy image of 
the look-alike golfers seen on nationally televised PGA events. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a gentleman's sport," Bruckner said. "You don't find too many guys on the 
pro tour who learned the game on the public courses like I did." 
</P>
<P>
He taught himself, beginning at age 17 at Alondra Park near Lawndale and 
Torrance. He and his 6th Street buddies would hang out at the beach all day, 
then "play for beers" on the golf course in the late afternoon. For a while, 
Bruckner thought that was all there was to life. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a typical kid in Southern California," he said. 
</P>
<P>
A graduate of Mira Costa High School in Manhattan Beach, he eventually made the 
El Camino College golf team and went on to play another two years at Arizona 
State University while completing a degree in broadcasting. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner hit the amateur tournament circuits and then, with a $5,000 loan from 
his parents, accepted an offer to play on the Asian professional tour, where he 
has four victories in four years to his credit. 
</P>
<P>
More important, he scored well consistently half a world away, and his game has 
shown steady improvement. He boosted his earnings each year and paid off the 
loan to his folks. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes me feel good that I don't owe anyone anything, except to my parents 
for supporting me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
His attitude may help him as a pro in this country. 
</P>
<P>
"He has great desire and determination," said Chuck Courtney, a teaching pro at 
Rancho Santa Fe Golf Club near San Diego, who has worked with Bruckner. "He 
will do well (on the PGA tour). He's a streak putter. If he can get his putter 
going, he'll be OK." 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner is a long, straight hitter, according to Courtney, and "a great kid." 
If there is such a thing, he said, Bruckner is a self-made professional. 
</P>
<P>
"He started playing the game later than most of the people in the caliber of 
play he is in now," Courtney said. "Most kids at 17 who are where he is now 
were superstars by that age." 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner has set high goals for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"I think I can make $200,000 next year," he said while eating a hamburger and 
french fries at one of his favorite Manhattan Avenue hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
He doubts that he will have problems handling the pressure -- and the polyester 
-- of the PGA tour, which is steeped in genteel traditions rooted in the 
American South. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not out to buck the system," he said. "I just wear casual stuff. . . . I 
want to be me as much as I can." 
</P>
<P>
Because of his successes on the Asian tour, Bruckner has socked enough money 
away to sponsor himself next year. He typically spends about $25,000 to $30,000 
a year on expenses, staying in "medium-level places like La Quintas" when he is 
not in Asia. His gross earnings this year were just shy of $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
"I know guys who stay in nice places, and then I've seen guys living out of 
cars and showering at their friend's house," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner is somewhat frugal, he points out. Although he paid cash for it, the 
Accord was a splurge. The 1980 four-door Buick Regal he had been driving -- 
inherited after his grandfather's death -- was on its last legs. 
</P>
<P>
And then there are endorsements. His balls, clubs and shoes are gifts from 
sponsors. A clothing deal with a Southern California beachwear company that 
wants to bring out a golf line ("something cotton") is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
Telephone calls from potential sponsors have not stopped since he qualified for 
the tour. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm nervous, but this could be a very good thing for me," Bruckner said. 
</P>
<P>
Money aside, golf remains a game of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you shoot 68 four times a week all year, then you are going to win," he 
said. "You shoot a 73 and you won't win a dime." 
</P>
<P>
A good mental attitude helps, too, Bruckner said. "In golf, you know what 
you've got to do, but sometimes preparing to do it is tough." 
</P>
<P>
The Asian tour, ranked No. 4 in importance behind the PGA, Australian and 
European tours, has treated Bruckner well, allowing him to play under pressure 
on some of the world's most difficult courses and learn to adjust to a variety 
of cultures and climates. He has played in foursomes with Asian royalty like 
the king of Malaysia and been swarmed after by beggars in the streets of 
Calcutta. 
</P>
<P>
Trips to Pakistan and Australia stand out in his mind, as do numerous trips to 
his favorite country, Thailand. "It's so different from here," Bruckner said. 
</P>
<P>
But he is a Manhattan Beach homeboy at heart: "There isn't a better place in 
the world to live." 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner's favorite practice range is at the El Segundo Golf Course -- a place, 
he admits, most of his touring buddies would not lift a putter to. But it suits 
him well. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't come from a country club atmosphere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner left downtown Manhattan Beach and wound the Accord back to the El 
Segundo golf course, where earlier that morning he had paid $5 an hour for a 
practice fairway and green. Before lunch he had stood in the shadows of 
high-rise buildings and chipped range balls he removed from his own canvas 
sack. He wore the public-course player's cold-weather uniform: jeans and sweat 
shirt, worn saddle shoes with spikes and a portable stereo with earphones. 
</P>
<P>
An earth mover grunted not far away. Power lines hummed beside the practice 
range. The look on Bruckner's face said he was glad to be home. 
</P>
<P>
"Friends ask me, 'Why in the world would you practice here?' " he said. "El 
Segundo. It's a dump. But it's my dump."

ARMED BANDITS TAKE $1 MILLION IN GOLD HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two armed men posing as customers entered a shop in Los Angeles' bustling 
jewelry district Wednesday and escaped with nearly $1 million in gold dust, 
bars and jewelry chain. They left two shop owners and five employees gagged and 
handcuffed, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The raid, regarded as one of the largest and most daring ever in the nation's 
second-largest jewelry district, was engineered by two men in sport coats who 
apparently used briefcases to hide handguns and to make off with more than 100 
pounds of loot, authorities said. Most of the payload was in 24-carat gold used 
to manufacture jewelry chain. 
</P>
<P>
No one was injured in the robbery at the Rope Mine Jewelry Corp., a sixth-floor 
wholesaler and manufacturer at 610 S. Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
However, the gunmen, who entered the store shortly after 8 a.m., repeatedly 
threatened to shoot their hostages before abandoning them -- gagged and bound 
at the wrists and ankles -- in a closed office, shaken employees said later. 
</P>
<P>
"I said (to myself), 'I'm already in my coffin,' " shop owner Khatchik 
Djigardjian recalled. " 'They're going to kill me. They took everything and 
they're going to kill me.' It was the worst time of my life. I've never been 
that close to death." 
</P>
<P>
Employees managed to summon help only after one of them pulled a telephone from 
a desktop and dialed the 911 emergency number by working her hands behind her 
back. They were able to sound the company's burglar alarm only after the 
suspects had fled. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers "calmly walked past the security guards in the lobby," Los Angeles 
police said. "We rarely get this type of robbery downtown," said Lt. Robert 
Kurth. "To my knowledge, this is the first time we've had a robbery of this 
magnitude during the Christmas season." 
</P>
<P>
The theft was believed to be the largest in the jewelry district since a 1983 
robbery and shoot-out in which $1.3 million in valuables was stolen. A suspect 
was later arrested. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, $2 million to $4 million in gems and gold jewelry was taken in a 
holdup similar to Wednesday's, in which two gunmen bound, gagged and 
blindfolded wholesalers on the 13th floor of the Pacific Jewelry Center on Hill 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, two gunmen posing as rabbis pulled off a smaller but similar 
robbery, escaping with about $300,000 worth of valuables, Kurth said. No one 
was arrested in that case. 
</P>
<P>
Kurth said investigators may have a "50-50" chance of apprehending Wednesday's 
two robbers, based on fingerprints, descriptions and a videotape taken from 
security cameras in the building's lobby. 
</P>
<P>
Shop owner Djigardjian, 42, described one robber as a thin man over 6 feet tall 
with blond hair. The other was short, bald and appeared to be Asian or 
Middle-Eastern, he said. Both men were wearing sunglasses, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators late Wednesday were comparing those descriptions -- and 
conflicting descriptions given by other store workers -- with security 
videotapes. Those tapes, intended to show everyone who enters or leaves the 
building, contain "several good frames" of two men who might be the suspects, 
Kurth said. 
</P>
<P>
But detectives were waiting for more employees to see the tapes before reaching 
that conclusion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We do not have a positive ID on the videotape at this time," Kurth said. "We 
have (images of) two possible suspects we are going to work on with photo 
enhancements and composite drawings." 
</P>
<P>
However, he added, "We can't even get the hair color off the video. We're 
running into difficulties with the suspect descriptions. We're going to handle 
that all real carefully." 
</P>
<P>
Djigardjian, who described himself as the West Coast's largest manufacturer of 
gold jewelry chain, operates his company much like scores of others in the 
jewelry district, where high-rise buildings are crowded with a polyglot of 
manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers who do business worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
The proprietor said he buys 24-carat gold, which he melts into 14-carat bars 
and ships to a factory in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, where the chain is made. It is 
then shipped back to Los Angeles, where his employees polish it and prepare it 
for sale to retailers. 
</P>
<P>
When the two men showed up at the locked door of his company office on 
Wednesday, Djigardjian used a video monitor to observe them standing in the 
hallway, he said. Seeing their coats and briefcases, he assumed them to be 
potential customers and pressed a button to electronically unlock the door and 
let them in. 
</P>
<P>
The shorter man introduced the visitors as New Yorkers and asked about the 
merchandise. Djigardjian said he led the two men toward his own office to talk. 
But as he did so, the taller man approached from behind and put a gun to his 
neck. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt on my neck a cold thing," the Russian Armenian immigrant recalled. 
"When I turned to my right, I see the gun. . . . As he took my hand, he said, 
'Don't move . . . or we're going to blow your head off.' " 
</P>
<P>
Although he was only a few feet from the burglar-alarm button on his wall and 
from a loaded .357-magnum revolver in his desk, Djigardjian said he was unable 
to reach either as the robbers handcuffed him and placed him face down on the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
Still at gunpoint, he was ordered to call his brother and the five employees 
out from the back work room, one at a time, and each, in turn, was also bound 
and placed on the floor. At that point, both robbers were brandishing guns, 
Djigardjian said. 
</P>
<P>
The six-foot-high office safe had been opened by the store owner before the 
bandits entered. After handcuffing all the employees, Djigardjian said, the 
robbers cleaned out the safe, leaving two $100 bills and other paper currency 
that had been taped to the inside of the door as business mementos. 
</P>
<P>
The robbers left after about 15 minutes, Djigardjian said. 
</P>
<P>
One employee, Lady Martin, was able to get her hands on the phone cord and to 
yank it off the desk. She dialed 911 and another employee, Maria Franco, freed 
herself enough to talk to the police dispatcher. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Djigardjian lay on the floor and kicked one wood door until it 
splintered and opened, enabling him to get to a burglar alarm. Police officers 
were almost there by the time he sounded it. 
</P>
<P>
Djigardjian said there was no chance during the robbery to "make like . . . a 
cowboy movie" and confront the robbers. He said he does not know how much of 
the gold is insured, explaining that much of it belonged to his customers. 
</P>
<P>
"I chose my life," he said. "I can make that money with hard work. . . . I can 
start over. I'm just glad to be alive."

<P>
BUCHAREST, Romania 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For all but the last two weeks of this year, Communist Eastern Europe passed 
through one of the most remarkable political transformations in modern history, 
a massive upheaval that was accomplished with hardly a shot fired. 
</P>
<P>
The peaceful nature of the process was all the more remarkable for the fact 
that Communists in Poland, Hungary, East Germany, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia 
had either been installed or held onto power through four decades by either 
outright violence or systematic coercion. 
</P>
<P>
The Czechoslovaks, who waited until almost the last, could not resist bathing 
themselves in Vaclav Havel's praise for their "gentle revolution" -- an idea 
that probably gave the cautious Czechoslovaks more credit than they deserved 
but nevertheless managed to stand as a characterization for the whole year. 
</P>
<P>
And then Romania happened. 
</P>
<P>
There was no gentleness here. The ferocity of the fight that drove Nicolae 
Ceausescu into flight Friday and continued until his execution Monday was on a 
scale familiar to Beirut, not Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
The assistant health minister said Tuesday that confirmed casualties, for the 
whole country, stood at 746 dead and about 1,800 wounded. Most of the deaths 
are believed to have occurred in Bucharest, not the western city of Timisoara, 
where the revolution against Ceausescu's rule began. The early estimates of 
casualties in the tens of thousands were exaggerated, but were apparently an 
outgrowth of the vicious battle put up by Ceausescu's secret police unit, the 
Securitate. 
</P>
<P>
Why was the Romanian revolution so bloody while the rest of Eastern Europe 
displaced the Communist monopoly on power so peacefully? 
</P>
<P>
The two main reasons, as evident now as the rubble and blown-out buildings 
around Bucharest's Palace Square, are the Securitate and the iron grip with 
which Ceausescu held the country. 
</P>
<P>
Ordinary people in Romania, not a veteran band of dissidents, started the 
demonstrations against the regime in a way similar to the street protests weeks 
earlier in East Germany and Czechoslovakia. The difference here was in the 
government response. The Ceausescu government believed, from the beginning, 
that raw force was the only reliable means of forestalling a collapse of the 
regime. 
</P>
<P>
Compromise Doomed 
</P>
<P>
In a way, Ceausescu was right. From the earliest changes in the East Bloc this 
year, which occurred in Poland, it was evident that once the Communists began 
to compromise with the opposition, they were finished. It was a principle 
enunciated by the 19th-Century political theorist Alexis de Tocqueville that no 
time is so dangerous for a repressive government than the moment when it begins 
to liberalize. 
</P>
<P>
Ceausescu may not have been a devoted reader of De Tocqueville, but he took it 
as a matter of faith that no compromise was possible. In the last decade of his 
rule, when his regime became harshest, no quarter was ever given to the few 
dissidents in the country. Most of the best-known dissidents, such as Doina 
Cornea, a Cluj University professor, were watched incessantly or kept under 
house arrest. Lesser-known "subversives" were dealt with even more harshly. 
</P>
<P>
When the demonstrations began in Timisoara on Dec. 16, the Securitate began to 
move into place. On Dec. 17, they began to act. Demonstrators -- the exact 
number remains unclear -- were shot down in the town square. That day and the 
next, 47 soldiers of the regular Romanian army were publicly executed by the 
Securitate for refusing to fire on the unarmed protesters. 
</P>
<P>
Fired on Crowds 
</P>
<P>
That action was an indication of what was about to come. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning last Thursday, as the protest spread for the first time to Bucharest, 
the ruthlessness of the Securitate became even more evident, and Romania's 
struggle began to look more like a coup attempt in a Third World country. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, what happened in Romania seemed even more irrational. 
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday night, the Securitate fired on crowds of thousands in the Palace 
Square. It has never been clear how many died, but doctors estimated the number 
to be at least several hundred. 
</P>
<P>
During the early morning hours, trucks were sent to the square to pick up the 
bodies, and the blood was washed off the cobblestones with fire hoses. 
</P>
<P>
Romanians knew, by now, the price they would have to pay for Ceausescu's 
overthrow. And they were willing to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at one hospital told of one young man who came in with one eye forced 
out of its socket by the full blast of a high-pressure fire hose. The doctors 
were forced to remove the eye. The young man then went back into the streets 
and was on the square when the firing started. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, flew by helicopter from the 
roof of the Central Committee building on the Palace Square. By that stage, the 
army had gone over to the side of the people, its commanders refusing to issue 
orders to shoot into the crowd. But the Securitate was just getting warmed up. 
</P>
<P>
By Friday night, a raging toe-to-toe battle began in the heart of the city 
between the Securitate and the army. In a scene that seemed absurdist in its 
juxtaposition of frightful violence and carnival celebration, thousands of 
Romanians watched, cheering, from the square and the surrounding streets as the 
army and the Securitate traded hundreds of thousands of rounds of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Arms in Tunnels 
</P>
<P>
The Securitate used a network of tunnels that linked their headquarters, which 
faced the Central Committee building across the square, with at least a dozen 
large buildings in the vicinity. The new government says the tunnels were 
outfitted with weapons, ammunition and communications gear. 
</P>
<P>
No one is sure how many Securitate forces were involved in the battle, which 
raged in similar fashion in five other major cities, but the total strength of 
the Securitate is estimated at about 700,000. Not all of them, of course, were 
trained as a military defense force. Some were simply eavesdroppers and 
informers. 
</P>
<P>
Through Friday night, scores of Romanians were hit by Securitate fire. Many 
were killed by shots to the head, indicating that the Securitate men were 
skilled marksmen using rifles equipped with infrared telescopic sights. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses looking on from the 19th floor of the Inter-Continental Hotel, about 
three blocks away, could see Securitate men jump up, spray machine-gun bullets 
onto the square below, then duck out of sight as the army poured heavy fire 
into the window. Presumably, the Securitate gunmen would then move to another 
location, possibly even a different building. 
</P>
<P>
Remarkably, the Securitate did not give up, even though it seemed clear they 
were fighting for a lost cause. The provisional government announced that the 
Ceausescus had been captured and were in custody but -- perhaps not believing 
the reports -- the Securitate continued to fight the hit-and-run war, 
apparently aiming to inflict as much damage as possible. It was as though 
Nicolae Ceausescu had left behind him a sort of living booby trap. 
</P>
<P>
A few Securitate men turned up at the city's hospitals with wounds, and doctors 
said most of them had come with pistols hidden in their bandages and appeared 
to be drugged. Most had to be heavily sedated before they could be treated. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, it may be some time before the mystery of the Securitate is fully 
revealed. The government has given a deadline of 5 p.m. local time today for 
those still at large to surrender. Those who do not, the government said, will 
face summary trials and executions -- the same fate as Nicolae and Elena 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
It seems likely, however, that many of them have escaped through their network 
of tunnels and by now are moving unnoticed through the crowds in the streets. 
Some may be discovered in the days to come, and some undoubtedly will manage to 
escape across the borders to neighboring countries. It is possible that they 
managed to destroy records and Securitate rosters that might have been used to 
identify them. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to bring them to justice could occupy Romanians for months. But what 
happened here in the last two weeks will be remembered by the Romanian people 
for decades.

<P>
The provisional government of Romania on Wednesday warned secret- police 
snipers still holding out in Romanian cities to surrender by nightfall today or 
face death by firing squad if they are captured. 
</P>
<P>
But after five days of skirmishes between the army and bands of secret police 
left over from the regime of executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, Bucharest and 
other major cities were mostly quiet. There has been only sporadic shooting 
after the Christmas Day execution of Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. 
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, the new government revoked many of the most repressive laws 
and decrees of Ceausescu's regime, including a massive rural resettlement 
program widely criticized by international human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
The new government moved to dismantle the chief weapons that Ceausescu used to 
support his regime -- the Interior Ministry and its state security police. 
Provisional President Ion Iliescu transferred the State Security Department, 
including the remnants of the dreaded Securitate secret police units, from the 
Interior Ministry to the Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
From the early stages of the Romanian uprising against Ceausescu in Bucharest 
last week, the Defense Ministry, represented by the armed forces, has been 
loyal to the National Salvation Front government. State newspapers, recently 
reborn under new logos to disaffiliate them from the Ceausescu regime, brimmed 
with praise for the soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
"The Army by the People's Side, the People by the Army's Side," headlined the 
Communist Party paper, renamed from The Spark to The Truth. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry, under Ceausescu the most powerful institution in 
Romania, was left with only the police inspector's office, fire brigades and 
prisons under its control. 
</P>
<P>
Securitate agents still at large face trial when they surrender but have been 
promised leniency if they comply with the government's deadline. If they do not 
surrender, however, the government has warned that "extraordinary tribunals" 
would employ "emergency measures" and immediate judgment against those who 
continue to resist -- a clear indication that firing squads will be employed. 
</P>
<P>
(Early today, Western diplomats said that some of the secret policemen began 
heeding the ultimatum and were giving up their weapons to the authorities, 
Reuters news agency reported.) 
</P>
<P>
With organized fighting in the country mostly over, the new regime has moved 
quickly to consolidate public support, acting first to repeal some of 
Ceausescu's most hated policies. 
</P>
<P>
They ranged from a law requiring Romanian citizens in schools, colleges and 
public meetings to address each other as tovaras, the borrowed Russian word 
meaning "comrade," to a statute on urban and rural planning that led to 
systematic destruction of entire towns and the forced settlement of hundreds of 
thousands of Romanians. 
</P>
<P>
Program Condemned 
</P>
<P>
Romanian minority communities, mainly Hungarians living in Transylvania and 
Germans living in the north, had accused Ceausescu of using the resettlement 
program to break up ethnic communities. The program had been condemned by 
international human rights organizations. 
</P>
<P>
These same minority organizations were quick to assert themselves under the new 
government. 
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Hungarian activists formed the Hungarian Democratic Union of 
Romania, which set goals of creating a government ministry for minorities; 
expanding the number of schools teaching in regional ethnic tongues, and 
officially recognizing the right to use these languages in public. While not 
officially illegal under Ceausescu, using Hungarian or German often resulted in 
the arrest of the speakers as foreign agents. 
</P>
<P>
Other laws and decrees revoked by the new government included: 
</P>
<P>
* Laws banning private ownership of copiers and computer printers and requiring 
all owners of typewriters to provide the security police with a two-page typing 
sample each year that would allow identification of individual type faces. 
</P>
<P>
* The ban on abortion and related laws forbidding the sale of all 
contraceptives, part of Ceausescu's plan to increase the number of his subjects 
from the current 23 million to 30 million by the end of the century. 
</P>
<P>
*The 1976 law that declared Bucharest and 21 other major Romanian cities and 
towns "closed cities" into which people could not move without official 
permission. 
</P>
<P>
* The bizarre 1984 resolution of the National Assembly regulating "scientific 
nourishment" of the population. Under this law, used by Ceausescu as an excuse 
for food shortages in the population, calorie limits were assigned to citizens 
based on their jobs. A miner, for example, was allotted 6,000 calories a day, a 
journalist or a clerk only 2,000. In defense of this law, widely ridiculed 
outside Romania, Ceausescu several times criticized his own people for 
overeating and hoarding food. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, one of the key ways the new government appears to be attempting to win 
the support of the people here is by making more food instantly available on 
the Romanian market. 
</P>
<P>
Program Condemned 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly this week, items not seen in years here in the empty shops, such as 
coffee and oranges, have made their way to the shelves. 
</P>
<P>
"We had fresh coffee in our office for the first time in four years," an 
official with the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities took several other measures to ease the grimness of life here, 
playing Christmas carols in the city's subway system and, for the first time, 
picking up rock music videos from European stations. 
</P>
<P>
First among the new videos was Tina Turner, singing "We Don't Need Another 
Hero." At the University subway stop, an English version of "O Little Town of 
Bethlehem" blared from speakers as citizen anti-terrorist patrols frisked 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
Outside food stores, residents of the capital spilled into the streets, 
standing in long lines to buy fruit, meat and other foodstuffs. Under 
Ceausescu, imports of such products were strictly limited under a severe 
austerity program aimed at building hard-currency reserves and, many Romanians 
believe, at grinding down the population so that people would not have the 
energy or spirit to revolt. 
</P>
<P>
Between 1981 and this year, Ceausescu managed to pay off Romania's entire 
$10-billion foreign debt through his austerity program, exporting the richest 
food products from the fertile Danube valley. 
</P>
<P>
The program caused such bitterness here that one of the most popular wall 
posters during the uprising said "Ceausescu Is a Pig, Packed for Export." 
</P>
<P>
Apartment dwellers also reported that heat in the huge, prefabricated complexes 
built in the Ceausescu period had been raised from 59 degrees to 68 degrees 
Fahrenheit. A limit on household heating was another fuel-saving program 
instituted under the dictator that caused great hardship to elderly residents. 
</P>
<P>
Course Unclear 
</P>
<P>
But while the new leaders appeared set to dismantle Ceausescuism, it is far 
less clear how far they will go toward ending communism. 
</P>
<P>
In sharp contrast to the new leadership elsewhere in Eastern Europe, the new 
government has said little about the introduction of a market economy, an end 
to state planning or recognition of private property rights. 
</P>
<P>
In a televised speech discussing the new government's plans, for example, 
Iliescu said only that he hoped to free the economy from "excessive 
centralism." 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, in the political sphere, the government has promised free elections 
will be held in April, but little has yet been said about laws that would 
create the environment needed for truly democratic elections -- assurances of a 
right to free association and free press, for example, or guaranteed access by 
opposition groups to state television.

PAPAL ENVOY OKS U.S. ARMY RESCUE IF HOSTAGES TAKEN; 
</P>
<P>
PANAMA: AN AMERICAN COMMANDER AND THE VATICAN'S NUNCIO REPORTEDLY DISCUSSED 
MEMO GRANTING LIMITED AUTHORITY TO ENTER THE EMBASSY.

The Vatican's representative in Panama City has granted authority to the U.S. 
Army to free any embassy employees who might be taken hostage by former 
Panamanian dictator Manuel A. Noriega or others who have taken refuge in the 
Vatican's embassy there, according to a document obtained by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
One U.S. official interpreted the authorization as an invitation to the U.S. 
military to seize Noriega, who took refuge in the embassy on Christmas Eve. 
Another official, however, said: "It doesn't mean we can just walk in any time 
we want." 
</P>
<P>
The document declares: 
</P>
<P>
"In the case that the suscriber (apparently a reference to the memo's author) 
or any member of the personnel of this Embassy be taken as hostage by any 
person or group of persons, I hereby authorize the United States of America 
Army to take all the steps that it may deem necessary to set the hostages free. 
</P>
<P>
"Any harm to the hostages must be avoided." 
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was addressed "to whom it may concern" and was signed by 
Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, the papal nuncio in Panama City. It is dated 
Dec. 26, two days after Noriega, accompanied by several loyalists, took refuge 
in the embassy after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. forces. 
</P>
<P>
The authenticity of the letter and its contents were confirmed by three senior 
Bush Administration officials. A State Department spokesman refused to confirm 
or deny the existence of such an authorization. An Administration official, 
however, said that the State Department learned of the memorandum for the first 
time Wednesday night and added that officials there reacted with shock at the 
document's contents. 
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said that, when Noriega took refuge in the mission, 
the United States warned that it could not be responsible for the safety of the 
mission's employees. That might have led Laboa to provide the advance 
authorization for U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. government official declared that the memorandum could also be 
used as rationale for the Army to seize Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't go in unless they invite you in," he said, "and this sounds like an 
invitation." 
</P>
<P>
Several U.S. officials said that Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the U.S. 
Southern Command, which has overseen the American military operation in Panama, 
apparently discussed the writing of such a memo with Laboa before the envoy 
wrote it. The memo was dated Tuesday, the day the ambassador talked at length 
with Thurman in front of the embassy. 
</P>
<P>
Several of the Noriega loyalists at the papal embassy brought their families 
with them, according to U.S. officials. In addition, four Basque terrorists, 
deported from Spain to Panama in 1987 and fearing for their freedom, took 
refuge in the mission on the day of the U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources said that officials of the mission took the firearms of the 
Noriega loyalists when they were admitted. But a senior U.S. government 
official added: "You can't be sure they've given them all up." 
</P>
<P>
According to one Administration official, Laboa raised with U.S. officials as 
early as Christmas Day the possibility that a hostage situation was in progress 
or could develop. Laboa reportedly said that he would want the United States to 
attempt a rescue if such a hostage-taking were confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
American military officials were concerned that Laboa's oral expression of his 
wishes would not constitute sufficient authority for action by U.S. forces and 
asked him to put his wishes in writing. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't look good going up against the Catholic Church," said a government 
official in Washington. "It looks great, though, to come to its rescue." 
</P>
<P>
As the diplomatic mission of the Vatican, the "apostolic nunciature" is 
considered under international law to be the territory of a sovereign entity. 
Without a formal "invitation" to U.S. forces to intervene, any action by U.S. 
forces would be a clear contravention of international law, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not carte blanche," said one Administration official. "The language is 
pretty specific. It doesn't mean we can just walk in any time we want." 
</P>
<P>
A second Administration official took pains to distinguish between Laboa's 
written "authority" and the necessary presidential authority that U.S. forces 
would need to make a rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"That's not authority," the official said. "It's a lot less than meets the 
eye." 
</P>
<P>
The official said there are no grounds for concluding that a hostage-taking 
incident already has occurred and added that neither a hostage seizure nor a 
U.S. rescue is a "likely outcome." 
</P>
<P>
"But he (Noriega) might do something stupid," the official said. "And we're 
prepared for everything." 
</P>
<P>
While officials denied that U.S. military authorities dictated the contents of 
Laboa's memorandum, they said U.S. officials were eager to have Laboa's wishes 
recorded. 
</P>
<P>
"If I were he, and I were the slightest bit worried I might be taken hostage 
and that at that time it would be too late, I would set it to writing, too," 
one official said. 
</P>
<P>
Another senior government official, however, said Thurman is likely to have 
encouraged Laboa to offer the United States a formal invitation to intervene. 
Such an action could produce one of the goals of the U.S. invasion -- the 
capture of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"I know Thurman is impatient and would like to do something about the situation 
at the embassy," the official said. "He is a devout Catholic, and he finds the 
situation very troubling." 
</P>
<P>
American tanks and troops had the Vatican's embassy in Panama City surrounded 
Wednesday as the U.S. operation entered its eighth day. Government officials in 
Washington acknowledged that the encirclement might raise pressure on Noriega 
and his loyalists and provoke the hostage-taking that could lead to a U.S. 
rescue attempt. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of confining," said one official. "He's not allowed to communicate, 
although he can see that whatever he had is slowly but surely crumbling. He 
could become fairly desperate." 
</P>
<P>
One Administration official said the U.S. forces surrounding the embassy would 
be careful not to provoke a hostage-taking. At the same time, officials said 
that it still is not clear how the U.S. forces surrounding the nunciature would 
know whether hostages had been taken. 
</P>
<P>
"They may have worked out some signals," said one official, who added jokingly, 
"Maybe if you see all the shades go down, you'll know." 
</P>
<P>
There is only one recent precedent for a country to storm the diplomatic 
mission of another nation in an attempt to free hostages. In May, 1980, British 
commandos mounted a rescue attempt on Iran's embassy in London, where Iranians 
held 20 hostages. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, Abolhassan Bani-Sadr, then president of Iran, requested Britain's 
help in freeing the hostages. In a letter of thanks following the commando 
raid, Bani-Sadr observed that "each and every government (must) look after the 
safety of diplomats on their territory."

The Vatican said it will not turn deposed dictator Manuel A. Noriega, who has 
taken refuge in its embassy in Panama City, over to the United States. However, 
the Vatican's representative in Panama City has granted authority to the U.S. 
Army to free any embassy employee taken hostage by Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
President Bush, still hoping to change Pope John Paul II's mind, may send a 
special envoy to Rome to argue the case.

U.S. authorities turned over $5 million to Panama from one of several bundles

million. Washington filed similar requests with Switzerland, Luxembourg and 
Britain.

JEWELRY DISTRICT'S SECURITY SYSTEMS ARE NOT FAIL-SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KRISTINA LINDGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the multimillion-dollar jewelry district of downtown Los Angeles, security 
precautions can range from armed guards and video cameras to alarms, sensitive 
electronic entry and exit ways and even bullet-proof glass partitions or 
security waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But a jeweler or manufacturer who pays top dollar for such protections may 
never be completely safe, especially if a determined thief is willing to take 
time to gain their confidence, according to security officials and others who 
work in the jewelry district, which is concentrated on Hill Street and 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
"You can have cameras, (electronic alarm) buttons, armed guards -- even fire 
escapes that are wired," said Marcell Mobley, security supervisor for the Von 
Lewis Security Co., which protects the Los Angeles Jewelry Center in the 600 
block of Hill Street. 
</P>
<P>
If a jeweler decides to allow entry to strangers when he has substantial 
amounts of gold or gems on hand -- as the owner of the Rope Mine Jewelry Co. at 
610 S. Broadway did Wednesday morning -- "then we have no control over it," 
Mobley said. "That's one of the hazards of . . . being open to the public. It's 
kind of hard to prevent this sort of thing." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of Wednesday's brazen theft of nearly $1 million in 24-karat gold 
grains and other gold products, the two robbers bound the owner and his 
employees before they could push alarm buttons, and escaped before they could 
alert authorities. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a sad thing to have happen," said Moussa Hassid, business manager for the 
Jewelry Center. "For a business owner, it is very difficult to know whether it 
is a legitimate business person or not." 
</P>
<P>
Some security company officials expressed confidence in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
"The kind of thing that happened (at the Rope Mine Jewelry Co.) is not going to 
happen here," said Clark Wilmoth, who handles security at the California 
Jewelry Mart, which is home to numerous jewelers and jewelry manufacturers on 
Hill Street. "We can't take any more drastic measures -- not unless we want to 
spend a billion dollars and have an aircraft carrier sitting in the street." 
</P>
<P>
Still, even the best measures are not foolproof, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Someone can come in and look at a certain diamond, will pass themselves off as 
someone that knows the language of diamonds. They may come back two or three 
times before they steal anything so they can gain the store owner's 
confidence," Wilmoth said. 
</P>
<P>
Detective Lou Boozell, who specializes in jewelry thefts for the Los Angeles 
Police Department's Robbery-Homicide Division, compared security systems to 
insurance policies: "You can have too little or too much." 
</P>
<P>
Some places within the jewelry district have very little in the way of 
security, Boozell said. Others have "alarms, locked doors, double-locked 
entrances" and security waiting rooms. 
</P>
<P>
But even so, he added, many business owners don't check for identification. 
"You've got to reach a happy medium between how much security is enough and how 
much is so much that (it) would scare away the people." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson Colton, president of A-Mark Precious Metals Inc. in Los Angeles, one of 
the nation's leading wholesalers of precious metals, expressed surprise that 
strangers were allowed entry where so much gold was on hand. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd actually have a bullet-proof window between me and a customer if I had 
that much (gold). . . . I would not let people in an office of that nature 
unless I previously had identified them." 
</P>
<P>
Colton, whose firm usually employs armored security guards to transport 
precious metals and does not keep valuable material on the premises, added that 
Wednesday's gold theft was somewhat unusual in his experience. 
</P>
<P>
"Very rarely are you actually hit for gold," he said. "Diamonds are robbed and 
things of this kind. This obviously was well planned." 
</P>
<P>
If nothing else, the gold theft serves as a reminder for others to be on their 
guard, security experts said. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole jewelry district is alerted about this now," Mobley said. "Once word 
spreads . . . it will be more difficult to gain entry. . . . People will be 
more cautious. They'll say, 'If you're a regular customer, I'll let you in. If 
I don't know you, I won't.' "

TURTLES RESCUED FROM COLD OCEAN

Seventy-six cold-stunned sea turtles floating helplessly were plucked Wednesday 
from the chilly waters off the Canaveral National Seashore, bringing to 232 the 
number of turtles picked up this week. Sixty-one of the turtles have died. 
</P>
<P>
Twenty turtles were en route to Sea World of Florida in Orlando, where 75 were 
already recovering in tanks of warm water, park curator Frank Murru said. The 
others were to be trucked to Disney World in Orlando. 
</P>
<P>
"Almost all of them are doing very well," Murru said. "They just need to be 
warmed up. Quite a few of them are eating already, so that's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
Murru said that, after they have recovered, the turtles will be tagged and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
"(The turtles) do float with their backs up, and they try to get a little air 
every now and again, but some of them get so weak they drown," Canaveral refuge 
spokesman Bruce Blihovde said. "It's all cold related." 
</P>
<P>
He said the water temperature dropped to about 46 degrees during the recent 
cold snap. 
</P>
<P>
"When the water gets around 50 degrees . . . it starts getting stressful for 
turtles," he said.

Waterways frozen by record low temperatures in the South and Northeast slowed 
shipping Wednesday, while plumbers worked overtime to repair thousands of water 
pipes that burst when they froze. 
</P>
<P>
Ice on the Mississippi River forced the Coast Guard to ban nighttime barge 
traffic from Cairo, Ill., to the Arkansas-Louisiana border, delaying shipments 
of heating oil, coal and grain. 
</P>
<P>
The restrictions will be imposed indefinitely along the 450-mile stretch of the 
river, where 10 barges have run aground since Christmas Day, Lt. Cmdr. Rick 
Kowalewski said. Chunks of ice floating downstream have knocked over buoys 
marking the navigation channel, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the reasons why we are allowing only daylight operation," 
Kowalewski said. "They (the buoys) are hard to use during the day, and 
impossible at night." 
</P>
<P>
In the East, this is turning out to be the iciest winter on Chesapeake Bay 
since 1976-77, with foot-thick ice in places. In 1976, much of the estuary 
froze. 
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard has been hampered in its efforts to clear shipping lanes 
because the four ships it used for ice-breaking are in for repairs, said Lt. 
Cmdr. Steven Waldmann. 
</P>
<P>
Farther north in Pennsylvania, up to a half-foot of ice on Pittsburgh's three 
rivers has brought barge and boat traffic to a virtual standstill. Ice covers 
at least 70% of the Allegheny, Monongahela and Ohio rivers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, homeowners and plumbers in Houston were working as fast as they 
could to repair thousands of pipes broken during three days of record-setting 
lows. 
</P>
<P>
Houston officials said that, by midday Wednesday, water pressure in the city 
was up to 80% as leaks were gradually plugged. 
</P>
<P>
In Jackson, Miss., Mayor Kane Ditto said crews working to restore service to 
the remainder of 60,000 homes and businesses that had been without water were 
still finding new problems. He said there were 33 breaks in Jackson's 900 miles 
of water lines Wednesday morning, up from 10 the night before. 
</P>
<P>
The 50,000 residents of New Orleans' public housing projects have had little or 
no water. City officials said water pressure dropped from a normal 65 pounds 
per square inch to about 47 because of pipe breaks. 
</P>
<P>
The Louisiana freeze, called the harshest of this century by meteorologists, 
sent temperatures below 32 degrees for almost 82 hours in New Orleans and below 
15 degrees for 15 hours. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to ravaging citrus trees, the freeze hit the Louisiana fishing 
industry hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Not only are there thousands of frozen fish in the marshes, but we also have 
oysters frozen in their shells. The seafood has been totally spoiled, ruined," 
said Joe Buras, president of the Delta Commercial Fishermen's Assn. of 
Plaquemines Parish.

HOMELESS VETERANS IN 10TH DAY OF HUNGER STRIKE

Two homeless veterans living in the nation's first shelter exclusively for 
military veterans Wednesday entered the 10th day of a hunger strike to protest 
what they call "dictatorial" management at the Queens facility. 
</P>
<P>
Earl Bettoe and Benjamin Colon, whose protest is supported by many of the 400 
veterans at the Borden Avenue Veterans Residence, told reporters that they 
started their fast after shelter managers warned them that they would lose 
their beds if they left for Christmas visits with their families. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of us are combat vets, and we are treated like children," said Colon, 36, 
leaning unsteadily on the cane he said he has carried since he was injured in 
Vietnam. "We want jobs, we want apartments, we want a place we can be with our 
children. This place doesn't help you get none of those." 
</P>
<P>
The veterans phoned the New York Civil Liberties Union, which has taken up 
their cause and arranged for negotiations with the Salvation Army employees who 
run the shelter under contract with New York City. 
</P>
<P>
Residents at the 2-year-old shelter, which has drawn inquiries from officials 
contemplating similar projects nationally, are demanding more medical care and 
assistance in finding jobs and permanent housing, and an easing of restrictions 
such as the 10 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred J. Peck, a Vietnam veteran hired by the Salvation Army to run the 
$4.2-million facility, said 80% of the shelter's clients are found to be drug 
or alcohol abusers and that 20% suffer some form of mental illness. The 
shelter's strict rules, he said, are "a motivator" to help the men learn 
responsibility.

<P>
The first newspaper to appear on Panama's streets since the U.S. invasion 
called on citizens Wednesday to rally behind the new U.S.-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
The violence put newspapers out of action for nearly a week. La Estrella de 
Panama is the only one to resume publishing so far. 
</P>
<P>
Previously, the paper generally supported the ousted government of Gen. Manuel 
A. Noriega, though it did report on activities by the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said Panama is in the most desperate economic, moral and social 
situation in its history. 
</P>
<P>
Looting and violence that swept the country after the invasion have exhausted 
Panama's resources and commercial and industrial activity, it said in an 
editorial. 
</P>
<P>
"In these conditions, all Panamanians have to make common cause with the new 
governors in their leading role of democratizing the nation, uniting the 
family, formalizing respect for human rights and fostering real liberty of 
expression," it said. 
</P>
<P>
The newspaper's managing director, Tomas Duque, was proposed as administrator 
of the Panama Canal by the Noriega-backed government but was rejected by the 
United States, who felt he was close to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Its deputy director is Dr. Carlos Ozores Typaldos, the country's provisional 
vice president until last week's invasion.

Afghan rebels marked the 10th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan 
on Wednesday by rocketing Kabul and vowing to continue the struggle to 
overthrow the government that Moscow put in place. 
</P>
<P>
Kabul Radio said an unspecified number of rockets struck the Afghan capital, 
wounding 18 people and causing considerable damage. Eight people were killed 
Tuesday when 30 rockets hit the city in one of the largest recent barrages. 
</P>
<P>
The moujahedeen rebels held rallies in refugee camps in Pakistan's North-West 
Frontier province, home to more than 3 million people who fled across the 
border after Soviet troops poured into Kabul in late 1979 to install Babrak 
Kamal in power. 
</P>
<P>
"We will continue our struggle until the puppet regime collapses," Sibghatullah 
Mojaddidi, president of the Afghan interim government, told a rally at the 
Nasirbagh camp near Peshawar, home of the government-in-exile. 
</P>
<P>
In New Delhi, about 250 Afghan refugees shouting "Death to Russia!" held a 
protest Wednesday to mark the anniversary of the Soviet invasion. 
</P>
<P>
Observances were also held Wednesday in Moscow. At the Tomb of the Unknown 
Soldier, located against the Kremlin Wall, a military brass band played the 
national anthem as an honor guard marched in formation, the Soviet news agency 
Tass said.

Metropolitan Pitirim of the Russian Orthodox Church led a memorial service at

U.N. AGENCY ASKS FOR 700,000 TONS OF FOOD TO AVERT ETHIOPIA FAMINE

A U.N. agency appealed Wednesday for 700,000 tons of food to avert widespread 
starvation in northern Ethiopia, where as many as 4 million people are 
threatened by famine. 
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization said its estimate was based on a 
recent crop survey, which found that serious drought had cut harvests by nearly 
80% in Eritrea province and 50% in Eritrea's southern neighbor, Tigre. 
</P>
<P>
Rebels in northern Ethiopia said Wednesday they have defeated a major offensive 
by government forces and captured the large town of Debre Tabor in Gonder 
province, 200 miles north-northwest of Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Tigre People's Liberation Front said that 3,200 government 
troops were killed or wounded in heavy fighting starting last week. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very significant victory," spokesman Tewolde Gabru said from London in 
a telephone interview. He did not detail rebel losses. 
</P>
<P>
The FAO said there also would be food deficits in eastern Ethiopia and to a 
lesser extent in pockets of the southern and central regions. 
</P>
<P>
An "international relief operation of major proportions" is needed to avert a 
repeat of the 1984-85 drought and famine when an estimated 1 million people 
died, said FAO Director General Edouard Saouma, in a statement issued in 
Nairobi. 
</P>
<P>
Saouma also urged donors to provide logistic support to ensure the "timely 
delivery" of aid. 
</P>
<P>
Fighting in Eritrea and Tigre between the government and insurgents has closed 
many roads, a situation that might require aircraft for relief deliveries.

Vandals tore through a Jewish secondary school in Silver Spring, Md., upending 
furniture and equipment and smashing bottles of laboratory chemicals. Police in 
the Washington suburb said the 12-room school, Yeshiva of Greater Washington, 
apparently was invaded late Tuesday, the fifth night of the Jewish festival of 
Hanukkah. The school, which has 85 students in grades seven through 12, was 
closed this week. The vandalism was classified as a "hate-violence incident" 
because of messages left behind, officials said. The word "Satan" was written 
in chalk on a blackboard and the words "Roman Catholics rule" were scribbled 
across six lockers.

A record number of grizzly and black bear sightings have been reported at the 
Glacier National Park in West Glacier, Mont., but biologists said they are 
unsure if the bear population has changed. The park said there were 2,935 
sightings of bears this year, up from 2,162 last year and breaking the record 
2,895 sightings in 1987. This year's total included 1,290 black bears and 1,318 
endangered grizzlies. "It's my feeling we can't make any firm conclusions from 
those figures," Park Service biologist Steve Gniadek said. "It could be that 
more were reported than in the past, or we could have more bears, or it could 
be that the bears are more visible."

Negotiators for striking coal miners and the Pittston Co. resumed talks in 
Washington and were expected to bargain around the clock to settle the 
9-month-long walkout by New Year's Day. The sides returned after a Christmas 
break from negotiations that officials said had come close to agreement. "A 
great deal of progress was made," said Herb Fishgold, spokesman for federal 
mediator W. J. Usery. The violence-marred strike by about 1,700 coal miners in 
Virginia, West Virginia and Kentucky against Pittston's coal subsidiary began 
April 5.

A strike-bound coal company sought $60 million in a lawsuit accusing the United 
Mine Workers of organized criminal activities. The suit, brought by the New 
Beckley Mining Corp. of Beckley, W. Va., under the federal Racketeer-Influenced 
Corrupt Organizations statute, claims the union and its members have engaged in 
nationwide racketeering involving attempted murder, arson and extortion. The 
company announced also that it will close its mine at Glen Daniel, W. Va., 
where 130 men have been out on strike since January. It blamed what it called 
union violence for the closing.

CLOSURE OF MONTEREY COUNTY'S FT. ORD CONSIDERED

<TEXT>
<P>
Budget cuts and logistical demands are leading top Army planners to consider 
closing sprawling Ft. Ord in Monterey County and moving its primary tenant, the 
7th Infantry Division (Light), to Ft. Lewis, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
The cost of operating the beachfront facility, its potential real-estate value 
and its distance from Travis Air Force Base -- a problem emphasized during the 
invasion of Panama -- led to the reassessment of the fort's future, according 
to two independent military newsletters. 
</P>
<P>
The impact of closing the 28,000-acre facility could be significant in Monterey 
County. Nearly 16,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians employed at the fort 
generated about $970 million this year in payroll, contracts and federal aid to 
local schools, the Army said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, closure of the 28,057-acre facility could open much acreage 
for development in one of the most affluent resort areas on the coast.

A federal judge has upheld the validity of San Francisco's contract preference 
system for minorities and women over a claim of reverse discrimination by white 
contractors. The challenged city ordinance provides preferences in bidding to 
minority and women construction contractors in the city. U.S. District Judge 
Thelton Henderson refused to issue a temporary restraining order to block 
enforcement of the law. The 1989 ordinance is "an attempt to end the old boy 
network" that allowed white contractors to dominate the construction business 
with the city, according to Deputy City Atty. Mara Rosales. Associated General 
Contractors of California Inc., a nonprofit California corporation 
headquartered in Sacramento, challenged the ordinance. The group, representing 
700 general contractors, contended the city violated the equal protection 
clause of the Constitution by adopting a policy of discriminatory awarding of 
contracts in favor of certain racial and ethnic minorities. The suit also 
maintained the system violated the city Charter.

TRAUMA TROUBLES: Orange County once had five trauma centers; with the closing 
of Fountain Valley Regional Hospital's center, it now has three (B1). . . . 
Since 1980, the centers have reduced the mortality rate in "preventable deaths" 
from 70% to under 5%, according to research by Dr. John G. West, a St. Joseph 
Hospital surgeon and trauma expert. . . . If another center closes, a potential 
disaster looms because of the domino effect on other aspects of medical care, 
West says, adding: "No way two trauma centers can do it." Dana Parsons and Mark

ELECTION: LATINOS REVEAL DOCUMENTS THEY SAY PROVE THAT REPUBLICANS INTENDED TO 
INTIMIDATE THEIR ETHNIC GROUP. GOP SAYS INSURANCE CONCERNS FORCED DEAL.

Five Latino voters announced Wednesday they have accepted $400,000 to settle 
their lawsuit against Republican officials who posted uniformed guards at 
polling places last year, and they revealed documents that they said prove that 
the Republicans had intended to intimidate Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
The evidence released at a morning press conference included a deposition from 
Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange), who told attorneys he once joked with 
county Republican chairman Thomas A. Fuentes and the county GOP's executive 
director Greg Haskin about the possibility of driving green vans around polling 
places to give the impression that Immigration and Naturalization Service 
agents were lurking in the area. That idea was not pursued. 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for the five voters said they believe that the evidence would have 
clinched a victory in the case, in which Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden 
Grove) and the county Republican Party were accused of conspiring to violate 
voting rights in Pringle's race for the 72nd Assembly District seat. 
</P>
<P>
But the plaintiffs said at the press conference that they decided to settle 
because the money was adequate and the suit had succeeded in highlighting the 
issue and forcing changes, such as a new state law barring use of uniformed 
guards at polling places. 
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs also decided to contribute $150,000 of the settlement to 
nonprofit, nonpartisan groups working for voter education and registration in 
Latino areas of Pringle's district. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Joseph Remcho, representing the plaintiffs, said Pringle and the 
Republican officials "may have succeeded in buying this election with security 
guards," but the settlement satisfies the five voters because it marks the 
highest sum ever paid in a voting-rights case. 
</P>
<P>
"This clearly will send a message nationally that you just can't do this," 
Remcho said. "Goons in polling places will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Republican officials involved in the case failed to return calls 
Wednesday seeking comment on the settlement and the documents that were 
released. Others declined to discuss the settlement or could not be reached. 
Their lawyers said last week that they admitted no wrongdoing by settling the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
The GOP's Haskin declined to comment on Wednesday's developments and instead 
referred a reporter to a prepared statement issued by the Republican Party's 
defense attorneys last week. In the statement, the defendants said the five 
voters had "struck out" in their bids to overturn the election results and to 
prove any wrongdoing by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
Attorney Darryl R. Wold, who represented the county Republican Party, said the 
plaintiffs were on "a flight of fancy" in thinking they could have won the 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's announcement marks the end of the federal lawsuit, which was 
scheduled for trial Jan. 16 in Santa Ana. The defendants disclosed the 
settlement on Friday, but it was not final until the plaintiffs signed it 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Flanked by four of the five plaintiffs, Remcho presented documents that he said 
made his case a "sure-fire winner." 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the Lewis deposition, the evidence included notes scribbled by 
political strategist Michael R. Williams after a meeting with another Pringle 
consultant, Carlos Rodriguez. Williams wrote in a corner of his calendar on 
Oct. 17, 1988, the words Carlos and goons and, in another corner, the names of 
security guard companies. 
</P>
<P>
Also noted in the margin are the numbers of Republicans and Democrats 
registered in the area and Lewis' name, which Remcho said indicates that the 
Orange assemblyman had been involved in the decision. 
</P>
<P>
An Oct. 19, 1988, memo from Williams to Rodriguez outlines the security guard 
program, noting that the 20 guards would be in uniform and that "voters will be 
challenged." 
</P>
<P>
Wold, the county GOP's attorney, said that the 20 guards did nothing wrong, 
that in final instructions the guards had been told not to challenge or stop 
voters and that Williams' "goons" notation referred to Democrats who were 
allegedly registering voters illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Other evidence presented included a map of the 72nd Assembly District, on which 
an employee of Rodriguez indicated to a sign-making company where they should 
post signs for the Pringle campaign, Remcho said. 
</P>
<P>
The map showed plans to put signs reading "Thank You Curt Pringle" in 
predominantly Caucasian areas and signs -- in Spanish and English -- that said 
"Non Citizens Can't Vote" in largely Latino areas. 
</P>
<P>
One of the plaintiffs at the press conference, Jose Diaz Vargas, 53, a Santa 
Ana police officer, said he was on his way to vote on Nov. 8, 1988, when he 
heard that uniformed guards were patrolling the polling areas. He went home but 
later changed his mind in anger and went back to vote. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very upset," he said. "This kind of conduct, I did not expect this to 
happen in the United States. Maybe in some other countries, but not in the 
United States. . . . I went back to the voting place, but how many other people 
didn't go back?" 
</P>
<P>
The five plaintiffs will keep $17,000 each, Remcho said. They are Vargas; Rudy 
Rios, 39, a business agent for a local labor union; Helen Canales, 60, and her 
husband, Tommy Canales, 68, who are both retired, and Jane Fantauzzi, 74, a 
retiree who has since moved to Fontana. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier settlements of $20,000 from the county registrar of voters and $60,000 
from the firm that employed the security guards bring the total settlement to 
$480,000. 
</P>
<P>
A sixth plaintiff, Rumaldo Madrid, got $2,000 from earlier settlement proceeds 
before he was dropped from the suit last month. Madrid, the only voter who 
contended that the guards actually dissuaded him from voting, was dismissed 
because he was not sure whether the guards who harassed him were the same ones 
hired by the Republicans. Republican officials cited that to bolster their 
contention that the guards did not keep anyone from voting. 
</P>
<P>
The largest chunk of settlement money, $243,000, will go toward attorney's fees 
and costs, which exceeded $400,000, Remcho said. Some of the legal debt will be 
eased with $100,000 raised by Democrats, Remcho said, including $50,000 in 
campaign money from Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, $35,000 from other 
Democratic legislators and $15,000 from private citizens. 
</P>
<P>
The settlement encompasses all the remaining defendants: Pringle; the county 
Republican Central Committee and two of its officials, executive director 
Haskin and chairman Fuentes; Lewis; Pringle's campaign manager, Marsha 
Gilchrist; political consultants Williams and Rodriguez, and attorney William 
P. Godfrey. 
</P>
<P>
Remcho said the plaintiffs had no interest in using the lawsuit as a political 
weapon to damage Pringle's image in 1990, when he can run for reelection. They 
said it is more important to funnel $150,000 into Latino voter registration and 
education projects. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't a partisan thing," Rios said. "These were my civil rights." 
</P>
<P>
Defense attorneys said the defendants did not want to settle, but their 
insurance companies insisted "for purely economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
If the defendants had chosen to go to trial anyway, they would have given up 
their right to insurance coverage for their legal fees, the attorneys said. The 
insurance firms will pay the $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
County Republican Party officials contend that they did nothing wrong by 
posting the guards at polling places in predominantly Latino areas of Santa 
Ana. They said the guards were there only to monitor possible election fraud, 
in response to a rumor that Pringle's Democratic opponent, Christian (Rick) 
Thierbach, planned to bring in illegal voters to tip the contest in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
But Democrats and Latinos said that the guards, who carried signs in English 
and Spanish warning that non-citizens cannot vote, were trying to scare Latinos 
away from voting booths. 
</P>
<P>
Local and federal agencies are still investigating to see whether criminal 
charges should be filed over the posting of the guards. 
</P>
<P>
Thierbach, who lost the 72nd Assembly District seat to Pringle by 867 votes, 
said it is a shame that "the insurmountable evidence of illegal activity" by 
the Republicans will not be revealed in a trial.

Polling place guards -- Articles on Dec. 28 and 29 erred in describing 
statements by Assemblyman John R. Lewis (R-Orange) in connection with a lawsuit 
over uniformed guards at Santa Ana polling places in 1988. In a deposition, 
Lewis said he had "a vague recollection" that during a pre-election meeting he 
attended, "someone" joked about creating the impression that immigration agents 
were ative on Election Day. He said he did not recall any "serious discussion" 
about it. Lewis said in the deposition he did not remember who made the joke.

FIRED SANTA ANA OFFICIAL WINS $1.8-MILLION SUIT 
</P>

<P>
A judge, overturning a jury verdict, has awarded $1.8 million to a former 
top-level official with the city of Santa Ana who claimed that he was fired 
because of his age and his efforts to expose wrongdoing in city hiring, the 
fired official said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Donald Bott, 55, of San Clemente, now interim personnel chief for the city of 
El Segundo, had asserted that Santa Ana city officials laid him off four years 
ago because he refused to "play ball" in tolerating alleged mismanagement and 
favoritism in city practices. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, an Orange County Superior Court jury refused to award Bott 
damages as a result of his dismissal during a budget crunch after 17 years as 
director of personnel. But then, Judge Leonard Goldstein, in an unusual move, 
agreed to reconsider that decision, signaling that he found merit in Bott's 
claim. 
</P>
<P>
Bott said his lawyer received notice this week that Goldstein, setting aside 
the jury's verdict, has held the city liable for $1.83 million. That is just 
shy of the amount Bott said he lost in earnings because of his abrupt dismissal 
in 1985, forcing him into unemployment and a bankruptcy filing. 
</P>
<P>
Court records show Goldstein signed an order in the case last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers handling the case for Bott and the city of Santa Ana, as well as 
Goldstein and his court clerk, were on vacation Wednesday and could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana City Atty. Edward J. Cooper, who did not try the case, said he has 
received no word yet of a decision. Cooper said he was surprised by the 
reported amount of the verdict but that he had expected some damages against 
the city in light of earlier rulings by Goldstein. 
</P>
<P>
"I've felt all along that Judge Goldstein was in error in his rulings. I don't 
think the facts of the case warrant any verdict (for Bott)," Cooper said. He 
added that a verdict against the city would "unquestionably" be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
The city asserted that it was forced to lay off Bott because of tight budget 
conditions in 1985 and that it was well within its rights to do so. 
</P>
<P>
"He served at the will of the city," Cooper said, "and he had no vested right 
to remain as director of personnel." 
</P>
<P>
Cooper said Bott's entire claim was built on an invalid agreement that Bott had 
made privately with the former city manager in the 1960s, assuring Bott a lower 
civil service position if he were ever let go as personnel head. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an unlawful, secret agreement that emasculated the civil service 
system," Cooper maintained. 
</P>
<P>
But Bott saw his dismissal differently. 
</P>
<P>
A gray-haired man with a methodical manner, Bott asserted that he was the 
victim of a youth movement ushered in by then-City Manager A.J. Wilson. 
According to Bott, Wilson wanted to bring a fresher, sharper image to city 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Bott also claimed that his position was abolished and that he was let go 
because he had fought "unconscionable managerial practices" during Wilson's 
regime as city manager. He alleged that Wilson and other city officials used 
their powers to bypass civil service requirements, putting under-qualified 
people in place of employees who were out of favor. 
</P>
<P>
For example, Bott alleged in his lawsuit that Wilson demoted a long-tenured 
secretary and replaced her in a newly created position with a "young, 
attractive typist clerk who, in fact, did not meet the minimum qualifications 
established by the city." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson was named a co-defendant but was not held liable for damages, according 
to Bott. Wilson said Wednesday that he had not heard about a decision and 
declined to discuss the case in detail, saying only: "He was laid off because 
of a budget cutback. That's it." 
</P>
<P>
But Bott maintained in an interview Wednesday that "I was fired because I . . . 
wasn't playing ball with the management." 
</P>
<P>
"I always knew I had a just case. I felt that the jury came to the wrong 
conclusion and that justice was denied me," Bott said. "This substantiates what 
I've been saying all along, and it was worth all the legal frustration." 
</P>
<P>
One juror who heard the case in June, Lillian Fukuharu, said Wednesday: "He 
didn't prove his case to our satisfaction. . . . I really felt bad for (the 
Bott family), but the factors -- age discrimination and all that -- just wasn't 
there for us."

CRIME: RELATIVES, NEIGHBORS STRUGGLE TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW AND WHY JAMES WARD 
WAS RUN DOWN AND KILLED BY A MERCEDES-BENZ ALLEGEDLY DRIVEN BY HIS WIFE'S 
STEPMOTHER.

<P>
The six-foot sheet of paper adorned with roses and the message "Jimmer We Love 
You" is stretched across a lawn on Congress Street as a memorial to James R. 
Ward, who died after being hit last week by a Mercedes-Benz allegedly driven by 
his wife's stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
The message -- written by Ward's wife, Wendy, and placed less than 10 feet from 
the bloodstained asphalt where her husband was struck -- stands as a sad 
reminder of a confusing and tragic death. 
</P>
<P>
As funeral arrangements were being made Wednesday for Ward, a 31-year-old 
maintenance mechanic, police, family and neighbors were grappling to make sense 
of it all. 
</P>
<P>
"I miss my husband very much. . . . Nothing is going to bring him back," Wendy 
Ward said Wednesday in a brief telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
Police say they are still investigating to determine the motive in what police 
allege was an intentional attack. 
</P>
<P>
Betty Y. Davies, 58, the suspect in the case, has declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
According to police records, the Wards had complained to police that Davies had 
harassed them on at least four occasions in the past three years -- incidents 
that included allegedly vandalizing their cars and making annoying phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody really knows why she did the things she did. . . . Even Wendy is not 
sure," said a family friend of the Wards who spoke on the condition that she 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
Davies' attorney, Marshall M. Schulman, declined to comment on the case or on 
any previous complaints that could have involved his client and the Wards. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Davies was not arrested on any of the harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa Sgt. Ron Smith, who is supervising the current investigation, said 
he does not know what the outcome of the previous complaints. But friends of 
the Wards say the complaints were dropped for lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
"Harassment calls come in all night and all day long," Smith said. These kinds 
of cases "are a dime a dozen and take up a tremendous amount of our time." 
</P>
<P>
Davies, who lives in Newport Beach with Wendy's father, John R. Davies Jr., was 
arrested Dec. 19 on suspicion of attempted murder after a confrontation in 
which Ward was struck by her car near his home. 
</P>
<P>
Ward died Saturday at Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach. Police say they will 
request that she be charged with murder. Davies was released Dec. 19 after 
posting $75,000 bail. She is scheduled to be arraigned Jan. 22. 
</P>
<P>
Neighbors and friends said that on the night of the incident, someone parked 
about six houses down the street from the Wards' residence, which is in the 800 
block of Congress Street, and walked up to the house. 
</P>
<P>
A neighbor phoned the Wards to say that a person was lurking around their front 
yard, the friends said. James Ward apparently "escorted" Davies back to her 
car, said one neighbor. Wendy Ward was the only person to witness what happened 
to her husband, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Helen Granneman, who lives near the spot where Ward was struck, said Wednesday 
that she did not see anything but that she heard Wendy's cries as she ran 
toward her husband after he fell. Granneman said the paper memorial had 
originally been placed in the street but that she moved it to her lawn because 
passing cars were driving over it. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the yellow roses placed on top of the paper, Granneman said: "I 
thought I ought to move it. . . . This has been a very sad thing for the 
neighborhood."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON;

<P>
CITY TO JOIN TALKS ON MONORAIL PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Fullerton has joined the list of cities interested in a proposed monorail 
system that would link major shopping, entertainment and business centers in 
the county. 
</P>
<P>
City officials will join others from Santa Ana, Orange, Irvine, Costa Mesa and 
Anaheim at a meeting next month to discuss the monorail, Mayor A.B. (Buck) 
Catlin said. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say (Fullerton) definitely should be one of the northern terminals" of 
the monorail line, Catlin said. "Fullerton is very much a hub city in North 
County." 
</P>
<P>
As now envisioned, the backbone of the system would be a single-line, raised 
monorail capable of carrying cars about 60 m.p.h. along a route from Irvine 
through Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Orange, ending in Anaheim. Lower-speed 
monorails would branch off the main line to ferry passengers to locations east 
and west. 
</P>
<P>
The network would link John Wayne Airport and the sprawling Irvine Spectrum 
office and industrial complex to sites including South Coast Plaza, Disneyland, 
Anaheim Stadium, MainPlace shopping mall and the Santa Ana Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton's participation would take the network farther north, possibly 
including links with Cal State Fullerton and the city's Amtrak depot. 
</P>
<P>
Catlin said Fullerton attracts 50,000 students at five colleges and 
universities annually, and the train depot is the busiest between San Diego and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
The system, which would be the first commercially operated public monorail in 
the country, could be built along existing streets, requiring the purchase of 
little or no private property, officials have said. Catlin said that 
Fullerton's leg of the system could be funded by public grants and money from 
private redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the other five cities agreed earlier this month to unite in pushing 
for the system. Officials of the cities promised to work toward issuing a joint 
request early next year for proposals from private firms that might be willing 
to build and operate the system. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Larry Agran of Irvine called Fullerton's tentative participation 
"terrific." 
</P>
<P>
"It's evidence of the readiness of cities to build a system that will relieve 
our dependence on the private automobile." Agran said. TED JOHNSON

<P>
Two days after he was severely injured when he crashed his bicycle into a 
limousine, a cyclist has been identified by relatives, La Habra police said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
Jesus Solorzano Mendoza of Buena Park, in his late 20s, was listed in critical 
condition at UCI Medical Center, where he has been semiconscious with head 
injuries since the accident on Christmas Day, police and hospital officials

POLICE GET RAISE BUT AREN'T SATISFIED

<P>
Officers and other employees of the Police Department received a 5.4% salary 
increase Wednesday under a new, one-year contract that was praised by city 
officials but approved reluctantly by police representatives. 
</P>
<P>
Police had sought an increase of 9%, according to Arl Farris, president of the 
police officers' association, while the city originally offered 2%. 
</P>
<P>
"Our pay is at the bottom end of the county, and we don't feel our performance 
is at the bottom end of the county," Farris said. 
</P>
<P>
City Manager Robert C. Dunek said that the City Council was pleased with the 
department's performance and that the salaries agreed upon are a reflection of 
what the city can afford. 
</P>
<P>
"The council is proud of what the police do in this city," Dunek said. 
</P>
<P>
The contract, formally approved Tuesday night, covers the period between Nov. 5 
and Oct. 30, 1990. The council had met in closed sessions during the last 
several meetings to hammer out the new contract. 
</P>
<P>
Police officer salaries will range from $31,968 to $39,264 a year under the new 
contract. The old range was $30,324 to $37,248 annually. 
</P>
<P>
The salary range for chief of police will be $56,916 to $72,900 under the new 
terms. The old range was $53,729 to $70,044. 
</P>
<P>
Farris noted Wednesday that association members approved the settlement by the 
narrowest of margins earlier this month. KATHIE BOZANICH

AMTRAK COMMUTERS BALK AT PARKING FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY PAULSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Train commuters unhappy about losing free parking spaces to a new, $2-per-day 
garage claimed Wednesday that downtown merchants are gaining customer parking 
at their expense. 
</P>
<P>
Merchants claimed just the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
"For years, the commuters have been taking our parking spaces and walking past 
our shops," said Mike Darnold, co-chair of the Downtown Merchants Assn. 
</P>
<P>
City resident Robert Ross, who acts as spokesman for a loosely knit group of 
daily commuters on the well-traveled Amtrak line between San Juan Capistrano 
and Los Angeles, said that a boycott of downtown shops is being considered. 
</P>
<P>
He said the boycott would be in retaliation for what commuters view as a move 
by city officials to force them to pay for parking. 
</P>
<P>
"The (merchants) around the train station have been making noise that they need 
the additional parking when they really don't," said Ross, a six-year commuter. 
"We figure that if we make an impact on their business, maybe they'll retract 
their request." 
</P>
<P>
Darnold scoffed at the idea that the train riders, with their 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
hours, could affect local trade, which he said is largely dependent on tourist 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
"I doubt very seriously that these people are our customers in the first 
place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Most merchants near the train station and Mission San Juan Capistrano for years 
have put extra parking high on their wish lists, Darnold said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to that demand, Community Redevelopment Agency officials made a deal 
with Franciscan Plaza developer Paul Farber to lease 131 spaces in his 
multilevel parking structure for commuters, beginning Jan. 2. The $2 fee -- the 
first of its kind for rail commuters in Orange County -- is being imposed to 
offset costs of maintenance and security. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the 99 free spaces at the lot at the Capistrano Depot will be 
limited to three-hour parking. 
</P>
<P>
For those unable or unwilling to pay the $2 fee, free parking will be provided 
on a dirt lot at the corner of Yorba Street and El Camino Real, about one block 
from the train station, said Jeff Parker, assistant to the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had a lot of calls and letters," Parker said, noting that most people 
complained about how the fee would be charged. A meter accepting eight quarters 
will be used. 
</P>
<P>
Notices about the change were circulated about two weeks ago and came as a 
surprise to most commuters, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer said the fee ensures that city taxpayers won't be 
footing the bill for commuters who live in other South Orange County cities and 
park their cars in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
Commuters interviewed Wednesday varied in their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very reasonable," said Ronald Barr, who for two years has ridden 
the train to Anaheim. "It would be nice if it was free, but I'd have to support 
the facility." 
</P>
<P>
Others said it wasn't fair to levy charges on a group of people who already are 
paying fares of up to $15 per round trip in an effort to reduce freeway traffic 
and corresponding smog. 
</P>
<P>
"It's one more nail in the Southern California coffin," Ross said. "This should 
be supported with tourist dollars and people who go to the movies, rather than 
those who are trying to get cars off the road." WENDY PAULSON

ARSON IS BLAMED FOR STORE FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A raging fire that destroyed a large Thrifty Drug Store and caused an estimated 
$2 million in damage was deliberately set inside the store, a Fire Department 
official said Wednesday. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fire, which required the efforts of nearly 50 firefighters and 12 pieces of 
equipment, damaged four adjoining small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
No suspect has been identified, and the motive for the arson is unknown, the 
fire official said. 
</P>
<P>
During the fire, aerosol cans exploded, leading to initial reports -- later 
found to be false -- that the explosions had set off the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"The fire didn't start by exploding hair spray cans. It was started by someone 
setting some paper goods on fire," said Bill Dumas, a fire captain and arson 
investigator for the department. 
</P>
<P>
The spectacular blaze, which broke out about 9:30 p.m. Tuesday and continued 
burning until about 1 a.m. Wednesday, destroyed the Thrifty Drug Store at a 
shopping center at Katella Avenue and Euclid Street. 
</P>
<P>
"The cause of the fire was arson," Dumas said at the fire scene Wednesday. "It 
started in the area of the (hair spray cans), and it was the heat from the fire 
that made them explode. The paper goods were down low, and the cans were up 
high above them. We don't have any suspects at the present time, but we're 
working on some leads," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas, in response to questions, said there is no indication that the arson is 
gang-related, although he noted that the area has a lot of gang activity. He 
also said that there were no juveniles in the drugstore at the time the blaze 
started and that investigators are not looking into any disgruntled or former 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
"We think we know what happened, but I can't go into it while the investigation 
is in progress," Dumas said. 
</P>
<P>
Dumas said a customer inside the drugstore first noticed the fire about 9:30 
p.m. "He saw the fire in an overhead mirror -- you know how these stores have 
mirrors that can view things back in the store," Dumas said. "The man told the 
sales clerk, and she placed the alarm." 
</P>
<P>
Dumas and others at the fire scene on Wednesday morning said about four 
employees and five customers were in the store when the fire broke out. 
</P>
<P>
"The employees attempted to contain and control the fire but were 
unsuccessful," said Dumas. "When the Fire Department arrived, there was smoke 
showing out of the front of the building, and guys pulled up right in front. As 
soon as they got off the engine, the whole front of the building blew out -- 
what we call a back-draft condition." 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, only the shell of the 10,000-square-foot stucco-and-tile 
building remained. The roof had caved in and burned. The interior of the store 
was heap of blackened rubble. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Guest, owner of the nearby The Guest Gallery store, said he arrived at 
the scene about 10 p.m. Tuesday, at the height of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a picture of hell, that's what it was," said Guest. "It was an 
inferno." 
</P>
<P>
Guest's store sustained extensive smoke and water damage. He was carrying out 
damaged paintings on Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the second time I've had a fire damage my store," he said. "There was 
a fire in my store about 15 years ago, and I had bad losses then, but this 
damage this time is worse." 
</P>
<P>
Dumas estimated total damage to the drugstore and adjacent stores at between 
$1.5 million and $2 million, of which $750,000 was in damaged merchandise and 
other contents. BILL BILLITER

ILLEGAL DUMPING POSES WATER THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Illegal garbage dumping in the Trabuco Creek area has created a threat to 
drinking water for thousands of South County residents, water experts said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
"We went out there and looked at it, and we felt that there might be potential 
for contamination," said Fred Sims, general manager of the Trabuco Canyon Water 
District, which serves about 7,500 people. 
</P>
<P>
The district is in one of the county's fastest-growing areas and is rapidly 
expanding its service. 
</P>
<P>
Officials of the state's Regional Water Quality Control Board visited the site 
of the garbage dumping last week and determined that the dump did not pose an 
immediate hazard, Sims said. Still, he and other district officials remain 
concerned about the potential hazard, because the site is upstream from two 
district wells. 
</P>
<P>
The site is on private property and several hundred yards off Trabuco Creek 
Road, a dirt and gravel road that runs east from Trabuco Canyon Road near 
Rancho Santa Margarita. Property owners in the area say they have been unable 
to control the dumping, and as a result the garbage has grown into a huge, 
scattered pile. 
</P>
<P>
Sims said the heaviest concentration of debris is 300 to 400 yards long and a 
"couple hundred yards wide." More garbage is scattered closer to the roadway, 
and the debris includes refrigerators, abandoned cars and household trash. 
</P>
<P>
The several owners of the site said county officials have indicated that the 
owners might be held responsible for cleaning up the trash. 
</P>
<P>
But what particularly worries district officials and residents is that the dump 
may contain paints, solvents or other toxic chemicals that could poison the 
water supply if sudden rains wash them into nearby Trabuco Creek. Because the 
site is on private land, it is rarely patrolled, so officials can only guess 
what may lie in the heap. 
</P>
<P>
Residents say there has been a noticeable increase in dumping during recent 
weeks, which they attribute to a combination of stricter controls at local 
landfills and rapid growth in the Rancho Santa Margarita development. Some of 
the debris, according to residents, is construction material. 
</P>
<P>
If people are illegally dumping trash that is refused by the local landfills 
because it is too hazardous, residents say, the water supply could be at risk. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there's an appreciable danger," said Sam Porter, a property owner in 
the area and a member of the water district board. "We're exposing an extremely 
valuable watershed to potentially dangerous chemicals." 
</P>
<P>
Porter has moved that the board close Trabuco Creek Road to traffic as a way of 
halting further dumping, and that suggestion will come before the board's 
engineering committee next week. Sims said he is not sure the board can legally 
close the road, but added that the matter will be reviewed by the district's 
legal staff. 
</P>
<P>
After being considered by the engineering committee, the motion would probably 
proceed to the full board for a vote on Jan. 17, Sims added. JIM NEWTON

TITUS IS A TOWER OF STRENGTH AS LOARA HOLDS OFF MARINA, 51-45

Center Tracy Titus didn't get much scoring help in the first half of Loara's 
opening-round game of the Marina girls' basketball tournament Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
The 6-foot-5 Titus scored all 11 of Loara's first-quarter points and 15 of her 
team's 18 first-half points as the Saxons trailed Marina at halftime by three 
points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, teammates Liz Redman, Kristin Thibodeau and Traci Berven 
combined for 10 points and Titus added eight of her own as Loara (4-6) 
outscored Marina, 18-9, on its way to a 51-45 victory. 
</P>
<P>
Marina (8-3), which has lost three in a row, doesn't have a player that stands 
more than 5-10 and, thus, had trouble against Titus inside. And the Vikings 
couldn't get their fast break or shooting game going, not even when Titus 
fouled out with more than four minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
"We just didn't shoot the ball well," Marina Coach Pete Bonny said. "We had 
about 13 to 14 shots in the key the first half. If we had hit half of those, we 
would have been up by 13." 
</P>
<P>
Marina's high-scoring guard, Melissa Sortino, had 19 points, including four 
three-pointers. The Vikings hit two three-pointers in the fourth quarter, the 
second cutting Loara's lead to 49-44, but that was as close it would get. 
</P>
<P>
Marina was forced to foul to stop the clock, and though Loara missed of 13 of 
22 free throws, the early impact of Titus proved too much to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
"They had one kid who could score," Bonny said. "They got it to her every time 
and we just couldn't stop her." 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Lakewood 68, Estancia 60 -- Melody Earle, a 5-9 junior, scored a game-high 27 
points for Estancia. Charon Johnson led Lakewood with 24. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 53, Huntington Beach 46 -- Carrie Burt scored 14 points and Dina 
McKinney added 12 to lead the Diablos (10-3), who were without leading scorer 
Jennifer Rohrig. Her flight was fogged in at Seattle. Jana Davis led the Oilers 
(4-6) with 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
Edison 54, Katella 43 -- Bronchitis kept Debbie Fischer on Edison's bench to 
start the game, but she came in early in the first quarter and hit back-to-back 
three pointers to spark the Chargers (6-2). Fischer finished with four 
three-pointers and 26 points. Ruth Harker and Karen Jensen each scored 16 for 
Katella (3-6). 
</P>
<P>
Ocean View 68, L.B. Wilson 28 -- Ocean View played its second string for most

EVEN WITHOUT TWO STARTERS, TUSTIN PROVES IT CAN HANDLE A TOUGH TEST

<P>
The undefeated and, perhaps, underrated Tustin High School basketball team 
entered the Coast Christmas tournament with some questions to be answered. Such 
as, are the Tillers as good as their record indicated? 
</P>
<P>
The answer appeared to be yes, at least Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin defeated Huntington Beach, 51-48, in a first-round game at Estancia High 
School. But it wasn't only the victory over a quality opponent that was 
impressive. The Tillers were able to beat a good team without two of their 
starters. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Thomas Clayton and Jason Moore did not play. Clayton was out with the 
flu and Moore, the Tillers' only returning starter, is out three weeks after 
dislocating a knee this season. 
</P>
<P>
"We were hoping to get by tonight without both of those guys," Tustin Coach Tom 
McCluskey said. "This tournament is going to be a big test for us." 
</P>
<P>
The Tillers (10-0) were held to one field goal in the final 6 minutes 20 
seconds but still managed to rally from a 45-42 deficit. They made seven of 10 
free throws in the final 3:37. 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's defense made that stand up. The Tillers held Huntington Beach (5-5) 
without a field goal in the final 5:21. 
</P>
<P>
It was the second scoreless streak of the game for the Oilers. Tustin held them 
scoreless for the first 5:44 of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
So Huntington Beach went 11 minutes of a 16-minute half without a field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach standout Mustapha Abdi was noticeably ineffective in the 
second half. Abdi had 10 points and 11 rebounds in the first half, but was held 
to three points and three rebounds in the second. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we executed very well on defense," McCluskey said. "I thought we did 
a good job of taking away their inside game." 
</P>
<P>
Tustin's Phuong Tran (16 points) made two free throws to tie the score, 46-46, 
with 2:48 left. Huntington Beach then self-destructed. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers turned the ball over twice and missed two free throws and a layup in 
the next 1:30. 
</P>
<P>
David Beilstein (17 points) made a jump shot and a free throw and Tran added a 
free throw to give the Tillers a 50-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Huntington Beach had two chances to tie the score in the final 10 seconds. But 
Dennis Callahan and James Dingus (12 points) missed three-pointers and Tustin 
remained undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be a challenge for us the next few days," McCluskey said. 
</P>
<P>
In other first-round games: 
</P>
<P>
Corona del Mar 64, Laguna Hills 57 -- After blowing a 10-point lead in the 
fourth quarter, the Sea Kings rallied for the victory. Laguna Hills, which 
trailed, 42-32, entering the fourth quarter, took a 53-51 lead on two free 
throws by Pat Nelson with 3:12 left. But the Sea Kings, led by Warren Johnson, 
went on a 13-4 run. Johnson scored 19 points, eight of which came in the final 
three minutes. John Paulsen added 17 points for Corona del Mar. Nelson scored 
14 points for Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 59, Costa Mesa 43 -- Mike Boucher scored 16 points to lead the 
Diablos, who built a big lead early. Mission Viejo led, 17-7, at the end of the 
first quarter and 38-15 at halftime. Xavier Hanna scored 18 points for Costa 
Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
Los Alamitos 70, Estancia Reserves 25 -- Robert Conlisk scored 17 points and 
Todd Chesebro 13 to lead the Griffins.

PARKS PUTS ON SHOW AS MARINA ENDS EL TORO'S WINNING STREAK

<P>
Cherokee Parks, Marina High School's 6-foot-11 junior center, has become one of 
the dominant prep basketball players in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
The predictions of greatness that have followed Parks since he played his first 
varsity game as a freshman are routinely being played out on the basketball 
court this season. 
</P>
<P>
Parks was impressive Wednesday night, scoring 37 points and grabbing 19 
rebounds in Marina's 82-71 overtime victory over El Toro in the second round of 
the Orange Holiday tournament at Chapman College's Hutton Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Parks missed only one shot and followed it with a stirring basket that helped 
Marina (8-4) advance to the semifinals against the county's top-ranked boys' 
team, Mater Dei, at 8:50 tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Parks scored on medium-range jumpers, short bank shots in traffic and 
crowd-pleasing dunks. He drew a crowd whenever he touched the ball, but he 
consistently scored at key points of the evenly matched game. 
</P>
<P>
Parks' biggest basket came with 19 seconds remaining in regulation play and 
Marina clinging to a 69-68 lead. Three players scrambled for a loose ball that 
squirted out of the pileup and into Parks' hands. He turned and made a shot 
that pushed Marina ahead, 71-68. 
</P>
<P>
But El Toro sent the game into overtime when Dan Somers made a three-point shot 
with six seconds remaining to tie the score, 71-71. El Toro (9-2) made 11 
three-point shots in an effort to keep pace with Parks, but the Chargers failed 
to score in the three-minute overtime. 
</P>
<P>
"It was important for us to come back after they tied the score on a 
last-second shot," said Steve Popovich, Marina's coach. "They started hitting 
threes, we started turning the ball over and then we couldn't make free throws. 
</P>
<P>
"But when it came time to win the game, Cherokee wanted it more than anybody. 
Playing Mater Dei will be good for us. We've got a shot at them, let's see what 
happens." 
</P>
<P>
Marina broke El Toro's nine-game winning streak by outscoring the Chargers, 
11-0, in overtime. Marina should have won the game in regulation, but guard Thi 
Nguyen missed the front end of three, one-and-one free-throw opportunities down 
the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
Parks sealed the victory with nine seconds remaining when he scored on a dunk. 
He made 14 of 15 field goals and nine of 11 free throws. Tim Casarez led El 
Toro with 19 points, and Somers scored 12 of his 18 points in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 68, Fountain Valley 40 -- Danny O'Neil scored 16 of his 17 points in 
the first half, including a pair of three-point shots for Mater Dei (10-1). 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 69, Santa Ana 40 -- Santa Ana's problems continued as the Saints 
(4-6) committed 27 turnovers and made only 18 of 50 shots. 
</P>
<P>
Andre McFarlane and Elton Moore each scored 16 points for Saddleback (9-4). 
</P>
<P>
Dominguez 47, Foothill 42 -- Foothill fell behind, 13-2, by committing nine 
turnovers in the first quarter and then rallied behind the play of forward Mark 
Wilkinson. 
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson scored 27 of his team's 42 points and gave Foothill (7-4) a 27-24 
lead with six minutes remaining. But Dominguez (10-1) made five of seven free 
throws down the stretch.

NEW CHIEF OF SAN CLEMENTE'S RIP CURL SEES WAVE BUILDING FOR BEACHWEAR FIRM 
</P>

<P>
The new president of Rip Curl, U.S.A., harbors some ambitious plans for the San 
Clemente-based maker of wet suits and beachwear. 
</P>
<P>
Kelley Woolsey envisions Rip Curl's wholesale sales climbing 50% within about a 
year. That would mean a jump to about $12 million by next fall, from the $8.4 
million reached in fiscal 1989 ended Sept. 30, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To help reach that goal, Woolsey said, Rip Curl is planning to expand its 
current product line of board shorts, walk shorts, knits, shirts and outer 
wear. Woolsey, 35, came to Rip Curl in November from O'Neill, the Santa Cruz 
manufacturer mostly known for its wet suits. He said he decided to make the 
switch because of "the potential to grow Rip Curl into a larger company." 
</P>
<P>
Woolsey was vice president of sales and marketing at O'Neill.

O.C. COMPUTER FIRMS ARE SPLIT ON PROSPECTS FOR 1990; 
</P>
<P>
SALES: EXPECTATIONS RANGE FROM SO-SO TO GREAT, BUT THE HIGH-TECH FIRMS ARE 
UNIFORMLY EXCITED ABOUT FOREIGN MARKETS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
With expectations ranging from the unexceptional to the strongly upbeat, Orange 
County computer companies' sales forecasts for 1990 are as diverse as the 
industry itself. 
</P>
<P>
Local computer firms are involved in many aspects of the computer business, 
from supplying software to manufacturing personal computers and distributing 
them to retailers. And their fortunes often are closely tied to the growth in 
their slice of the market. 
</P>
<P>
Companies that manufacture PCs and PC components are particularly enthusiastic 
about prospects for 1990. On the other hand, makers of minicomputers -- the 
size of computers between PCs and the largest mainframes -- report that they 
see little reason for cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The county's computer industry is expected to continue to grow in fits as it 
enters the new decade. In 1990, Western Digital of Irvine and Ingram Micro D of 
Santa Ana are likely to become the first county computer firms to hit the $1 
billion annual sales mark. 
</P>
<P>
One common thread among local companies is their enthusiasm about the prospects 
for doing more business overseas. With the promise of new markets opening in 
Eastern Europe and the development of other markets in Asia and elsewhere, many 
computer firms say foreign sales may providen their fastest sales growth in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
The majority of local computer firms are involved in the personal computer 
field. PC sales were dampened in 1989 because of widespread confusion over 
competing designs, industry officials say. A lot of that confusion has cleared, 
they say, and the outlook for 1990 is for generally strong, though not 
spectacular, growth. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's going to be a very good year for the industry," said Gene Lu, 
president of Advanced Logic Research Inc., an Irvine personal computer maker. 
"We've had a lot of confusion with these different industry standards. In 1990, 
I think all those issues will be clarified and it will be a matter of selection 
for buyers." 
</P>
<P>
But not everyone shares Lu's optimism. 
</P>
<P>
Dataquest Inc., a Silicon Valley market research firm, predicts that 23.3 
million PCs will be sold worldwide in 1990, an unexceptional 10% increase over 
1989. For an industry accustomed to 20% to 30% growth rates throughout most of 
the 1980s, a 10% growth could be considered relatively flat. However, some 
segments of the industry -- for example, companies that supply networks that 
link PCs within an office -- are expected to grow much faster than the overall 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Apple Computer Inc. surprised investment analysts when it 
said its sales would grow more slowly in 1990 than previously predicted. The 
Cupertino, Calif., computer maker said it expects U.S. sales to rise by 15% to 
18% next year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some people are skeptical about 1990," said AST Research President Safi U. 
Qureshey, "but we do not share that skepticism." Qureshey declined to provide a 
specific sales forecast for his company. 
</P>
<P>
Qureshey and other computer executives said one unknown factor that could 
affect sales is the health of the U.S. economy. "There is talk about a possible 
recession," he said. "If the economy really goes into the tank, our industry 
will be affected. But a minor economic slowdown will not have that much 
effect." 
</P>
<P>
Ingram Micro D, the nation's largest wholesaler of PC hardware and software, 
expects sales growth of more than 20% next year, said Chairman Linwood A. 
(Chip) Lacy. "There are a lot of exciting products coming in both hardware and 
software products." 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, new products and technology have been the keys to growth in the 
PC industry as computer users swap their older machines for faster, more 
powerful models. 
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say one key reason that PC sales stalled in 1989 was 
uncertainty over which of two competing PC design standards was technologically 
superior and likely to gain greater acceptance in the market. One standard was 
developed by International Business Machines and the other was proposed by nine 
PC manufacturers that compete with IBM. 
</P>
<P>
Now, it appears that the industry is making room for both PC standards. Some 
computer makers, such as Advanced Logic Research, are building PCs 
incorporating both designs: IBM's Micro Channel and the Extended Industry 
Standard Architecture (EISA) developed by Compaq Computer Corp. and other PC 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
Rainbow Technologies Inc. of Irvine, a supplier of software designed to protect 
the data in PCs, also sees a very strong year ahead, said Peter M. Craig, vice 
president of business development. Sales of the company's products are closely 
tied to overall sales of computer hardware. 
</P>
<P>
"We're coming off one of the best months we've ever had in December and are 
looking for continued growth in 1990," Craig said. "We haven't seen anything 
yet that would be of concern to us." 
</P>
<P>
Western Digital Chairman Roger W. Johnson said 1990 will be a "pretty good 
year" for the county's largest computer manufacturer. The company's sales have 
been flat throughout most of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't be surprised to see our sales growing at about 15% this year," he 
said. "Our order rates right now are the best they have been in 18 months." 
</P>
<P>
But companies that supply products for the minicomputer market are less cheery 
about 1990. They forecast conditions similar to those they had in 1989: 
sluggish growth. 
</P>
<P>
Minicomputer sales have been hurt by competition from sophisticated PCs and 
workstations that can perform the same tasks as many minicomputers but cost far 
less. 
</P>
<P>
Emulex Corp. Chairman Fred Cox is anticipating an increase in sales in early 
1990 after a sluggish 1989. The Costa Mesa company supplies storage products 
for minicomputers made by Digital Equipment Corp. and components for computers 
made by other manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
"It's tougher this year than it has been, but I think we have the potential for 
some growth," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Kleist, president of Printronix Inc., an Irvine maker of printers for 
minicomputers, says industry sales will be flat and "our sales will reflect 
that." He said Printronix is hoping that a new line of printer products will 
help invigorate sales. 
</P>
<P>
Printronix and other local companies are forecasting a more rapid growth in 
international sales than domestic sales in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"Europe looks very strong for us," Western Digital's Johnson said. "And if 
Eastern Europe continues the way it is going politically, that could be a net 
incremental boom to the whole industry." 
</P>
<P>
"We expect our international growth will be very strong in 1990," said Jim 
Farooquee, chairman of CMS Enhancements, a Tustin supplier of computer storage 
devices for PCs. Farooquee says CMS's 1990 sales will reflect the overall 
growth in the computer storage market, which is expected to grow 15% to 20%. 
</P>
<P>
CMS plans to open a sales office in Western Europe next year and is eyeing the 
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as ripe markets. 
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate a lot of new markets opening up in Eastern Europe," Farooquee 
said. 
</P>
<P>
And local firms hoping to tap into the Eastern European market may get some 
help from the Bush Administration. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said 
earlier this month that the administration is actively reviewing proposals to 
relax the ban on sale of high-technology exports to Warsaw Pact countries, the 
result of sweeping political changes occurring in the Communist bloc.

O! Deli Plans: If a San Francisco-based deli chain has its way, Orange County 
office workers will soon have a new alternative to ho-hum, brown-bag lunches. 
</P>
<P>
O! Deli Corp. has big plans to add 25 franchise deli restaurants by 1993 in the 
county's commercial buildings, industrial parks and business districts, company 
executives said. 
</P>
<P>
The idea behind the eateries is to cater to office workers who have just 45 
minutes for lunch each day, said Joe Sanfellipo, president of O! Deli. To speed 
up service, the company has developed a "Fax Food" menu. Order forms are left 
with office workers, who can fill them out and fax them into the local O! Deli. 
Orders are then picked up or delivered, Sanfellipo said. 
</P>
<P>
So far, O! Deli has 18 outlets in five states -- California, Colorado, 
Massachusetts, Florida and Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
By expanding through franchisees, Sanfellipo said, the company hopes to have 
six county sites up and running within a year. After that, "we think the Orange 
County market will hold 40 to 50 locations, but realistically, we're probably 
looking at 25" within three years, Sanfellipo said.

JOSEPH N. BELL: WHAT TO CALL THE '11-YEAR-OLD KID' GOING ON 13? NOW, THAT'S A 
PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The start of a new year seems a good time to assess the nomenclature of the 
11-year-old-kid-going-on-13. Several crucial things are now taking place in his 
life. In addition to turning the corner on the downhill slope to becoming a 
teen-ager, he has mastered -- more-or-less -- the task of taking out the trash 
each Wednesday morning and has also discovered girls. As girls. 
</P>
<P>
At such a watershed in his life, it seemed appropriate to discuss with him his 
views on his treatment in this column. He agreed that approaching the hallowed 
age of 13, he should probably no longer be referred to as the 11-year-old kid 
-- a change of position since last summer when he decidedly preferred that 
title. But that, of course, was before he found out for sure that he was going 
to have to take out the trash anyway. 
</P>
<P>
"So how," I asked him, "would you like to be referred to now?" 
</P>
<P>
He put down his Batman comic book and thought it over for at least 15 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
Then he said: "As the 13-year-old kid" -- and went back to his comic book. 
</P>
<P>
When I pressed him for an alternative -- pointing out that while this was 
mathematically correct, it showed a certain lack of imagery -- he couldn't come 
up with any. He said the 13-year-old-kid would be just fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
So I'm on my own. What I didn't explain to him is that we apparently need to do 
a nose job on his name. Cosmetics have entered the picture. 
</P>
<P>
A lot of people -- both editors and readers -- continue to feel that I am 
somehow demeaning my stepson by referring to him as the 11-year-old kid. What I 
can't seem to get across is that this is not a generic statement about the 
dignity of youth. It is quite simply a rather accurate expression of the 
relationship between two people: my stepson and me. He thinks it's funny. So do 
I. It also catches the flavor of the way we deal with one another. 
</P>
<P>
Columnist Mike Royko refers to his wife as "the blonde" in his column, which 
probably sets feminists' teeth to grinding coast to coast. But that is no more 
a statement about womanhood than the "11-year-old kid" is a statement about 
youth. It simply reflects the rapport between Royko and his wife. If she 
doesn't care -- or even finds it amusing -- why should anyone else? 
</P>
<P>
So I've resisted change, but he is clearly growing up, and I suppose that 
should be reflected in the way I refer to him in this column -- even if he 
prefers a slight modification of the old way. So I plan to come up with a new 
title. I'm not sure at this point exactly what it will be, but one of my New 
Year's resolutions is to find a way that can be at least marginally 
satisfactory to both of us. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, I'm making another resolution: to not back away from dealing with 
both personal and public issues in the year ahead with a quality called 
irreverence that seems to be in very short supply around here -- and quite 
possibly all over the country. My stepson was puzzled about the name change, 
and I thought about discussing the leavening quality of irreverence with him, 
but he's not quite ready for that yet. He understands it instinctively well 
enough that intellectualizing it would serve no purpose at this point. 
</P>
<P>
But we are surrounded by people who perpetually take themselves and their 
institutions too seriously, and the best antidote I know is irreverence, which 
is a much misunderstood quality. It is not cynicism, nor is it a tearing down 
of values and principles. The cynic has given up on humankind, and the 
revolutionary would rend its institutions and replace them with chaos. But the 
irreverent genuinely likes people and supports institutions by shaking them a 
little and saying, "C'mon, take a look at your own absurdities and mellow 
down." Irreverence -- which is effective only when it is couched in humor -- is 
the only known cure for a social disease called stuffiness. 
</P>
<P>
I'm as guilty as the next guy. I get carried away on some of my own crusades, 
but I'm lucky enough to have friends and family who pull me up short when I 
start taking myself too seriously. I can't imagine a greater service a friend 
can perform. 
</P>
<P>
If this seems a long way from changing the nomenclature for my stepson in this 
column, perhaps I've allowed myself to launch a mini-crusade from the fragile 
platform of letting go of an affectionate name. If so, I'm guilty as charged 
and will do penance by reading the collected speeches of Rep. William E. 
Dannemeyer. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "11-year-old kid" is dead. But long live "the 11-year-old kid."

<P>
When Ventura Cornejo purchased a new home on Lime Avenue in Cypress in 1962, 
the area surrounding the development consisted mostly of farmland and cow 
pastures. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress College, now the focal point of Cornejo's neighborhood, would not be 
built for another four years. For a while then, the Cornejo family could enjoy 
the quiet rural life. 
</P>
<P>
"Orange Avenue and Valley View Street were just little two-lane country roads 
back then," he says. "We used to complain about the smell coming from the dairy 
farms. But when the area started to develop and all the traffic started coming 
in, we decided the cows weren't so bad after all." 
</P>
<P>
The dairies and farmland are now long gone, of course. In their place is a 
bustling suburb of housing and commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
Still, despite the change, Cornejo and his wife, Lilly, have no immediate plans 
to leave the neighborhood that has been their home for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
"We raised five children here," said Cornejo, a real estate agent who serves on 
the local school board. "All my kids went to Christine Swain school just a few 
blocks away, and now two of my grandkids go there too." 
</P>
<P>
The school, at 5851 Newman St., was named for Christine Swain, who was head 
librarian at the Cypress Branch Library from 1959 to 1984. Swain, who is 
retired and still lives in Cypress, organized an after-school tutoring program 
for local children and served on the Cypress School District Board of Trustees 
for 30 years. This year, there are 407 pupils enrolled in grades kindergarten 
through six at Swain. 
</P>
<P>
Newman is also the street where William C. Horan and a roommate rented a small 
two-bedroom home in 1966 for $55 a month while he was attending Cypress 
College. "My roommate and I split the rent, so each of us paid only $27.50. I 
was going to school on GI Bill funds, and that helped me stretch my money a 
little further. I was in pretty good shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Horan was one of the 1,966 students who enrolled for the first semester at a 
campus that existed only on blueprints just 74 days before it opened. Known as 
"The Instant Campus," Cypress College originally consisted of 18 prefabricated 
temporary structures that took only a few months to put up. The gymnasium, 
classrooms and administrative offices were all in temporary buildings; the 
permanent structures were built over a period of about 15 years on the 112-acre 
site. 
</P>
<P>
Horan, now a lawyer living in Huntington Beach, had transferred from another 
community college and needed only 12 units to complete an associate of arts 
degree. He completed them all in that semester, making him the school's first 
graduate -- the valedictorian in a graduating class of one. 
</P>
<P>
Today, more than 13,257 students attend day and evening classes there. 
</P>
<P>
The modern and elegantly landscaped campus, and a number of its individual 
buildings, has received awards from architectural and educational associations. 
Two of its more notable features are the colorful abstract wall sculpture by 
Orange County artist Sergio O'Cadiz that forms the facade of the library 
building, and the 115-foot campanile that can be seen for miles from almost any 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
The design for the entire project is the work of William Blurock &amp; 
Associates of Newport Beach and Caudill-Rowlett-Scott of Houston, Tex. -- the 
same team that, in the mid-'80s, designed the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center.

TODOS HOLIDAY PARTY RAISES $12,000 FOR MEDICAL CARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
More than 150 St. Joseph Hospital supporters took time from their last-minute 
holiday shopping -- and $125 each from their holiday budgets -- to attend the 
12th annual Todos Seasonal Soiree. 
</P>
<P>
The dinner and silent auction, at the Ritz-Carlton in Dana Point on Dec. 20, 
netted $12,000, according to hospital foundation spokeswoman Deborah Wolfe. 
Proceeds will be used to underwrite medical aid provided to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Todos, Spanish for everyone, is the "introductory arm" of the hospital's 
support structure, said guest Charles Kovac, chairman of the hospital 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
"When people have a good experience at St. Joseph, or a member of their family 
has a good experience in treatment, they often ask, 'How can I give something 
back?' Todos is the place where we develop these potential friends," Kovac 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters gathered at cocktail hour in a hotel banquet room, where a few 
silent auction tables were set along one wall. Chatting in small groups among 
the rose-and-white trimmed dinner tables, guests seemed not to notice or not to 
mind the lack of hors d'oeuvres and absence of music. It was quiet. There was 
no food. And everyone seemed perfectly content. 
</P>
<P>
Seasonal good will? 
</P>
<P>
Soiree manners? 
</P>
<P>
"This is just a friendly group," said benefit chairman Frank Villalobos, who 
mingled with his wife, Jeanette. 
</P>
<P>
Villalobos, a cardiologist at St. Joseph for more than 20 years, said he was 
particularly proud of the hospital programs to aid the poor -- the designation 
of party proceeds. Last year, he said, the hospital provided about $9 million 
in free services to the needy. 
</P>
<P>
Todos President Andy Karlinski said the mission of his one-year tenure would be 
to increase membership. "We've got room for a few more 'everyones,' " Karlinski 
said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
Committee member Jana Burwell conversed with her husband, Douglas, and their 
friends William and Roz Ostermiller. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Burwell, another St. Joseph cardiologist, said he and his wife decided 
to join the support group shortly after the birth of their son three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"As a doctor you don't think of a hospital as a key part of the community -- 
it's the place you go to work," said Burwell. That attitude changed after his 
infant son got sick and had to be briefly hospitalized. "It occurred to me that 
if there weren't good hospitals, my son wouldn't have had a place to go. It 
occurred to me that we need to support the institutions in our community to 
make this society work." 
</P>
<P>
Browsing the silent auction tables were Kent Roberts and friend Gene 
Widdicombe. Roberts wore a full-length fur coat made from sea otter pelts -- 
the source of a few pointed jokes about the Exxon Valdez, a certain sheen on 
Roberts' coat and outrageous dry-cleaning bills. 
</P>
<P>
One of the merrier cocktailing groups included Melvyn and Pat Sterling, George 
and Kate Reeves, Charles Margines and his wife, Jevelyn Yonchar. 
</P>
<P>
The source of the group's bursts of laughter? Pat Sterling thought for a moment 
and then giggled. "Nope. No way. No comment." Another good joke off the record. 
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m. guests sat for dinner of Caesar salad, veal with lime and ginger 
sauce. Terry Eacobellis played holiday selections on piano.

MORNING BRIEFING: YOU CAN BE A GREAT COACH, BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PLAYERS

The North Carolina basketball team crept back into the Associated Press' top 25 
(No. 24) this week, but at 7-4 the Tar Heels are off to one of their worst 
starts ever under Coach Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
CBS college basketball analyst Billy Packer says: "Dean lost the bulk of his 
recruiting staff when Roy Williams (Kansas) and Ed Fogler (Wichita State, then 
Vanderbilt) moved to head coaching jobs. They were the guys with their 
tentacles out there checking on and getting to know kids. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a time when Carolina could mass-recruit five guys each year and it 
was deep in good ballplayers. Lately, it's been more of a case where they went 
out and got the guy they needed, be it a James Worthy, Sam Perkins, Kenny Smith 
or Brad Daugherty. 
</P>
<P>
"This way they could assure a lot of playing time for their stars, and it only 
hurt them when they had an injury to a key guy. The last couple of years, 
they've missed on the handpicked guy."

Trivia time: On Dec. 28, 1944, who became the first player to score eight 
points in an NHL game?

The ol' boy network: Few introductions will be necessary when Arkansas and

 -- Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors was an assistant under Frank Broyles at 
Arkansas for four years in the mid-1960s. 
</P>

Add bowls: Notre Dame middle linebacker Ned Bolcar, who will play his last 
collegiate game Monday night in the Orange Bowl, says: "It's going to be weird 
on Saturday afternoons watching the games on television and saying, 'I used to 
be out there, and the crowd would be cheering.' I stand on the sidelines once 
in a while and say, 'Holy smokes, this is great.' " 
</P>
<P>
Last add bowls: Alabama's Lamonde Russell, one of the Sugar Bowl participants 
who toured Bourbon Street in New Orleans, said: "You couldn't really tell if 
some of those people were men or women. If you wanted to talk to a girl, you 
sometimes had to ask if she was a girl. And even then, you didn't always know." 
</P>
<P>
Finding a bright spot: Cal State Dominguez Hills had a 33-21 halftime lead over 
Grand Canyon College, but Grand Canyon won, 107-78. "I was pleased with our 
showing in the first half," Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai said.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<P>
Rating the five best New Year's Day bowl games: 
</P>
<P>
1. Orange Bowl. Colorado can clinch the national championship, and should, 
against a Notre Dame team that usually stinks out the joint in Miami. The Irish 
will be in big trouble against the quicker Buffaloes if Rocket Ismail is slowed 
by a shoulder injury. . . . 2. Rose Bowl. Bo Schembechler's retirement makes 
this special. The Wolverines used to lose in Pasadena because they couldn't 
pass. Now they are well-balanced (2,380 yards running, 1,818 passing). But the 
key is the young USC quarterback, Todd Marinovich, who must regain his form 
after an off day against UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
3. Fiesta Bowl. Florida State is playing better than anyone in the nation after 
losing its first two games. Coming off a rare win over Oklahoma, Nebraska will 
keep it close, high-scoring and entertaining. . . . 
</P>
<P>
4. Sugar Bowl. Kickoff will be about a half-hour after the Orange Bowl starts, 
and by the fourth quarter, Miami could be shooting for a national title. An 
upset might silence Bill Curry's critics at Alabama -- at least for a month or 
two. . . . 
</P>
<P>
5. Cotton Bowl. In Arkansas and Tennessee they care very much about this 
neighborhood brawl, but it will draw a yawn from the rest of the country. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The best musical show will be in Pasadena, where the always powerful Michigan 
band is matched against colorful USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Trojan wide receiver John Jackson has completed the grand slam of athletic and 
academic honors. A 3.30 GPA graduate in business who is working on his master's 
degree, Jackson has won an NCAA postgraduate scholarship, been named to the 
NCAA Top Six and been selected as a National Football Foundation 
scholar-athlete, Woody Hayes scholar-athlete and first-team GTE academic 
All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The rising star at NBC, Joel Meyers, will announce the Freedom Bowl on TV 
Saturday and the Rose Bowl on radio Monday. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Florida running back Emmitt Smith will be the center of attention in the 
Freedom, but Washington center Bern Brostek is projected to be a first-round 
draft choice. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The AFC and NFC wild-card games each would receive more attention if they were 
played on different days, but TV ratings are better on Sunday than on Saturday. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
By now, we've gotten used to playoffs without the Raiders, Dolphins and 
Cowboys. But no Bears, either? . . . 
</P>
<P>
If you're looking for a couple of sleepers to make it to the Super Bowl, try 
the Rams and Browns. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Three of the top four offensive teams in the AFC didn't get into the playoffs 
-- and neither did three of the top five defensive teams. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Lasorda says the first time he met Billy Martin was on the diamond. But the 
sport was boxing. "I was pitching for Kansas City against the Yankees in 1956," 
the Dodger manager recalled. "I threw at him. A fight broke out. It wasn't long 
after, though, that we became friends. You just had to be in the same room with 
the guy for an hour to love him." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Lasorda on Martin, the manager: "He knew how to motivate people. That made him 
a winner." . . . 
</P>
<P>
Regardless of his numbers, Brett Hull isn't half the hockey player his father 
Bobby was. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The change in the style of play in the NHL is reflected in the statistics of 
Doug Harvey, the Hall of Fame defenseman who died Tuesday at 65. The most goals 
he scored in a single season was nine. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Robb Stauber, the goaltender out of the University of Minnesota who made Mark 
Fitzpatrick expendable, still hasn't played for the Kings' New Haven farm club 
because of groin and back injuries. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Look-alikes: Jerry Burns and Burgess Meredith. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The more thoroughbred racing there is, the less predictable it gets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
What a pleasure it is to hear Trevor Denman call the races at Santa Anita 
again. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Their last 0.2-second defeat to the Celtics was just another step in the 
learning process for the young Clippers. What they learned is that it helps to 
be part of the NBA Establishment when crucial calls are made by officials. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
Who else but Larry Bird and Magic Johnson did you expect to decide the outcomes 
of two games in the same city the same night with free throws? . . . 
</P>
<P>
NFL take note: The Clipper-Celtic game was long by NBA standards. It lasted 2 
hours 15 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to rap the Boston hierarchy for not keeping up with the Lakers, but 
this would be a much different club if not for the Len Bias tragedy and the 
defection of Brian Shaw to Italy. . . . 
</P>
<P>
No team with Akeem Olajuwon in the lineup should have a losing record. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Michigan will be the sentimental favorite on the moon Monday. Three Apollo 15 
crew members who are graduates of the university left a UM flag there.

HOFSTRA (3-5) at CAL STATE LONG BEACH (6-2), 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
TV -- None. Radio -- None. 
</P>
<P>
After Long Beach lost to Nevada Las Vegas, 78-58, Tuesday, 49er Coach Joe 
Harrington said, "It's only one loss, and we can't let that affect what we have 
done so far this season." The 49ers shot only 27% from the field at Las Vegas. 
Long Beach, 3-0 at home, is led by forward Kevin Cutler, who is averaging 13.3 
points a game. Hofstra University, of Hempstead, N.Y., is coached by Butch van 
Breda Kolff, 67, who coached the Lakers in the late 1960s. Van Breda Kolff is 
in the second season of his second tenure with Hofstra. He led the Flying 
Dutchmen to five 20-victory seasons in the '50s.

Guard Robert Pack, who scored 23 points in a 76-73 victory over St. Francis 
last weekend, has averaged 18 points and 5.7 assists in his last three games 
while shooting 67% from the field. Forward Ronnie Coleman needs 25 points to 
move into 20th place on USC's career scoring list. Coleman has scored 880 
points in 66 games. Central Connecticut's only win was an 83-55 victory over 
Post College, a NAIA school from Waterbury, Conn.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

VALVANO, N.C. STATE WIN REUNION, 92-72 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jim Valvano and Pat Kennedy returned to their coaching roots Wednesday, 
Valvano's North Carolina State Wolfpack beating Kennedy's Florida State team, 
92-72, in the opening round of the ECAC Holiday Festival in Madison Square 
Garden at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Seton Hall beat Rhode Island, 68-62, in the other game and will meet N. C. 
State in Friday's final. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy was an assistant under Valvano for six years at Iona, in nearby New 
Rochelle, N.Y., and both went from the Gaels to bigger things. Kennedy assumed 
Iona's head coaching spot when Valvano went to N. C. State in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
Familiarity bred preparedness. "We were ready for the trick defenses they tried 
and they were well-prepared for us," Kennedy said. "That's just an extension of 
us knowing each other so well." 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State's backcourt of Rodney Monroe and Chris Corchiani lived up to its 
billing. Considered one of the best guard tandems in the nation, Monroe had 35 
points and Corchiani had 16 assists for the 19th-ranked Wolfpack (8-2). 
Corchiani matched the tournament's single-game assist record and added 14 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Corchiani added an impressive defensive performance against Theron Mayes, 
Florida State's leading scorer at 24.3 points per game. Mayes finished with 11 
points on five-for-16 shooting, including one for six from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
N.C. State took charge late in the first half with a 9-0 run that gave the 
Wolfpack a 51-39 lead with 1:25 left after the score had been tied seven times. 
</P>
<P>
"We played a good first 10 minutes and they took over for the other 30," 
Kennedy said, whose Seminoles are 6-4. "Corchiani did a nice job on Mayes, a 
real nice job there." 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Oklahoma 142, James Madison 109 -- William Davis continued his streak of 
double figures in scoring and rebounding in leading the Sooners to their 35th 
consecutive victory at Norman, Okla. 
</P>
<P>
Davis had 33 points and 10 rebounds and has reached double figures in both 
categories in all six Oklahoma games. 
</P>
<P>
The Sooners (6-0) scored 88 second-half points and raised their nation-leading 
scoring average to 136 points per game. 
</P>
<P>
Davis sparked a run of 13 consecutive points that gave Oklahoma a 44-26 lead 
with 3:48 left in the half. Davis scored five points during the 3 1/2-minute 
run and set up two other baskets with steals. 
</P>
<P>
The Dukes (5-4) were led by Steve Hood's 36 points, and Claude Ferdinand and 
Fess Irvin, with 22 each. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Missouri 71, No. 15 Memphis State 65 -- John McIntyre scored five points 
in the final 1:43 to boost Missouri at Memphis, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State led, 65-61, when McIntyre hit a three-pointer from the baseline. 
Then he stole a pass and drove the length of the floor for a dunk to give 
Missouri a 66-65 lead, the Tigers' first since the 10:14 mark. 
</P>
<P>
Doug Smith sank three free throws in the final 20 seconds to seal the victory. 
Smith finished with 10 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
The victory gave Missouri of the Big Eight a 10-1 record. Memphis State of the 
Metro Conference dropped to 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
No. 10 Indiana 75, Wichita State 54 -- Calbert Cheaney and Eric Anderson scored 
17 points apiece for the Hoosiers, who beat the Shockers in the first round of 
a tournament at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M beat Loyola, Ill., 64-61, in the other game to earn the right to 
play Indiana for the championship of a tournament in which the Hoosiers have 
never lost. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana (9-0) used its eighth different starting lineup and went on a 16-2 run 
to roll to a 42-26 halftime lead. Wichita State was held to 30% shooting in the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
No. 14 Georgia Tech 98, Morehead State 76 -- Brian Oliver scored 23 points and 
Dennis Scott added 21 for the Yellow Jackets in the opening game of a 
tournament at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech (7-0) scored 32 points in the first 10 minutes and led, 51-26, at 
the half. It cruised the rest of the way to an easy victory over the Eagles 
(5-4). 
</P>
<P>
Georgia Tech freshman Kenny Anderson scored 16 points and had 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
No. 17 St. John's 77, Howard 65 -- At New York, Greg Harvey had 17 points in a 
balanced attack as the Redmen ran their winning streak to five games. 
</P>
<P>
Malik Sealy had 16 points for St. John's (10-2). Jayson Williams had 14 and 
Billy Singleton and Robert Werdann each had 11. 
</P>
<P>
The teams traded scoring spurts before the Redmen went on a 13-4 burst to take 
a 40-31 lead at the half. 
</P>
<P>
Tyrone Powell led the Bison (2-7), who lost their fifth game in a row, with 16 
points. 
</P>
<P>
No. 20 La Salle 74, Ohio State 62 -- Doug Overton and Randy Woods used 
quickness to spark a run against the Buckeyes, and Lionel Simmons scored 26 
points to lead the Explorers in the opening game of the Sugar Bowl tournament. 
</P>
<P>
La Salle is 6-0. Ohio State 4-4. 
</P>
<P>
The Explorers meet Florida, a 69-64 winner over New Orleans in the other 
semifinal game, in tonight's championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Overton had two steals, and he and Woods each had seven points during a 17-4 
surge over the first 4:05 of the second half as La Salle overcame a 32-30 
deficit to take a 47-36 lead. 
</P>
<P>
Simmons scored five of his points in the final 1:28 of the game as Ohio State 
(4-4) tried to rally. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Carter led Ohio State with 23 points. It was the third loss to a ranked 
team this season for the Buckeyes, who dropped earlier contests North Carolina 
State, then ranked 15th in the nation, and Oklahoma State when it was ranked 
24th. 
</P>
<P>
No. 24 North Carolina 121, Kentucky 110 -- Rick Fox scored 15 points to help 
the Tar Heels build a 28-point lead midway through the first half at 
Louisville, Ky., in a meeting of college basketball's all-time winningest 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina (7-4) registered its 1,465th victory; Kentucky has 1,469. The 
Tar Heels hold a 14-6 series lead, including four victories in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (5-4) set an NCAA record with 21 three-point goals, but it wasn't 
enough to overcome North Carolina's superior size and shooting. North Carolina 
made 10 of 20 three-pointer attempts, and the total three-pointers by the two 
teams also was a record. 
</P>
<P>
The previous record for combined three-point goals was 29 by Valparaiso and 
Butler on Feb. 6, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Fox hit three three-pointers as North Carolina took a 48-20 advantage with 8:13 
remaining in the half. The Tar Heels also had a 19-4 edge in rebounds during 
the spurt as they worked inside for easy shots. 
</P>
<P>
King Rice led North Carolina with a career-high 22 points and had 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
Deron Feldhaus scored a career-high 27 points for Kentucky.

By DAN SULLIVAN, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Theater in the 1980s continued its usual business of dying and coming to birth. 
Opportunities were met and missed, change was embraced and avoided, and nothing 
went according to the subscription brochure. An actor became President of the 
United States and promptly cut the arts budget. A playwright went from a prison 
cell in Czechoslovakia to a leading role in that country's government. 
</P>
<P>
Who could have predicted any of it? The most shocking turn of events was the 
AIDS epidemic. It cut a path through a whole generation of American theater 
people -- strict classicists like John Hirsch, zanies like Charles Ludlam and 
more good workaday directors and actors than bears thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
The musical theater was especially hard hit. One of the most painful losses was 
that of Michael Bennett, creator of "A Chorus Line," who had 20 more terrific 
musicals in him. We got only one of them -- "Dreamgirls." Other illnesses 
claimed Gower Champion and Bob Fosse, and by the end of the decade the Broadway 
musical had lost its bearings. 
</P>
<P>
Broadway still had blockbuster musicals, but they came from Britain, where 
producer Cameron Mackintosh and composer Andrew Lloyd Webber had discovered 
that the way to an audience's heart is through its nerve endings. Give them a 
simple plot, an eye-popping set and a score that left no doubt about what 
emotion they were supposed to be feeling, and they would be lined up for 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
What was good about Lloyd Webber's musicals was that they were music-driven -- 
they weren't plays with music. What was bad about them was the cheapness of 
that music. But they sold and sold -- particularly "The Phantom of the Opera." 
Stephen Sondheim had his successes, too, with "Into the Woods" and "Sunday in 
the Park With George." But Sondheim's meaning takes time to grasp, while Lloyd 
Webber's is instantly familiar. Like it or not, he was the theater composer of 
the decade. 
</P>
<P>
The playwright of the decade? No single voice emerged. The old reliables kept 
producing (it was the decade of Neil Simon's "Brighton Beach" trilogy) and so 
did the new reliables (although Sam Shepard and David Mamet were spending more 
time at the movies). 
</P>
<P>
Many of the newer voices were female -- Marsha Norman, Beth Henley, Wendy 
Wasserstein, Los Angeles' Marlane Meyer, the latter's a very tough voice 
indeed. South Coast Repertory helped showcase new writers like Keith Reddin and 
Craig Lucas, whose "Blue Window" and "Three Postcards" may have been the best 
yuppie plays of the decade. Los Angeles' John Steppling kept patrolling his 
beat, and you hoped it wouldn't prove to be a blind alley. Howard Korder (we 
had his "Boys' Life" at the Los Angeles Theatre Center) explored the age-old 
question: "What do men really want?" 
</P>
<P>
But the playwright who took the biggest steps was August Wilson. Being black 
himself, he wrote about black people, but there was a universality here that 
went beyond race. Earthy as Wilson's plays were -- "Fences," for instance, set 
in the plain-dirt front yard of a Pittsburgh garbage collector -- they weren't 
quite of this Earth. Wilson was the first playwright since O'Neill who really 
believed in ghosts: in forces out there in the dark that didn't necessarily 
wish human beings well. One could call it an African sensibility but it was 
equally a Greek sensibility, and Wilson's protagonists had the size of tragic 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
This was a surprise. Tragedy was supposed to have dried up around the time the 
universe went dead, circa "Waiting for Godot." But in Wilson's play the 
universe was a living mystery again. 
</P>
<P>
His voice wasn't the only one that contradicted Western rationalism. The Los 
Angeles Theatre Center gave access to Latino playwrights who saw dreams and 
reality as being different aspects of the same thing -- with dreams possibly 
coming closer to the heart of the matter. (Jose Rivera's "The Promise" was one 
such play.) 
</P>
<P>
And a young Chinese-American writer, David Henry Hwang, suggested in "M. 
Butterfly" that the "realistic" Westerner is the biggest dreamer of them all, 
confusing the world as it is with the world as he wishes it to be. 
</P>
<P>
The most interesting plays of the 1980s suggested that the world cannot be 
reduced to a computer print-out, useful to keep in mind as the certainties of 
the Cold War collapsed at the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Such plays tended to come from "minority" writers. But the phrase was beginning 
to date. At least in cities like Los Angeles, it was evident that we were all 
"minorities" now, and that we had to learn to pool our information. The Mark 
Taper Forum did its part here, but it was at LATC that one felt a real effort 
to incorporate non-white thinking (not just non-white actors) into the program. 
What would we have done without this imaginative, gutsy theater in the '80s? 
</P>
<P>
As for our leading minority theaters, the East-West Players, the Bilingual 
Foundation of the Arts, the Inner City Cultural Center -- they kept keeping on, 
but without breakthroughs. Amazingly, the decade saw not one play about Los 
Angeles' Korean community. How so? 
</P>
<P>
The Mark Taper Forum did have a good deal to do with the planning of the 
Olympic Arts Festival in 1984, the most adventurous spread of world theater 
ever presented in the United States. We can still see those samurai horsemen 
dashing in, in Le Theatre du Soleil's "Richard II." 
</P>
<P>
Only slightly less sumptuous was the 1987 Los Angeles Festival, its highlight 
being Peter Brook's all-day staging of "The Mahabharata." Here, again, a 
magnificent theatrical legend offered another way of looking at things -- 
things that had to be looked at if the planet wasn't to become a wheel of fire. 
</P>
<P>
Brook's staging also offered faces of black, brown, beige and ivory, all seen 
as kinsmen, albeit warring kinsmen. This wasn't "color-blind casting," but a 
notification that the variety of the human tribe is one of its strengths. Who 
wants to hear the same old song over and over? "The Mahabharata" was a shaping 
experience, although hard on the tail-bone, and Peter Sellars' 1990 "Third 
World L.A. Festival" will extend that experience, if we look at it through the 
right eyes. 
</P>
<P>
One of the laments of the decade was: "Whatever Happened to the 1960s?" This 
was a good way to avoid taking responsibility for the present -- as if to say 
that political protest had to have the sanction of intellectual fashion to be 
worth one's time. 
</P>
<P>
The American theater produced exactly one critique of the Reagan years, a mild 
spoof entitled "Rap Master Ronnie." After Vietnam, it just wasn't trendy to do 
political theater any more. Besides the issues were too complex. Larry Kramer's 
"The Normal Heart" was the only play that had the guts to attack a government 
official by name (New York's Mayor Koch, for failing to move on the AIDS crisis 
early enough). "Whatever Happened to the 1960s" in theater was that people got 
tired of fighting its battles -- or joined the other side. 
</P>
<P>
But the experimental theater of the 1960s had a victory. Two of the biggest 
hits of the 1980s were audience-participation events -- "Tamara" and "Tony 'n 
Tina's Wedding." As envisioned by experimental-theater directors like Richard 
Schechner 20 years before, the wall between performers and viewers had come 
crashing down, and "theater" was now something that both parties improvised 
together on the spot. Well, not quite. "Tamara" simply allowed the viewer to 
wander around a pre-set story, while "Tony 'n Tina's Wedding" merely offered 
him the role of a wedding guest -- not that great a challenge. Still, there was 
a fluidity here that wasn't found in traditional theater, and people enjoyed 
playing the game. 
</P>
<P>
The '90s would bring more "environmental" pieces, but the fourth wall would not 
disappear. Audiences never tire of that game too.

THE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN, TIMES ARTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
No one, a year ago today, would have dared to predict the astonishing political 
events that have made 1989 a year to remember forever. 
</P>
<P>
No one would have said that mass demonstrations for a more responsive, 
democratic government would erupt in monolithic China, only to be put down 
brutally (but almost certainly temporarily). No one could have guessed that 
hard-line governments would be swept aside, quite peaceably, in East Germany, 
nor that the hated Wall would come down and be sold off in souvenir hunks, nor 
that in Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the demand for freedom would burst 
forth like spring flowers through a frozen crust. No one would have seen a 
different kind of bursting forth in Romania, the urge toward freedom erupting 
there as from a long-festering infection, in a bloody and terrible cleansing. 
</P>
<P>
And what seems impressively true is that in all these unparalleled and 
unforeseen upheavals -- including the earlier incarnations of glasnost and 
perestroika in the Soviet Union itself -- the artists, and most especially the 
writers, can be seen to have played a significant role. 
</P>
<P>
The poets, the playwrights, the underground essayists and pamphleteers, 
circulating their manifestoes on precious, hand-typed copies, kept alive the 
dream and the possibility of a different, better day. 
</P>
<P>
It takes no great stretch of the imagination to compare the influence of the 
samizdat writers in the Soviet Union and authors such as Vaclav Havel in 
Czechoslovakia with the role played by Tom Paine and the other firebrands of 
freedom in the American Colonies immediately before 1776. 
</P>
<P>
"Brightest in dungeons, Liberty! thou art," Lord Byron cried in his "Sonnet on 
Chillon" in the early 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
In our century, only a month before his assassination, John F. Kennedy said in 
a speech at Amherst College: 
</P>
<P>
"When power leads man toward arrogance, poetry reminds him of his limitations. 
When power narrows the areas of man's concerns, poetry reminds him of the 
richness and diversity of his experience. When power corrupts, poetry cleanses, 
for art establishes the basic human truths which must serve as the touchstones 
of our judgment." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier in 1963, Kennedy had also said, in a speech at Vanderbilt: "Liberty 
without learning is always in peril, and learning without liberty is always in 
vain." 
</P>
<P>
Liberty in our time occasionally sounds worn and thin, from overuse in 
political oratory, but in 1989 it has become new-minted. 
</P>
<P>
Art has as many functions as it has forms, and in Hollywood it is inevitable to 
see art at its most diverting, escapist, simplistic and, more often than not, 
entertainingly trivial. Yet several of the offerings at year's end have been 
quickening reminders that the range of film, for example, is from the sublimely 
silly to abrasive confrontations with the hard truths of our time. "Born on the 
Fourth of July" and "Triumph of the Spirit" are engrossing, but they are not 
trivial. 
</P>
<P>
There will in time (quick time, probably) be films drawn from the happenings of 
1989; with luck and skill they may reflect not only the human drama but the 
whole astonishing historical context of these days. 
</P>
<P>
It seems obvious that the extraordinary scene-shifts in Eastern Europe, most 
especially, groundswells in which the urgings of the artists have figured 
significantly, have now created new and probably even more difficult challenges 
for the writers and the arts communities in their chaotic countries. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, of course, has gone from prisoner of conscience to a significant role in 
the leadership of his country (in itself a remarkable tribute to the potency of 
the artist in the shaping of society). 
</P>
<P>
The new challenges will be nothing so clear-cut as individual liberty against a 
ruthless oligarchy. The analogies to the American Revolution may be appropriate 
again: liberty achieved, followed by rancorous, dangerous philosophical and 
personal divisions over the nature of government, the apportioning of power, 
questions of economic and other controls. 
</P>
<P>
Freedom, elusive but grasped at last, makes more dramatic reading. It will be 
left to the artists, as it usually is, to evoke and to sustain amidst the hard 
times and the uncertainties their encompassing vision of the new day, the new 
year, the new century.

STAGE WATCH: 'PHANTOM OF THE OPERA' STANDS OUT IN HUMDRUM YEAR; 
</P>
<P>
THEATER: APART FROM THE AHMANSON'S ANDREW LLOYD WEBBER SUCCESS, THE CITY'S 
STAGES WERE OCCUPIED MAINLY BY NON-ROOF-RAISERS.

<P>
The best way to assess a theater year is not to turn to the scrapbook for a 
memory jog. If something hasn't stuck in the mind, it wasn't meant to stick 
there. 
</P>
<P>
So off the top of the head, and with the usual run of exceptions, 1989 has been 
a humdrum year -- a year when the wheels turned but their progress was rarely 
visible. 
</P>
<P>
It was, of course, the year that "The Phantom of the Opera" descended upon, 
invaded, overtook and devoured Los Angeles, bouncing the Center Theatre 
Group/Ahmanson season from the Ahmanson Theatre (chandeliered up for "Phantom") 
to the Doolittle in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
All to the good. Artistic director Gordon Davidson, who did double duty running 
the Mark Taper Forum and the Ahmanson/Doolittle, showed no visible signs of 
wear. 
</P>
<P>
But neither was either season particularly distinguished. Tom Stoppard's 
"Hapgood" (Doolittle) was a brilliant logistical exercise that was not 
sufficiently well performed and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (Doolittle) 
suffered from too much Glenda Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
The Taper, meanwhile, struggled with lofty intentions that did not make lofty 
plays (Jon Robin Baitz's "Dutch Landscape" and Vaclav Havel's "Temptation"), 
raising its head with Manuel Puig's "The Mystery of the Rose Bouquet," but 
scoring a real triumph only with "Stand-Up Tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The latter began life in the Taper, Too which produced some of the year's best 
work. Aside from "Tragedy," it had two other winners: Jose Ignacio Cabrujas' 
"The Day You'll Love Me" and Robert Holman's "Making Noise Quietly" -- studies 
in contrast unified by superb calibration. 
</P>
<P>
"Tragedy," set in a tough New York neighborhood Catholic school for boys, 
throbbed with high-octane energy; the Cabrujas piece, about three Venezuelan 
sisters in love with the idea as much as the person of the legendary singer 
Carlos Gardel, wore a seductive Chekhovian smile; "Making Noise," which hardly 
made any, was a trio of nearly-still lifes that spoke volumes between the 
lines. 
</P>
<P>
And it wasn't the only Taper sub-venue to surpass the Taper. Its Literary 
Cabaret at the Itchey Foot Ristorante as usual had terrific surprises. This 
year's were George C. Wolfe's "Spunk" (an adaptation of stories by Zora Neale 
Thurston) and Brian Nelson's "Joy Luck Club" (an excerpt from Amy Tan's novel 
of the same name; it has four more performances, Saturday and Jan. 6 and 7). 
</P>
<P>
The mystery: Why doesn't the Taper do in the Taper what it does so well 
everywhere else? 
</P>
<P>
Slightly rearranged, the question might apply to the Los Angeles Theatre Center 
which continued its wild artistic swings as well as its battle of the budget. 
Survival on Spring Street is still not assured, but it should be. If only for 
the dazzling part of this theater's eclectic, even courageous menu. 
</P>
<P>
Examples: Thomas Babe's laconic "Demon Wine," Reza Abdoh's overpopulated but 
arresting "Minimata" and the sheer snap of Christopher Durang's "The Marriage 
of Bette &amp; Boo." 
</P>
<P>
In an otherwise subdued season, South Coast Repertory's "You Never Can Tell" 
reinforced its image as a first-rate institution on any scale. And even though 
the Pasadena Playhouse didn't come up with a blockbuster in the order of 
"Mail," it continued to flex real muscle, most obviously with Rupert Holmes' 
mystery comedy thriller, "Accomplice." 
</P>
<P>
Significantly, 1989 was also the first year in 17 that the smaller theaters of 
Los Angeles functioned without the free-for-all of the Equity Waiver Plan 
(whereby Actors' Equity, the actors' union, "waived" certain rules in theaters 
with 99 seats or fewer). The Actors' 99-Seat Theatre Plan which has replaced it 
(a modification that includes a mandatory minimum payment of $5 per actor per 
performance) has not rocked any prosceniums. So far. Life in the theater has 
gone on with only a normal rate of attrition. 
</P>
<P>
In the realm of the "institutional" smaller theaters -- those with identity and 
track record -- Theatre 40 did distinguished revivals of Agatha Christie's "The 
Unexpected Guest" and David Storey's "Home." Such perennial dependables as the 
Cast seemed unstoppable. Artistic co-directors Ted Schmitt and Diana Gibson 
cranked out a full slate of new plays, of which one -- Raymond J. Barry's "Once 
in Doubt" -- bounced from there into the lap of the regular season at LATC. A 
first for both. 
</P>
<P>
The Padua Hills Playwrights' Festival, which has had as many ups and downs as 
the decade itself, seemed to recover its stride on the Cal State Northridge 
campus. It offered enough vigorous new work (especially Julie Hebert's "Almost 
Asleep"), to put some recent lackluster years securely behind it. 
</P>
<P>
The most serious loss on the smaller theater front, after 10 distinguished 
years, was the Back Alley Theatre. The wide-stage house on Burbank Boulevard in 
Van Nuys closed its doors in October with a stylish production of Matthew 
Witten's "The Deal." 
</P>
<P>
Producing co-director Allan Miller would not say if the Back Alley will be 
back. "We're maintaining the organization and several board members and will be 
discussing things in the coming months." A talked-about move to a larger space 
is off for now, he said, "but it's still a dream we have." 
</P>
<P>
The Back Alley had given us another of the year's best memories: a deliciously 
giddy production of John Olive's "Voice of the Prairie," about the early days 
of radio and the telling of tall tales, that relished the spoken word. 
</P>
<P>
We didn't lose the Odyssey Theatre Ensemble. It lost its home of 16 years and 
was forced to move from the corner of Bundy Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard 
to temporary quarters at 2055 S. Sepulveda Blvd. Temporary is the keyword here. 
Production continues, but the move was twice as expensive as originally 
anticipated (up to $140,000 and still counting). Artistic director Ron Sossi, 
who has been trying to make the leap to a union house for several years, 
insists this won't delay him. 
</P>
<P>
For the rest, here's a bag of random thoughts: 
</P>
<P>
* The Westwood Playhouse had a lackluster year that ended in a change of 
management. The new team of Eric Krebs and Howard Pechet didn't give it the 
hoped-for lift with their inaugural show ("The Eighties"), but at least they 
produced it and aren't dedicated to just booking the house. 
</P>
<P>
* After 25 years, East-West Players replaced its founding artistic director 
Mako with Nobu McCarthy. It's too soon to tell how the change will affect this 
theater. Its recent revival of, of all things, "Company" was well received, but 
we still haven't seen a new drama there from Thailand or Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
* The Inner City Cultural Center acquired the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood as a 
place to move shows with long-run potential. But the Ivar, which housed porno 
stage shows for the past 10 years, needs some major refurbishing (for which 
money has yet to be raised) and how many long-running shows can we reasonably 
expect? 
</P>
<P>
* Chicago's Second City comedy troupe arrived in Santa Monica, but its 
satirical impact on Southern California has been disappointingly minor, 
particularly when measured against the lively chomp of our very own Groundlings 
and some of the city's younger and wilder comedy troupes. The fact that it's 
gone through a couple of artistic directors already may mean that it's well 
aware of all this. 
</P>
<P>
* Finally, inevitably, we come to the Los Angeles Civic Light Opera which this 
year decided it was OK to deliver plays instead of musicals. One can be 
grateful for "Driving Miss Daisy" and "Steel Magnolias," but why present them 
under the LACLO banner? 
</P>
<P>
To the specious argument that there is "not enough product" (the reigning 
rationale of the '80s), we submit that Long Beach Civic Light Opera managed to 
blossom in this decade and that Tyne Daly was seen at the Dorothy Chandler 
Pavilion only last summer in the strongest revival of "Gypsy" this side of 
Angela Lansbury.

A CRITICAL OVERVIEW: THE BEST OF THEATER '89 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
South Coast Repertory brought 19th-Century England to life in two productions 
last spring: David Emmes' airy staging of Shaw's "You Never Can Tell" and 
Stephen Jeffreys' complex adaptation of Dickens' "Hard Times" -- a remarkable 
demonstration of the power of the imagination and of the actor's ability to 
ignite it, marred only by weaknesses in the musical department. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first of two shows called "Hard Times" that I reviewed and liked 
this year. The other was a Company of Angels adaptation of Studs Terkel's 
scrapbook about the Depression -- and its actors filled as many roles as those 
doing the Dickens, though on a much smaller scale. 
</P>
<P>
The most striking piece of new work I reviewed was Reza Abdoh and Mira-Lani 
Oglesby's "Minamata" at Los Angeles Theatre Center. This performance collage, 
taking off from the industrial poisoning of a Japanese fishing village, was 
seriously weakened by its creator's self-indulgence, but it included enough 
tantalizing imagery to keep me hooked through two viewings. The LATC production 
was remarkably assured -- the best-mounted example of large-scale home-grown 
performance art that Los Angeles has seen. 
</P>
<P>
None of the new plays I reviewed this year was a total success, but some of the 
brighter elements included Julie Harris in "Driving Miss Daisy" (Henry Fonda 
Theatre), several performances in "The Boys Next Door" (Pasadena Playhouse), 
the exchanges of stories in Suzanne Lummis' "Night Owls" (Cast Theatre), the 
knockabout fun of "Our Lady of the Tortilla" (Bilingual Foundation of the Arts) 
and the antic monologues of Christopher Durang's "Laughing Wild" (Long Beach 
Studio Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
Enterprising revivals included Michael Arabian's hyperactive staging of Frank 
Wedekind's "Spring Awakening" (Odyssey Theatre) and an intriguingly revised 
version of the musical revue "Bittersuite" (Burbage Theatre). 
</P>
<P>
"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" was the funniest thing yet 
seen at California Music Theatre, and a new professional company in Simi 
Valley, Santa Susana Rep, did well by "Man of La Mancha" in a tent. 
</P>
<P>
Finally, Brain Trust's comedy revue, "Mental Cruelty" (Tamarind) was an 
invigorating surprise in an overcrowded genre.

'FOURTH,' 'HARRY/SALLY,' 'GLORY' LEAD GLOBES NODS

"Born on the Fourth of July," "Glory," and "When Harry Met Sally" -- with five 
nominations each -- were the clear favorites this year among the Hollywood 
Foreign Press Assn., which announced the nominees for its annual Golden Globe 
Awards Wednesday morning in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Following close behind with four nominations each were 'Dead Poets Society," 
"Do the Right Thing" (tapped by the L.A. Film Critics as the year's best 
picture), and Disney's animated fairy tale, "The Little Mermaid." On the 
television side, NBC's "L.A. Law" walked away with eight nominations, while 
NBC's "Cheers" received four, and ABC's "thirtysomething" -- which won last 
year's Golden Globe Award for best dramatic series -- earned three. 
</P>
<P>
The most popular TV miniseries or made for TV movies were "Lonesome Dove," with 
four nominations, and "Roe vs. Wade," with three. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe Awards, which will be handed out Jan. 20, often provide a good 
indicator of what direction the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
will take in awarding its coveted Oscars each year. In the past 11 years, eight 
Golden Globe winners in the dramatic film category -- including last year's 
winner, "Rain Man" -- went on to win Academy Awards for best picture. 
</P>
<P>
The 84 Hollywood-based foreign reporters who voted did shut out a handful of 
films considered possible Oscar candidates, including two Holocaust-themed 
films, "Triumph of the Spirit" and "Enemies, a Love Story," whose director Paul 
Mazursky was named the year's best director last week by the New York Film 
Critics Cirle; Kenneth Branagh's widely acclaimed "Henry V," and Phil Alden 
Robinson's baseball fantasy, "Field of Dreams." The latter omission is not 
surprising because, as a rule, baseball films are rarely popular overseas -- 
"Field of Dreams" was no exception at the foreign box office. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globe nominees for best dramatic picture were "Born on the Fourth of 
July," in which Tom Cruise portrays Vietnam vet Ron Kovic; Woody Allen's 
morality play, "Crimes and Misdemeanors"; "Dead Poets Society," starring Robin 
Williams as a teacher who brings his iconoclastic style to a strict boys prep 
school; "Do the Right Thing," Spike Lee's controversial look at the makings of 
an urban race riot, and "Glory," a Civil War film about the fate of an

"Born on the Fourth of July" also earned a best actor nomination for Cruise, a 
best director nomination for Oliver Stone, a best screenplay nomination for 
Stone and Kovic (on whose life the film is based), and a best original score 
nomination for John Williams. 
</P>
<P>
"Glory's" other nominees included Denzel Washington for his supporting role; 
Edward Zwick for direction; Kevin Jarre for his screenplay and James Horner for

also drew a best actress nomination for Jessica Tandy; "Shirley Valentine,"

Roses," which brought nominations for co-stars Kathleen Turner and Michael 
Douglas, and "The Little Mermaid," which earned another three nominations for 
its music. 
</P>
<P>
"My Left Foot," the New York film critics' choice as the year's best picture, 
was ignored in the best dramatic picture category. But its star, Daniel 
Day-Lewis, was nominated for best actor in a dramatic film. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to Cruise and Day-Lewis, the foreign reporters nominated Jack 
Lemmon ("Dad"); Al Pacino ("Sea of Love"), and Robin Williams ("Dead Poets 
Society") in the best actor category for dramatic pictures.

'HOUSE PARTY' TO BOW ON KNBC SCHEDULE JAN. 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KNBC-TV Channel 4 will introduce "House Party," an hourlong entertainment and 
information program, to its daily schedule Jan. 22 at 10 a.m. Steve Doocy, a 
former feature reporter for WRC-TV, the NBC-owned station in Washington, will 
host the show that will feature various speciality contributors. 
</P>
<P>
The new series will move into the KNBC-TV lineup in the wake of the 
cancellation of the half-hour daily program, "U.S.A. Today on TV." To make room 
for the one-hour "House Party," Channel 4 will move "Scrabble" to a late-night 
spot, and give new time periods to "Golden Girls" (9 a.m.), "227" (9:30 a.m.) 
and "Classic Concentration" (11 a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
"House Party" is the product of a unique development deal involving Group W, 
the NBC Stations Division, Group W Station Group and NBC Productions.

SCOPE: ATHLETIC LEAGUE DIVERTS GANG YOUTHS INTO RING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HARRIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A couple of months ago, 11-year-old Eric Davis was fighting and bullying his 
classmates at St. Lawrence Brindise Catholic School in Los Angeles. The 
fighting got so bad that school officials were on the verge of expelling the 
sixth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
Then Eric's mother, Felicia Bellows, discovered a release for her son's energy. 
After school each day, Eric, who lives in Watts, can be found punching the 
heavy bags at the Sheriff's Athletic League in Lynwood. 
</P>
<P>
"I appreciate the program so much that I pay my sister to pick Eric up from 
school and take him to Lynwood. I pick him up every evening after I get off 
work," said Bellows, a secretary with the Automobile Club of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
Several youths from Lynwood and other nearby cities lace on the gloves five 
days a week to participate in athletic league activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department started the league more than two years ago to try to 
curb street gang activity and to serve as an outlet for troubled youths or 
bored youngsters looking for something to do. 
</P>
<P>
"We wanted to show them the soft side of the badge, and they are responding," 
said Sgt. Elmer Flye, a league coordinator and one of the founders of the 
Lynwood program. Flye and five other deputies from the sheriff's Lynwood 
substation are assigned to handle the league activities. 
</P>
<P>
The Lynwood substation provides law enforcement services for the city of 
Lynwood and the unincorporated county areas of east Compton and Willowbrook, 
with a combined population of 85,000. 
</P>
<P>
"The department was interested in engaging in some character-building," Flye 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been set up in a 20,000-square-foot building that once housed a 
Montgomery Ward automotive center. Montgomery Ward closed its retail store 
nearby in March, 1987, and donated the automotive building at 3100 E. Imperial 
Highway to the city. 
</P>
<P>
The program has been financed by a combination of city and state grants, 
fund-raisers and donations. The center has received about $126,000 the last two 
years from the state Office of Criminal Justice Planning and nearly $50,000 
from the city. 
</P>
<P>
As Flye spoke, two youths sparred in a $20,000 boxing ring donated by an El 
Monte businessman who wished to remain anonymous. Ray Vasquez, 17, and Juan 
Cabrera, 16, belonged to rival Lynwood gangs but have become good friends since 
participating in the boxing program, said boxing coordinator Mike Ramirez. 
"These two guys are good examples of people learning to get along," Ramirez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Vasquez said he still is a member of his gang but enjoys coming to the gym to 
spar. Cabrera said he no longer participates in gang activities. 
</P>
<P>
"This is like college. I'm learning things and it keeps me off the streets, 
keeps me from getting shot. I don't drink or smoke. I'm in shape," said 
Cabrera, who weighs 106 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
As Vasquez and Cabrera feinted and jabbed, several other youths, some as young 
as 8, hammered punching bags. An aerobics class was in progress nearby. About 
45 women were dancing, panting and sweating to the rhythm of "Let's Go Crazy" 
by rock star Prince. 
</P>
<P>
Aerobics teacher Evelyn Davis, like most of the people who help the sheriff's 
deputies run the center, is a volunteer. She conducts the class three nights a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
"I enjoy it. I would be doing aerobics (at home), but this way I have a lot of 
company," said the energetic Davis, 28, who works with welfare families for the 
Department of Public Social Services. Her 7-month-old daughter, Dwanna, plays 
with her toys off to the side while her mother leads the class. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a family affair," said Deputy Fred Shaw, pointing to several parents 
waiting in an adjoining room while their children took part in a karate class. 
"We teach the kids discipline. We also stress education," added Scott Wiseman, 
the karate teacher. 
</P>
<P>
The youths must maintain a C average in their school grades to participate in 
the karate exercises, and they must bring their report cards to Wiseman, he 
said. "We have youths who were once D students now on the honor roll," said 
Wiseman, the holder of a black belt. 
</P>
<P>
Flye said it is difficult to measure the impact that the center has had on the 
more than 50 youth gangs in the area served by the Lynwood substation. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, "I think we have accomplished a great deal. We have had some 
subtle influences. "We don't hear reports of kids who come here continuing to 
get into trouble. They also bring other troubled kids to the center who we 
help."

EXERCISE THAT'S OUT OF THIS WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We just can't seem to escape exercise no matter how far we go. 
</P>
<P>
Even if we travel to Mars, where U.S. scientists are planning a joint trip with 
the Soviets. Or to the moon, where scientists dream of orbiting space platforms 
and mining communities. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, if the Lunar-Mars initiative -- what these dreams are officially called -- 
becomes reality, so will the problems of microgravity, a condition that has 
one-sixth the gravity of Earth. The last time a U.S. astronaut spent prolonged 
time in space travel, in the Skylab series in the '70s, he returned a little 
bit shorter because of bone loss in the heel bone. A fair amount of 
cardiovascular and muscle deterioration also occurred. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists learned from Skylab, which orbited the earth for 84 days, and also 
from a one-year Soviet space mission, that astronauts have physical problems 
adjusting to microgravity and then readjusting to earth. 
</P>
<P>
"It took about two or three weeks for our astronauts to physically come back to 
normal after Skylab, and reports are that it took a month or two for the 
Russians . . . and we don't know if the Russians regained their bone loss or 
not," said Dr. Bernard Harris of the Johnson Space Center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
Because bone is a living tissue, it will respond to the stress that is placed 
on it. In space there is little stress, so the bone actually decreases in size 
to make the skeleton lighter. 
</P>
<P>
The problem, according to some researchers, is that after two or three years in 
space a human may not regain the same level of bone and bone density, which in 
turn could result in a loss of strength. 
</P>
<P>
The prescription to this dilemma -- scientists believe -- is exercise. 
</P>
<P>
That's why Space Station Freedom, scheduled to launch in 1996, will include an 
exercise facility in the spaceship. 
</P>
<P>
The facility will include a treadmill, a bike rower used for cycling and 
rowing, and a weightlfiting machine called a tork. The tork has an electric 
motor to provide resistance, and different attachments to perform bicep curls, 
tricep extensions and leg and military presses. 
</P>
<P>
Exercise in space results in other problems. Scientists are trying to make the 
exercise period short enough so that it does not impact the space mission. 
</P>
<P>
"We have ongoing studies in simulated microgravity to see if we can cram an 
entire daily activity that a person would do, including the exercise, into a 
two-hour period, which would include the treadmill and bike rower, etc," Harris 
said. 
</P>
<P>
To determine force, Harris doubles a person's body weight and then multiplies 
that figure by the number of steps the person takes during a day. A program is 
then prescribed on the treadmill, adjusting speed, grade and steps to equal the 
required amount of force expenditure. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the subject in bed and get him up for any period of time you are going 
to cram this into," Harris said. "Actually, some health spas are taking this 
concept and coming up with 30 minute workouts. The body experiences the total 
load and force that you would have if you worked out for two hours at a lower 
intensity." 
</P>
<P>
Exercise in space will have a different twist and produce different results. In 
running, for example, elastic cords, which may be the business of the future, 
will be used to keep a runner on the ground. Because there is little gravity, 
there will be no force generated from the weight of the runner's foot hitting 
the ground. The major force expended will be from the resistance of the runner 
moving against the elastic cords. 
</P>
<P>
In weightlifting, force must be produced because nothing weighs anything in 
space. 
</P>
<P>
"So if you lift five pounds down here with your biceps, you are lifting against 
gravity and are also holding your arm up against gravity," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"If you take the same body and put it into microgravity, it's not lifting 
anything but pulling against the weight itself. So the characteristics of 
weightlifting will be different." 
</P>
<P>
The alternative to trying to exercise in microgravity is to produce artificial 
gravity in space. At the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, Calif., 
researchers are studying the creation of artificial gravity through 
centrifugation -- rotating the spacecraft, which is connecting to a rotating 
device, by a long chain. One of the Gemini missions experimented with the 
concept and it was deemed it feasible. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rob Whalen, a research scientist at Ames, says scientists are also studying 
the relationship between exercising at a higher gravity level, even higher than 
the 1G on earth, for a shorter period of time. They also are studying the use 
of simulating the earth's gravity for intermittent exposure to astronauts in 
space travel. 
</P>
<P>
"Right now in our technology we don't have the means to produce artificial 
gravity effectively, but we know that is probably the answer to space travel 
and life in space," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
In that case, exercise, as well as sports, could be performed in space in much 
the same as on earth. But it may not be as much fun. 
</P>
<P>
"I was asked a couple of years ago if we could play football on the moon, " 
Harris said. "I said yes, but since the moon's gravity is one sixth that of the 
earth's, we would have to have a field about six times as large, because you 
could throw the ball farther. Each step you take would be a longer one. There 
are things unique to the moon that would make sports very interesting." 
</P>
<P>
Harris also thinks the environment of space will create its own sports, whether 
a variance of sports as we know them on or new sports. 
</P>
<P>
"Jumping may be a possibility," he said, laughing.

TACKLE AND BAIT ALREADY ARE POURING OUT OF THE LABS. THE FISH THEMSELVES ARE 
NOT FAR BEHIND.; 
</P>
<P>
FISHERMEN ARE TRYING TO BAIT MOTHER NATURE; 
</P>
<P>
FISHING TIPS WILL NO LONGER COME FROM THE BACKWOODS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS / TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Life and fishing were simpler when cane poles were the craze and the only 
artificial products were traditional lures and flies. 
</P>
<P>
Flies came wet or dry, and that was enough to keep anglers happy. Nobody longed 
for a graphite rod or an electric reel. Where would you plug it in? 
</P>
<P>
Then tackle makers convinced anglers that they really needed high tech to bag 
those beauties, so fishing became big business. Fully equipped with neoprene 
waders, Polaroid glasses, electronic fish finders and more little gizmos than 
they could fit into alloy tackle boxes, the fishermen went forth with only one 
little problem: getting the fish to bite. But that will always be a problem. 
</P>
<P>
Or will it? 
</P>
<P>
Just when it seems fishing has gone about as far as it can go, here come people 
saying that man is just around the bend from achieving the angler's ultimate 
dream: invisible line and irresistible bait. A fish will never know what he's 
swimming into. 
</P>
<P>
Those who have always said that fishing is a science never imagined the 
developments that will sweep the sport into the '90s. The fishing secrets of 
the 21st Century will not be found listening to crusty and crafty country folk 
gathered around wood stoves in general stores. The new know-how will come from 
scientists in spotless laboratories. 
</P>
<P>
Tackle and bait already are pouring out of the labs. The fish themselves are 
not far behind. 
</P>
<P>
Dave Ellison, an executive of the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society (BASS) that 
promotes the richest series of tournaments across the country, said the 
technology has come a long way from the "flasher" units that blinked a red 
light when a fish broke the beam between a boat and the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
Those were followed by liquid crystal recorders (LCRs) that showed silhouettes 
of fish on a graph or screen as the boat passed over, but the boat first had to 
find the right place. They've just about worked that out. 
</P>
<P>
"One of the biggest things that's going to be coming out is more for saltwater 
or large bodies of fresh water," Ellison said. "It's a device that will bounce 
off a satellite and allow you to find any position you want to. If you have a 
secret hole on a lake or an ocean, you get your measurements programmed in and 
they tell you how to get back there (the next time)." 
</P>
<P>
Loran-C units can do that, too, but they rely on land references for location 
and are limited to about 400 miles offshore and only a couple of hundred miles 
south of the border, providing little help to serious Baja anglers. A satellite 
unit will work anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the market are two satellite-linked devices that will help to find 
fish. Satellites can't see fish, but they can distinguish water temperature -- 
a solid clue to which species of fish should be there. Cold water is usually 
green and murky, holding salmon and mako sharks. Warmer water, where big game 
fish hang out, tends to be blue and clear. 
</P>
<P>
The only shortcoming, Ellison said, is that "it can't make 'em bite. We've 
spent millions and millions on fooling fish but nobody's ever found a way yet 
to make 'em bite." 
</P>
<P>
Until now, perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
Berkley, Inc., of Spirit Lake, Iowa, all but revolutionized trout fishing when 
its Power Bait hit the market in 1988, but that was only the beginning. In '89, 
the company came out with Power Worms and Power Grubs, and spokesman Mike Fine 
said the next product will be "a step beyond Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
It may not be nice to fool with her, but if it works, fishermen will try to 
restrain their principles. 
</P>
<P>
Berkley has its own research and development lab, headed by Keith Jones, the 
chief of fish biology who developed Power Bait. If one wishes to understand 
fish, he must live with fish. 
</P>
<P>
"Keith is in the lab with the fish every day," Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
Lately, Jones has been trying to determine what kind of smells attract fish -- 
sort or how Liz Taylor tested her latest perfume. 
</P>
<P>
"We have been able to isolate a few ingredients that really turn the fish on," 
Fine said. 
</P>
<P>
The secret ingredients will be put into bait or plastic worms and grubs. Men, 
fish -- to Liz and Berkley it's all the same deal. 
</P>
<P>
The company also makes rods and fishing line. 
</P>
<P>
"Our dream is to make a line as thin and as strong as spider web, which for a 
single strand of material is the strongest substance known to man," Fine said. 
"We are about two-thirds of the way there. Maybe we need bigger spiders or 
something. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be some more breakthroughs. We're eliminating some of the 
barriers, We're working on things that are very exciting. Obviously, I can't go 
into much detail." 
</P>
<P>
Obviously. Fishermen will always have secrets. 
</P>
<P>
But now that science is about to persuade the fish to bite, all that remains is 
to catch bigger fish -- and you just know somebody is working on that. 
</P>
<P>
The California Fish and Game Commission has just dropped the statewide daily 
trout limit from 10 to five, promising larger fish instead. The Department of 
Fish and Game hopes to achieve that by using a higher quality of feed and 
perhaps even steroids in the hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
Years ago, the DFG experimented with developing hybrids, including "tiger 
trout" -- a cross from a male brook to a female brown that produced a larger, 
aggressive trout but one that failed to excite anglers. 
</P>
<P>
"They didn't do very well in California," said Bob Rawstron, chief of Inland 
Fisheries for the DFG. "They weren't received well by the public, either. It 
was a fad that passed." 
</P>
<P>
But now they're working on a plan that the fish won't want to hear about. 
</P>
<P>
Rawstron said: "We've got experiments going on with sterile fish. One of the 
problems with any fish is that during the period when they are spawning they're 
not growing. Most of the food they're getting is going into the development of 
eggs. And the male doesn't eat very much during these periods. He's more 
interested in (mating)." 
</P>
<P>
The technique for sterilizing fish was developed by British scientists on the 
Isle of Man. Rawstron's people call the California subjects London Ladies. 
</P>
<P>
Rawstron said that Texas fish biologists are trying to develop a "super bass." 
He'll await results before deciding if California is ready for that. 
</P>
<P>
Flyfishermen no doubt will shun all of these technological advances. Despite 
the development of graphite rods and synthetic lines, their whole ethic is 
still based on 19th-Century traditions that will endure. They won't mind if 
they continue to be regarded as a bit odd by other types of anglers. 
</P>
<P>
But super bait for super fish should encourage more people to become involved. 
It could even relieve the stress of executive commuters trapped in the 
increased gridlock forecast for the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Marriott, who has fly fishing stores in Fullerton, Burbank and Irvine, 
said: "The ultimate thing is going to be ultralight, multi-piece tackle you can 
put in your pocket -- line and an 8- or 10-piece rod with a small reel." 
</P>
<P>
Stuck on the freeway, an angler will be able to pop his tackle out of the glove 
compartment, roll down the window and troll the Los Angeles River, bumper to 
bumper -- certainly a better way to pass the time. Even in the 21st Century, 
that will still be what fishing is all about.

<P>
Technology has been applied in sports most often to benefit athletes. 
</P>
<P>
And why not? Machines are increasingly responsible for the gains made in the 
last decade by athletes, who now have access to computerized weight-training 
devices and wind tunnels in which to ride their bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
But machines also are used to govern and judge sport. Some believe this area 
will yield the greatest sports breakthroughs of the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
Here, then, is a brief look at technology as it is applied in some sports, and 
projections for the future for others. 
</P>
<P>
Instant Replay, or: Just a Second . . . Hang On . . . Let's See That From 
Another Angle 
</P>
<P>
Who would have guessed that one of the most significant innovations in 
professional football would entail a gang of men clustering around a television 
set, intently watching something they had already seen. 
</P>
<P>
Instant replay has been an experiment in the NFL since it was approved in 1986. 
It has survived tenuously on a year-to-year basis since then. 
</P>
<P>
Its institution was born out of the agonizingly close calls, foot-on-the-line 
touchdowns and flat-out missed infractions that persuaded league owners to 
approve the use of video replays to review controversial or close calls by 
officials on the field. 
</P>
<P>
As it is used, a replay official -- the league has 16 -- calls for a play to be 
reviewed. Using a television feed, officials review the play and either confirm 
or reverse the on-field official's call. 
</P>
<P>
The use of the replay was approved on the strength of two of its strongest 
advocates -- Commissioner Pete Rozelle and Dallas Cowboy General Manager Tex 
Schramm. Schramm's advocacy was so great that he has been called the godfather 
of replay. Rozelle was a staunch supporter, guiding the decision through its 
rocky early stages. 
</P>
<P>
Now both men are out of the NFL, and the future of instant replay is in doubt. 
Put another way, the NFL may have to look at the situation again. 
</P>
<P>
Replays have proved to be costly and -- most irritating -- time consuming. And 
the replay has many times provided controversy of its own. 
</P>
<P>
It appears clear that the use of instant replay for this season was about to go 
the way of other well-meant innovations. With Rozelle out, and new Commissioner 
Paul Tagliabue lukewarm on the concept, the NFL may choose not to play it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
But if the NFL is losing interest in instant replay, at least two other groups 
are investigating it. The National Hockey League has decided to experiment with 
instant replay during the next exhibition season. If, after the tryout, the 
league goes ahead with the plan, instant replays likely will be instituted for 
the playoffs of the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
The replay will be used only to determine if the puck crossed the goal line, 
often a difficult assessment to make in such a fast-moving sport. Hockey is 
plugging along as it always has, with an official stationed in a glass booth 
behind the net. The official watches the play and, if he determines a goal has 
been scored, activates a red flashing light. 
</P>
<P>
The NHL uses video replays to determine who scored a goal or assisted. 
</P>
<P>
For the NHL experiment, teams will not be able to request replays. That 
decision will be made only by the referee. Once requested, the replay will be 
made by a supervisor of officials, who will watch the replay on a monitor from 
the press box. Already league officials have expressed a concern about the time 
it takes to make decisions. 
</P>
<P>
"Our decision-making certainly has to be under five minutes," said General 
Manager Bob Pulford of the Chicago Blackhawks "It should be done in three, four 
minutes tops. We don't want any major holdups." 
</P>
<P>
College football has flirted with the idea of using replays but has 
resisted.Again, time and cost are high considerations. Also, the college game 
is fraught with tradition and use of replays may be viewed as a crass 
interloper. 
</P>
<P>
The Cyclops, or: Beeeep. Excuse Me, Mr. McEnroe, Your Serve Was Long 
</P>
<P>
Tennis has experimented with mechanical alternatives to linesmen. No one is 
100% happy with the electronic line-calling system, which still has bugs. But 
some players have longed to see linesmen absent from matches. 
</P>
<P>
One such system is called Accu-Call. First used in competition in January of 
1988, the system was developed after 10 years of research and at a cost of $2.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
Accu-Call uses an electronically charged line that determines in and out balls 
that land within two feet of the line. Beyond two feet, the umpire makes the 
call. 
</P>
<P>
The system uses a ball with electronic circuitry woven into its fabric. The 
manufacturer claims lines can be called to within one-thousandth of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the British system, Cyclops. Used in all Grand Slam tournaments, 
the system uses two rays of light covering a band 20 inches wide. If the ball 
breaks the light ray outside the service line, it is ruled out and an 
electronic peep is sounded. 
</P>
<P>
Cyclops is used only to call service lines and only in singles. The light beam 
can't distinguish between a ball, foot or racket breaking the beam. So, it 
can't be used to call all lines. 
</P>
<P>
And, one wonders who John McEnroe is going to yell at if there are no 
officials? And who would pay to watch? 
</P>
<P>
Electronic Scoring in Fencing, or: Touch Me There And You've Had It 
</P>
<P>
Fencing may have been the first sport to gear up electrically. Equipment 
manufacturers at the turn of the century began to offer battery-operated foils 
and sabers for training to alert the novice with a beep when a touch was 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
The system was first used in the Olympic Games in 1936, in men's epee. By 1956, 
it had been allowed in the men's and women's foil. 
</P>
<P>
Not surprisingly in such a formal, traditional sport, there was an outcry 
against these devices. 
</P>
<P>
"There were some people who said, 'That's it! I'll never fence again,' " said 
Dan DeChaine, chairman of the U.S. Fencing Assn.'s technical commission and 
member of the international federation's commission for electronic scoring, 
installations and materials. 
</P>
<P>
DeChaine said there were some protests because the implements were heavy and 
unwieldy. Officials prevailed because of problems caused by subjective judging. 
</P>
<P>
"In order to salvage the sport, we went to this," he said. "There was nothing 
blatant, but an awful lot of arguing. Politics were a big part of it." 
</P>
<P>
Electronic scoring in fencing is fairly simple. There is a switch on the end of 
the weapon, which, if pressed hard enough, registers a touch. The switch is 
fixed with a calibrated spring and plugged into a scoring machine that records 
touches. Most touches wins. 
</P>
<P>
"The machine has no politics," DeChaine said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there is a human element. A president of the jury is in charge of the 
bout. Like a referee in boxing, he starts and stops the bout and watches for 
certain things. For example, if a fencer is attempting to touch an opponent and 
misses and hits the floor, the official ensures that no touch is scored even 
though one may register electronically. 
</P>
<P>
DeChaine says the system has worked "marvelously well," but there are ways to 
beat it. 
</P>
<P>
The sport experimented with a wireless scoring system for a time, but soon 
found people in the stands with little black boxes, busily punching in their 
own scores. The rules now say that the fencer must be connected to a scoring 
box in a completely closed system. 
</P>
<P>
Fencing suffered its darkest moment at the 1976 Olympics when a Soviet 
pentathlete was caught with a switch built into the grip of his epee. He needed 
only to press his finger on the handle to score a touch. 
</P>
<P>
"It was embarrassing to all of us in the sport," DeChaine said. "We were 
outraged that someone, a world champion, would do something like that. I heard 
he wound up driving a taxi in Kiev." 
</P>
<P>
Electronic, Computerized Judging In Boxing, or: Switched On Box 
</P>
<P>
Next to gymnastics and diving, what sport has had more judging controversies 
than boxing? Some boxing decisions make one wonder if the judges saw the same 
bout as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
The Seoul Olympics featured what was perhaps the most wild and unpredictable 
competition in the history of boxing. Some purely political decisions were made 
and most observers agreed that boxing -- in an ironic metaphor -- had given 
itself a black eye. 
</P>
<P>
Officials in the sport were told that politics had to be taken out of judging. 
Thus, for the first time, an electronic scoring system was used in this year's 
World Championships. 
</P>
<P>
Judges sat before a computer keyboard and registered each scoring blow when it 
happened. Information was transferred to a video screen, showing the scoring 
blow and which judge had registered it. For a blow to count, three of five 
judges had to register it. 
</P>
<P>
The system is more precise, linking a point directly with the blow, and also 
holds judges more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
With a videotaped history of each bout, protests are more easily handled. And 
monitors show the judges scoring at the boxing jury's table, so there is 
constant review of the scoring status of each bout. 
</P>
<P>
According to Jim Fox, executive director of the U.S. Amateur Boxing Federation, 
the system was implemented with some difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
"It is a major issue, getting the coaches and federations to realize that this 
is the way they have to go," he said. "The issue is that by moving in these 
directions, we may bring rhyme and reason to the sport where the general public 
can understand what's going on. Seoul was a major factor in the scoring 
machine." 
</P>
<P>
Track and Field, the NBA and everybody else, or: Plug Me In, Coach 
</P>
<P>
Jim Terrill was the meet director for the three years of the International 
Track Assn. This professional track circuit was around from 1973 to 1976 and 
was responsible for not only some of the most blatantly gaudy gimmicks, but 
also technological innovations ahead of their time. 
</P>
<P>
The ITA would do nearly anything in the name of promotion. 
</P>
<P>
With that in mind, Terrill brought in pacing lights, a system of lights 
designed for training. The ITA rightly guessed they would made great theater. 
</P>
<P>
A string of large light bulbs, encased in plastic, was placed around the inside 
of the track. Time was programmed into the device and lights "ran" at that 
pace. 
</P>
<P>
The lights were synchronized with the electronic starting device and would 
blink in succession around the track, operating as a kind of "rabbit." The 
concept, was either "extremely effective or devastatingly bad," Terrill said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's extremely exciting for the crowd, if the runners are equal to the 
lights," he said. "We had some real dog races, then, however. We would set the 
lights at a certain pace and the lights would actually lap the athletes. Then I 
would be accused of turning off the lights, which, of course, I did." 
</P>
<P>
Even renegade outfits have pride. 
</P>
<P>
It may be that track and field utilizes more equipment than most sports. 
Devices start races, record the finish, time and measure. 
</P>
<P>
A machine, the Accutrack, phased out a fond relic of the sport: A pack of men 
in dark suits and hats, bunched together, peering at stopwatches. 
</P>
<P>
Now hand timers are used as backups. The starter's gun is wired to the timing 
system and automatically starts the race "clock." The order of finish is 
determined by a photograph. 
</P>
<P>
Field events are effected, too. Officials no longer rush out after the javelin 
lands, pulling a 300-foot tape measure. Now throws and horizontal jumps are 
measured by a surveyor's transit or triangulation. 
</P>
<P>
In triangulation, a scorer sights where the implement was released and where it 
landed. Using his position as the third leg of a triangle, the scorer, or his 
computer, calculates the distance the discus, for example, has traveled. 
</P>
<P>
These systems in no way eliminate the human element -- or cheating, for that 
matter. But within their limits they are precise. 
</P>
<P>
One can foresee using a pressure pad embedded in a long jump or triple jump 
take-off board to call fouls. Or a beam of light instead of a crossbar in the 
high jump or pole vault. 
</P>
<P>
Terrill believes that we could transfer technology from one sport to another. 
The NFL could use a photo-finish device to detect whether the football breaks 
the plane of the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
Or perhaps offensive players could wear sensors, much like clothes tags in 
department stores, that would trigger an alarm once they enter the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
In the NBA, a sensor could be implanted at the three-point line to determine if 
a shooter was on the line, behind it or over it. The trick would be to develop 
a sensor that would not also record everyone else on the floor who was stepping 
on the line at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
Why couldn't baseball use laser technology to project a batter's box and strike 
zone? 
</P>
<P>
Dog racing's use of technology has put rabbits on the bread (carrot?) line. 
Live rabbits once lured greyhounds around the track, but now there is a 
mechanical rabbit, or lure, that emits an electronic noise. This can best be 
described as a squeak. 
</P>
<P>
Normally this system works quite well. But human control can breed human error. 
There have been cases of dogs overtaking the lure and attacking the squeaking 
metal rabbit. When this happens it is called a mechanical failure and all money 
is refunded. 
</P>
<P>
Auto racing has been on the replay bandwagon. In the 1981 Indianapolis 500, 
video replays showed that Bobby Unser passed slower cars during a caution 
period. Officials penalized Unser a lap, making Mario Andretti the winner. The 
call was later reversed, but the replay can of worms had been opened. Replays 
are still used in auto racing to review protests. 
</P>
<P>
Yachting is talking about starting races with a video camera positioned at the 
starting line with an imaginary line drawn through the screen and real time 
projected on image as a way of measuring who may have false-started and when. 
Since most sailboat races start with one or two boats over the line, this may 
catch many cheaters. 
</P>
<P>
But don't forget to factor in human nature. For every technological 
breakthrough that may make sports and games more nearly fair, there is sure to 
be someone with a device designed to thwart it. 
</P>
<P>
Said Andy Kostanecki, chairman of the U.S. Olympic Committee's panel on Sports 
Equipment and Technology, "One thing you can always say is the technology is 
always ahead of the politics. Then politics catches up."

"Cheers" made its way to the No. 1 slot for front-running NBC last week, while 
CBS finished No. 2 for the second week in a row, according to figures released 
Wednesday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. It's the second time this season "Cheers" has 
risen to the top, a position normally taken by ABC's "Roseanne" and NBC's "The 
Cosby Show." In winning the week, NBC's prime-time programs averaged an 
audience of 11.8 million households, compared to 10.8 million for CBS and 10.4 
million for ABC. The full list of ratings is on F12. 
</P>
<P>
* "I Love Lucy Christmas," a nostalgic episode of the classic CBS series that 
had not been shown in 33 years, was the week's sixth-highest-rated program.

Box office -- "Family Business" and "Look Who's Talking" finished ninth and 
10th, respectively, at the nation's movie box offices over the Christmas 
weekend. Each film grossed about $1.5 million. Some editions of Wednesday's 
Calendar reported that the No. 9 and 10 films were "We're No Angels" and "The 
Wizard." Also, the correct total gross for eighth-ranked "Blaze" was $1.6

HE'S SOMETHING TO SHOUT ABOUT;

<P>
ROSE BOWL: MICHIGAN RUNNING BACK LEROY HOARD HAS FOUND A METHOD TO THE MADNESS 
AS A SUBJECT OF COACH BO SCHEMBECHLER'S TIRADES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAL FLORENCE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This will be the last week that Bo Schembechler ever yells at Leroy Hoard. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler, as we know, is retiring as Michigan's coach after the Rose Bowl 
game against USC on Monday. Hoard, a junior, stays on -- a player molded and 
scolded by Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
Bo's yelling, which he has done a lot in his 27 years as a head coach, hasn't 
always been music to Hoard's ears, but he has learned to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard, a 220-pound fullback-tailback, was the most valuable player in last 
January's Rose Bowl, a 22-14 Wolverine victory over USC. 
</P>
<P>
He broke open the game in the fourth quarter with a 61-yard run that positioned 
Michigan for its clinching touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard gained 142 yards, averaging 7.5 a carry, and scored two touchdowns in 
that game, shredding a defense that had not allowed another running back to 
gain more than 100 yards during the season. 
</P>
<P>
With Tony Boles inactive because of knee surgery, Hoard will play tailback 
exclusively against USC instead of alternating at fullback and tailback. Hoard 
rushed for 724 yards, averaging almost five yards a carry, and six touchdowns 
during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
He is a power back with speed and was so impressive in the last Rose Bowl game 
that Ram Coach John Robinson told Schembechler, a close friend, that Hoard had 
the status of a No.1 draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard is a humble athlete who wasn't even sure he could play college football, 
let alone in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a friendly, outgoing sort who gets into Bo's doghouse occasionally 
by cutting a class. 
</P>
<P>
"Leroy hasn't given me any trouble; I've given Leroy trouble," Schembechler 
said. "He and I have had some disagreements, and I'm the head coach." 
</P>
<P>
That's vintage Bo. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler made it clear, though, that Hoard has never done anything 
seriously wrong at Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
Hoard was a high school star in New Orleans, and he recalled what friends and 
other coaches told him about the Michigan coach while he was being recruited. 
</P>
<P>
"They said he's a mean guy, the toughest coach there is," Hoard said. "But he 
had a sweet voice. Then, when I got to Michigan, I was one of the first guys he 
yelled at, and it has been going on for four years." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard doesn't seem bothered by Bo's bombast. He seemingly takes it all in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
There was a time, though, when Schembechler's tirades upset him. 
</P>
<P>
"The freshmen used to scrimmage on Monday, and with Jarrod Bunch hurt, I was 
the only fullback," Hoard said. "Well, I fumbled, and the coach said, 'I'll be 
glad when Bunch gets back.' 
</P>
<P>
"When you're a freshman, things coaches say tend to get to you a lot more, 
because when you're older you realize they say things only to motivate you and 
you shouldn't take it personally." 
</P>
<P>
He says he understands Bo now. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the kind of person that if he confronts you, he lets you defend yourself 
-- for a couple of seconds. 
</P>
<P>
"You can get a couple of words in, and I've been known to sneak in more than my 
share. But when I think about it now, it's no use. Just be quiet." 
</P>
<P>
There was a time last year, though, when Schembechler listened, according to 
Hoard. 
</P>
<P>
"He told me why he did everything," Hoard said. "I said, 'You can yell at me 
all you want,' because I knew he had a reason. For a long time I thought it was 
just me. Maybe I wasn't a good player." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard learned later that Schembechler is indiscriminate in his yelling, even 
though the running back's ears burned more than most. 
</P>
<P>
In an earlier interview with the Detroit Free Press, Hoard was philosophical 
about his relationship with Schembechler. 
</P>
<P>
"Bo taught me that when you do something wrong, you have to accept the 
consequences," he said. "Regardless of how great a game it is, school and the 
other things are more important." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard can joke about his years with Schembechler now that the coach is 
retiring. 
</P>
<P>
"My mom came up for the Ohio State game and asked me why I had so many keys," 
Hoard said. "I said, 'This one is for my car and this one is for my apartment. 
This is for the mailbox and this is for Bo's doghouse.' Now I guess I'll have 
to give the key back." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Hoard was a renowned player at St. Augustine High School in New 
Orleans, he doubted his own ability and had his own priorities. 
</P>
<P>
"I left Louisiana because I wanted to get away from home, even if I didn't play 
a lick of football in college, and I didn't think I would play," he said. "I 
wanted to travel, I wanted to see snow, I wanted to go to the Rose Bowl. There 
were a lot of things I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
"Out of all the schools I looked at, this was the only school that gave me 
academics, travel and a chance to go to California. I chose Michigan and I have 
no regrets." 
</P>
<P>
He learned that Schembechler is not effusive in his praise of players. 
</P>
<P>
For example, after his outstanding performance in the Rose Bowl, Schembechler 
told him that he played a good game but made some mistakes that would be 
evaluated at a film session. 
</P>
<P>
Schembechler has been rather mellow on his last trip to the Rose Bowl and has 
praised Hoard -- to an extent. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hard to tackle and is a fine, fine runner," Schembechler said. "He gets a 
big play every game, too. But he has to play better without the ball, as a 
blocker, receiver and faker." 
</P>
<P>
Hoard agrees with that assessment. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not that I'm standing around, but there are some points where I can 
improve to make myself a better player," he said. 
</P>
<P>
If he improves as expected, then Hoard will probably be an NFL first-round 
draft choice after his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a longshot," Hoard said of an NFL career. "I didn't think I could play 
college football, but I made it this far. If my career were to end right now, 
I'd be satisfied."

3. A new 32-lane facility in Downey where the last 300-game was rolled. 
</P>
<P>
4. A place where you go to watch the Easter sunrise services. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, the answer is none of the above. A Freedom Bowl is a football game, 
all right, and a good one. It's played right down the road from the Rose Bowl, 
but it's not to be confused with the Rose, Super, Sugar or even the Gator, 
Copper or Peach bowls. It's more like the John Hancock Bowl or even the Hall of 
Fame or Liberty Bowl. Made for television. 
</P>
<P>
It's held in Anaheim, which didn't want to be left out of the bowl picture 
altogether. No self-respecting community should be without one this time of 
year. There are 22 of them sanctioned by the NCAA with some 2,000 players 
involved, but of course, the schools persist in resisting a national collegiate 
playoff. It would keep too many athletes out of the classrooms, they say. With 
a perfectly straight face. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim started putting together a bowl of its very own eight years ago for the 
most novel of reasons. A colleague, John Hall, writing in another paper, 
noticed gloomily that two of the nation's outstanding college backs, Marcus 
Allen and Herschel Walker, had no bowl to go to that year. He suggested they 
contrive one for them. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose that's as good a reason for having a bowl game as any. I mean, not 
having a Marcus Allen or a Herschel Walker on your holiday screen is a cultural 
deprivation akin to not having a Toulouse-Lautrec in the master bath. 
</P>
<P>
So they strung together the Freedom Bowl. Too late as it happens for Marcus or 
Herschel but just in time for the likes of Gaston Green, Chris Chandler, Chuck 
Long and a host of other stars who were to get a not-otherwise available 
opportunity to be showcased in a bowl game. They probably should call it the 
Statue of Liberty Bowl, a refuge for the huddled masses yearning to run free, 
the wretched refuse of football's teeming shore. 
</P>
<P>
It's practically an institution now, the grandchild of them all. They've had 
five of them, but what makes this year's renewal interesting is not the 
players, it's a coach. 
</P>
<P>
It comes as a surprise to students of the game that Don James, the University 
of Washington coach, has won more games in the Pacific 10 (or the conference's 
various other names) than any coach in history, more than the storied Howard 
Jones, more than Pop Warner, John McKay, Red Sanders or Pappy Waldorf. Shortly, 
he will have won more games, period, than any Pacific Coast coach ever. He has 
won more football games at Washington than Knute Rockne did at Notre Dame. He's 
no secret in the profession. His fellow coaches elected him president of the 
American Football Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
In another era, he'd probably be known as "the Fox," or be called Bo or Bear or 
even Pop or Hurry Up. He's not even Dr. J. Hardly anyone even calls him Mr. 
James. 
</P>
<P>
James brings a new meaning to the term low profile. James is, like his teams, 
controlled, disciplined, programmed. But not robotized. In the '78 Rose Bowl, 
James' Washington team won the game because, late in the action with the ball 
on his 24-yard line, fourth down and a bundle, his team went for it. And made 
it. 
</P>
<P>
His teams can be adventurous but seldom rash. They never panic. They lose, but 
not by much. Alabama beat him, 52-0, the fifth game he coached at Washington. 
Three years later, the Alabama victory was 20-17. 
</P>
<P>
James' record is remarkable when you consider the University of Washington is 
not your basic football factory. Coaches leave the Northwest in droves to coach 
in Texas, Florida, California. Players historically opt for the Northwest only 
if they have exhausted other options. "If SC or Notre Dame wants a kid, I don't 
get him," James concedes. Recruiting has been further complicated with the 
addition of Arizona and Arizona State to the conference. Seattle is a long way 
from the Sun Belt. The gag goes, "Washington: First in war, first in peace -- 
and last in recruiting." 
</P>
<P>
None of this bothers Coach James, who is as stable a fixture in Seattle as the 
Space Needle and who is known as Home James because of his team's penchant for 
winning on its own field. 
</P>
<P>
In the Freedom Bowl Saturday at Anaheim Stadium, James meets a Florida team 
that is, like his, a highly underrated team that lost one game by five points, 
one by three and the other two by a touchdown. All this after losing its head 
coach to a scandal. 
</P>
<P>
James' team lost to Rose Bowl-bound USC by a touchdown and to all-world 
Colorado, the nation's No. 1 team, 45-28 -- and only after running up 22 points 
in the fourth quarter. Washington lost to Arizona State by two points and to 
Arizona by three. 
</P>
<P>
You may have a little trouble picking out Don James Saturday. He won't be 
pulling any yard markers out of the ground and hurling them at the officials. 
He won't be slamming his hat onto the turf, screaming at any players. He won't 
pace up and down the sideline like a caged leopard. He'll be hard to tell from 
the guy who's there to pick up the towels. 
</P>
<P>
After the game, he won't keep the locker room door closed. It'll be hard to 
tell from looking at him whether he won or lost. Either way, it won't be by 
much.

ORANGE BOWL: AFTER LAST SEASON, COLORADO'S DARIAN HAGAN WANTED TO SWITCH FROM 
QUARTERBACK TO RUNNING BACK. IT'S THE BEST CHANGE THE BUFFALOES NEVER MADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

MIAMI 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The guy who finished fifth in this season's Heisman Trophy balloting wasn't 
even first on the Colorado depth chart a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
Back then, Darian Hagan couldn't read a defense if you spotted him the first 
three letters of z-o-n-e. He considered plays sent from the sideline to be mere 
suggestions, not commands. He performed so poorly in the Buffaloes' last bowl 
game that even his mother wanted to ground him for a week. Too much style, too 
little substance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
So Hagan, whose letter jacket remained C-less after the 1988 season, gave up. 
He pleaded to be switched from quarterback to running back. And secretly, he 
might not have been the only Colorado player hoping the move would be approved. 
After all, Hagan's botched appearance in the 1988 Freedom Bowl (his only pass 
was intercepted, resulting in a game-winning field goal for BYU) wasn't exactly 
the prelude to greatness his coaches and teammates had in mind when he arrived 
from Locke High School. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew he was a great guy when he was a freshman," said junior linebacker 
Kanavis McGhee, a Lombardi Trophy finalist. "But I figured he was a running 
back playing quarterback. Coming into this season, everyone still had their 
doubts if he would be able to do it." 
</P>
<P>
Leading the list was none other than Hagan himself. 
</P>
<P>
Colorado quarterback coach Gary Barnett listened politely as Hagan detailed the 
many reasons why a change of positions would do the team good, to say nothing 
of Hagan's own well-being. First of all, there was this business of deciphering 
pass coverages: Hagan couldn't do it. He'd rather take a stab at reading 
Dostoevsky than try to understand the subtleties of a rotating zone. 
</P>
<P>
Hagan also explained that truth be known, he was a runner first, a passer 
second. Oh sure, he loved throwing the bomb, but it was his travel by land that 
earned him two City rushing titles, 4,338 career yards and 44 touchdowns while 
at Locke. 
</P>
<P>
And hey, who was kidding whom? As long as quarterback Sal Aunese was on the 
Colorado roster, Hagan would be an understudy. So why not do everyone a favor 
and readjust the job descriptions in the backfield? 
</P>
<P>
Barnett said he would consider the request, which he did . . . for about a 
millisecond. Hagan wasn't going anywhere, except back to the drawing board. And 
anyway, the Buffaloes needed another running back like they needed another 
visit from the Boulder Police Dept. Eric Bieniemy, a Heisman hopeful, was 
available at tailback, as was J.J. Flannigan. 
</P>
<P>
So like it or not, Hagan was going to be a quarterback. Of course, the 1989 
season was out of the question -- Aunese was returning for his senior year -- 
but if all went well, 1990 would mark the beginning of his reign. 
</P>
<P>
Then came the telephone call last spring. It was Barnett. Aunese had inoperable 
stomach cancer. 
</P>
<P>
"Somebody's got to step up," Hagan announced, "and it's going to be me." 
</P>
<P>
There are better ways to inherit a job but none more painful. Six months after 
that phone call, Aunese was dead. Ask anyone connected with the Colorado 
football program why Hagan became a finalist at this year's Heisman ceremony, 
and the answer is always the same: Aunese. 
</P>
<P>
"Sal was kind of like Darian's mentor," said wide receiver Jeff Campbell. "He 
took care of what Darian needed, told him what he needed to improve on. I 
believe Darian even talked to him before several games." 
</P>
<P>
"(Aunese) meant a lot to him," said Wanda Webb, Hagan's mother. "Darian told me 
he gave him a lot of confidence in himself. When Darian felt that he couldn't 
do something, Sal would talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
But inspiration can go only so far. At some point, emotion and talent collided, 
setting off this chain reaction of 11 consecutive Colorado victories, an Orange 
Bowl appointment with Notre Dame -- and countless Hagan triumphs. No wonder the 
Colorado quarterback found himself at a Heisman photo session a few weeks ago, 
surrounded by also-rans Tony Rice of Notre Dame, Major Harris of West Virginia, 
Dee Dowis of Air Force, Mike Mayweather of Army, Blair Thomas of Penn State and 
Anthony Thompson of Indiana -- distinguished company for someone who was 
supposed to spend this season cooling his cleats on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"Here's a guy who was a freshman last year, made his entry into the Freedom 
Bowl and didn't do so well," McGhee said. "This season, he stepped into a great 
man's shoes and did the job and did it well and was a finalist in the Heisman. 
Now you tell me that isn't an extraordinary person who can do something like 
that. 
</P>
<P>
"And he's only a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
Said Flannigan, who was no less touched by Aunese's death: "Sal taught him a 
lot, especially from the time Sal had cancer. But some things Darian had on his 
own. 
</P>
<P>
"I call him Mr. Magic. Any time he steps on the field, something is going to 
happen. Darian is so elusive." 
</P>
<P>
In Colorado's season opener against Texas, Hagan gained 75 yards on his first 
carry. He finished the game with 211 yards. Colorado State was victimized for 
103 yards and a touchdown by Hagan. Against Missouri, he gained 106 yards and 
rushed for three touchdowns. Against Oklahoma, he had 107 yards and a score. 
The next week against Nebraska, he gained 86 yards and scored once. 
</P>
<P>
You get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you hold onto your blocks longer because if Darian gets that one 
step, he's gone," tackle Bill Coleman said. "The next time we see him, we're 
all in the end zone jumping up and down with our bellies hanging out." 
</P>
<P>
By the time the regular season was complete, Hagan had become the first player 
in Big Eight history, all 83 years of it, to both rush and pass for 1,000 
yards. Only six players in NCAA history have managed double 1,000s. He 
accounted for 43% of Colorado's first downs this season. As for crunch time, 
Hagan led the Buffaloes to scores nine times in nine tries during two-minute 
drills. 
</P>
<P>
So, take that Freedom Bowl memory . . . 
</P>
<P>
"I believed I could play pretty well," Hagan said. "I had two goals, really: 
Lose the weight and make nonbelievers into believers. I think I've done a 
pretty good job so far." 
</P>
<P>
Hagan dropped 13 pounds -- he now weighs about 185 -- but more important, he 
also shed the considerable weight of self-doubt. Pass coverages no longer 
caused panic. The loss to BYU no longer haunted him. 
</P>
<P>
And all it took was that game against Texas and the advice of Aunese, who had 
counseled Hagan during spring and fall practice. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for something to give me a confidence-builder," Hagan said, "to 
get all the negative thoughts out of my mind. I mean, I was even thinking I 
couldn't be a quarterback. The media, the magazines I was reading, they were 
saying that I was the weak link, that if I didn't perform well, our dreams 
would just be washed away." 
</P>
<P>
At last look, it didn't appear that Colorado's hopes of a national championship 
were taking on much water. Notre Dame remains a formidable opponent but not 
unbeatable. Miami proved that. 
</P>
<P>
And as you might expect, Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz was doing his part to 
elevate Hagan to legend status. 
</P>
<P>
"Quicker than Tony Rice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
True. 
</P>
<P>
"He's had an unbelievable year," Holtz added. 
</P>
<P>
A fair statement. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to say his peripheral vision is the most impressive thing I've 
seen on film, ever," he said. "If you tested him, you would probably find that 
his peripheral vision would be in the top 1%." 
</P>
<P>
OK, that's enough, Lou. 
</P>
<P>
Notre Dame thought about recruiting Hagan but didn't. "He's an outstanding 
quarterback, and let's leave it at that," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
Oklahoma and then-coach Barry Switzer labeled Hagan an academic risk after his 
first set of college entrance scores were too low. Hagan took the exam again 
and passed. That done, he chose Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
"I was looking for a family and friends, not a tradition," he wrote on his 
freshman information questionnaire. "I loved CU." 
</P>
<P>
A perfect romance, it hasn't been. There have been frustration and heartache, 
joy mixed with a sense of personal loss. Yet, Hagan has managed to do what he 
said he would. 
</P>
<P>
And consider this: 52 Heisman voters considered him the best player in the 
country. A year ago, there weren't 52 Colorado football followers who would 
have called him the best player on the Buffaloes' second team. 
</P>
<P>
Fame beckons, though it certainly didn't seem it would ever find Hagan. Or was 
it the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
"It's really hard to believe," Hagan said. "Never in my wildest (thoughts) did 
I figure I would be playing for a national championship on an undefeated team. 
. . . I just always dreamed of it." 
</P>
<P>
Dream no more.

The Oregon lottery's first day of ticket sales for bets tied to NBA games got 
off to what the head of the lottery said was an expected slow start. 
</P>
<P>
Lottery Director Jim Davey said sales were fairly light for the Sports Action 
game, which until now had been limited to professional football bets. 
</P>
<P>
The lottery commission voted to add NBA contests to the game over the league's 
protest. Davey said betting in the sports game picks up as the weekend 
approaches. And he said this week might not be a good one to measure sales 
because substantial numbers of people are off work between the holidays.

Denver Bronco tackle Gerald Perry was sentenced to 15 days in jail, beginning 
Feb. 5, and a $610 fine after he was convicted of soliciting a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
City Attorney Dave Beard argued for a three-month jail term, calling Perry 
untruthful and questioned the football player's character. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a little disappointed. I felt the circumstances . . . called for a 
slightly longer real jail term," Beard told reporters after the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
Perry's lawyer said he had not decided whether to appeal the sentence. 
</P>
<P>
Aurora Municipal Judge Loretta Hoffine suspended 45 days of the 60-day jail 
sentence if Perry is not arrested on similar charges for a year and continues 
counseling therapy. She also ordered the Perry to serve 100 hours of community 
service. The fine includes $110 in court costs. 
</P>
<P>
The maximum sentence for the misdemeanor penalty is 180 days in jail and a $550 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
A six-member jury found Perry guilty of soliciting a prostitute stemming from 
an incident early Sept. 7. He was acquitted of two other charges, and the jury 
failed to reach a verdict on a third charge.

Former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska denied contacting 1989 
Heisman Trophy winner Andre Ware, but Rodgers said he did buy Ware's mother a 
fur coat and other items. 
</P>
<P>
A sports marketing firm also denied illegal contact with Ware, the University 
of Houston quarterback; and the firm's president accused Texas Secretary of 
State George Bayoud of fining Rodgers and the company for political gain. 
</P>
<P>
Rodgers and Total Economic Athletic Management of America Inc. were fined 
$10,000 each for allegedly violating a Texas law that forbids sports agents 
from contacting players who still have college eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the secretary of state repeated allegations that Rodgers met 
with Ware, a junior, and offered him $20 million if the quarterback would sign 
a professional contract.

A series of small earthquakes has rattled Southern California since Wednesday, 
slightly increasing concern about the possibility of a major jolt on the San 
Jacinto Fault, scientists said today. 
</P>
<P>
A quake with a magnitude of 4.3 at 1:41 a.m. today jarred people awake in an 
area stretching about 120 miles from Los Angeles to east of Palm Springs, but 
no injuries or damage were reported by police and fire agencies that received 
calls from jittery residents. 
</P>
<P>
That quake was the largest of about 10 temblors since Wednesday afternoon 
centered in an area 7 miles northwest of downtown San Bernardino.

A plane that ran low on fuel and made an emergency landing in a field in Simi 
Valley was expected to be cleared for takeoff today from a rural residential 
street west of the city, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
Simi Valley police said the single-engine Cessna, piloted by Michael L. Dimeco 
and carrying his wife and two young children, landed at 5 p.m. Wednesday in the 
vacant field at the southeast corner of Madera Road and Los Angeles Street. 
</P>
<P>
Dimeco told police the plane was almost out of fuel and he had radio 
communication problems that prevented him from contacting an airport. 
</P>
<P>
"That corner is the only one that's not developed," Lt. Dick Thomas said. "It 
was the only place to land in that area." 
</P>
<P>
Police did not know where Dimeco was headed when forced to land. 
</P>
<P>
The Ventura County Transportation Department granted Dimeco a permit this 
morning allowing the refueled plane to take off from Tierra Rejado Road, about 
a mile from where it landed. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol said officers would stop traffic for the takeoff.

three-term member of the state Assembly during the 1930s and most recently a 
Los Angeles Superior Court judge, is dead at age 85. 
</P>
<P>
A family member reported today that the veteran Republican lawmaker and jurist

PANAMA: U.S. DETAINS SENIOR OFFICERS AS HALF A DOZEN OTHER FUGITIVES REMAIN

U.S. forces detained two senior Panamanian military officers as they left the 
Vatican Embassy in Panama City where their former commander, Gen. Manuel A. 
Noriega, remains holed up, a U.S. military spokesman said today. 
</P>
<P>
They are navy commander Col. Arnulfo Castrejon and armed forces chaplain Lt. 
Col. Carlos Velardes, Southern Command spokesman Col. Jerry Murgia told a news 
conference. "They remain in U.S. custody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Panama Archbishop Marcus McGrath said about half a dozen other fugitives remain 
in the embassy with Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
"The obvious intention is to arrive at a moment where he will be the only 
person living inside the Vatican Embassy. It should happen today or tomorrow," 
he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers who left the nunciature were on the armed forces general staff 
and Castrejon was a member of the Military Strategic Council, a select group of 
officers close to Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
Murgia said the two had been arrested in the last 24 hours but did not say how 
long they had been in the nunciature. Castrejon was previously reported to have 
surrendered to the U.S. Army and Murgia did not explain the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
He said that another member of Noriega's general staff, Lt. Col. Rafael Cedeno, 
the deputy director of military intelligence, had surrendered in the last 24 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish state radio said today that two senior Panamanian officers who took 
refuge inside the nunciature with Noriega have asked for political asylum in 
Spain. 
</P>
<P>
It identified them as the former director of the National Department of 
Investigation, Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, and Noriega's personal security 
chief, Capt. Eliecer Gaitan. 
</P>
<P>
Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez told the radio that if no 
lawsuit is pending against the officers there should not be any problem for 
them to settle in Spain. 
</P>
<P>
But he said their biggest difficulty would be whether U.S. troops surrounding 
the mission would allow them to pass. 
</P>
<P>
The standoff at the Vatican Embassy, where Noriega took refuge from invading 
U.S. troops on Christmas Eve, continued with troops and tanks ringing the 
building in the seaside Paitilla district of Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. troops, adopting a novel way of reminding the fugitive of their presence, 
play rock music and news reports on the standoff at high volume over a 
loudspeaker. 
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened to seize Noriega and send him to the United States to 
face drug charges if he sets foot outside the sanctuary of the embassy. But the 
White House acknowledged today that the resolution to the standoff is in the 
Vatican's hands. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican has ruled out turning Noriega over to the United States and 
diplomats say it is seeking to hand him over to Panama or a third country. 
</P>
<P>
McGrath said a solution to the Noriega problem would have to satisfy the 
minimum positions of all parties involved. "Whatever time needs to be taken 
should be taken, otherwise the decision will be hasty and destructive," he 
said.

Former King Michael of Romania said today that the country's new leaders are 
Communists who collaborated with the executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"The people who are at the head of the provisional government are true 
Communists who collaborated with Ceausescu," he said in an interview in the 
French-language daily 24 Heures. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody there knows it," he said. "The Romanians did not fight to be ruled 
once again by the same people. They do not want to continue with the same 
order." 
</P>
<P>
The National Salvation Front named a government Tuesday headed by President Ion 
Iliescu, a former Communist Party Central Committee secretary who was demoted 
after criticizing the Ceausescu regime. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Foreign Minister Corneliu Bogdan said Wednesday that while some of the 
new leaders had been party members, they had all been elected by consensus of 
the Front. Vice President Dumitru Mazilu, who also suffered under Ceausescu, 
pledged Romania would never return to communism. 
</P>
<P>
The Communists forced King Michael, now 68, to abdicate in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
He said he would have preferred a normal trial of Ceausescu and his wife -- 
executed Christmas Day after a swift, secret trial -- but he said it was 
understandable especially in view of the immense hatred the people had for 
Ceausescu. 
</P>
<P>
"I do not like revenge, but this execution was understandable," he said.

A Turkish guard at the Turkish Consulate killed an Italian co-worker in a fit

diplomatic mission. 
</P>

Police identified the victims as Ahmet Gulduoglu, 37, a Turkish policeman 
assigned to guard duty at the consulate, and Italian Vicenzio Di Scala, 
employed for the past 10 years at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
According to investigators, the morning shootings began after consular driver 
Kaliskan Adiguezel, 39, arrived at work and showed a newspaper article to Di 
Scala and Gulduoglu, who had just completed a security inspection of the 
garage.

JAPANESE HALT INQUIRY INTO U.S. H-BOMB LOST OFF COAST IN 1965

The Japanese government said today it is dropping its inquiry into the U.S. 
hydrogen bomb lost at sea 24 years ago off the coast of Japan. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Defense Department had said further queries into the accident could 
endanger U.S. military policy. 
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government understands the U.S. position and has no intention of 
making further requests of it," Kyodo News Service quoted an unidentified 
Foreign Ministry official as saying today. 
</P>
<P>
The case embarrassed both governments -- Japan because it bans nuclear arms but 
appeared to have turned a blind eye to passage of such weapons through its 
waters, and the United States because its policy of not commenting on the 
location of such weapons came under new scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
In 1965, a U.S. Navy A-4 Skyhawk accidentally rolled off the carrier 
Ticonderoga bearing a one-megaton H-bomb. The pilot died, and the bomb sank in 
waters 16,000 feet deep. 
</P>
<P>
The incident was kept secret until 1981, when the Navy said it had occurred 500 
miles from land. 
</P>
<P>
But in May it was disclosed that the bomb had sunk about 80 miles from a 
Japanese island in the Okinawa group.

PRAGUE SPRING HERO DUBCEK ELECTED BY CZECH PARLIAMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander Dubcek was elected Speaker of Parliament today in an extraordinary 
reversal of political fortune for the man ousted as Communist Party chief after 
the 1968 Soviet-led invasion ended his "Prague Spring" reform movement. 
</P>
<P>
Parliament also cleared the way for the election of playwright and opposition 
leader Vaclav Havel as president Friday by dropping a pledge "to serve the 
interests of socialism" from the head of state's oath of office. 
</P>
<P>
"I see this as a sort of continuation of the Prague Spring of 1968 and a 
certain moral vindication for the hundreds of thousands of its active 
participants," Dubcek declared after being elected by a vote of 298 with a lone 
abstention. 
</P>
<P>
"This will become a place where the people's wishes will come true and their 
rights will be respected," he said of the Federal Assembly, the parliamentary 
body whose legislative work he will oversee until free elections are held by 
June. 
</P>
<P>
The Assembly had been a rubber-stamp tool of hard-line Communists until huge 
pro-democracy protests forced them to hand over their guaranteed monopoly on 
political power Nov. 29. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek, 68, gained the post under an accord reached last week among the 
Communist Party, the opposition Civic Forum movement and other political 
groupings, which also provides that Havel will become president. 
</P>
<P>
After Dubcek's Moscow-engineered ouster as party chief in April, 1969, he was 
appointed Federal Assembly chairman for a few months before being sent off to 
Turkey as Czechoslovak ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
He was expelled from the party in June, 1970, and demoted to a forestry job in 
his native Bratislava. Dubcek lived there in obscure retirement until he began 
speaking out against his orthodox successors about two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, as successor to hard-liner Gustav Husak who stepped down Dec. 10, will 
become Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist president since 1948. 
</P>
<P>
Language affirming loyalty to the state -- identified as the Czechoslovak 
Socialist Republic -- remains in the oath of office, although Civic Forum 
suggests that when a new constitution is drafted the word "socialist" be 
deleted from the country's name. 
</P>
<P>
Havel, 53, has maintained that the word has lost all meaning over the last 41 
years of one-party rule. 
</P>
<P>
He is a Czech, while Dubcek is a Slovak. The accord on their elections aimed to 
retain the traditional balance of power in top political posts between the two 
halves of the federated republic. 
</P>
<P>
Dubcek was among a group of 23 new members named by the Assembly to fill seats 
vacated by Communists forced out due to massive public pressure. 
</P>
<P>
Among those named to the new seats were several former dissidents, including 
Charter 77 human rights movement spokesman Tomas Hradilek and Charter activists 
Vaclav Benda and Jaroslav Sabata. 
</P>
<P>
A new government sworn into office as Husak's final act has vowed to hold free 
elections within six months and the reconstructed Assembly will serve until 
then.

Maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin is running for president of the Soviet 
Union's largest republic, a Soviet news service reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, who won more than 5 million votes in Moscow elections with his 
anti-elite stance and calls for more radical reform, has accepted a nomination 
to be president of the Russian Federation, the Interfax news agency said. 
</P>
<P>
Voters in Ramenki, a town near Moscow, nominated him, said Interfax. 
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin was dumped from his job as Moscow party chief in late 1987 for his 
outspoken criticism of the slow pace of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's 
reforms. He was later given a state post in construction with the rank of 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
The 58-year-old former engineer parlayed his image as a fighter for justice and 
victim of the party apparatus into a sweeping victory in March elections for 
the Soviet Congress, when he won 89% of the Moscow vote.

FAMILY GROUP ACTS TO SELL 17% OF CAMPBELL'S

A group of Dorrance family members that controls 17.4% of Campbell Soup Co. 
said today it is filing notice with the Securities and Exchange Commission to 
sell its holdings. 
</P>
<P>
The group said in the filing that it seeks to sell the shares at a price per 
share "significantly in excess of current market value." 
</P>
<P>
Campbell's share soared $4.25 to $57.25 after the announcement, indicating that 
the market expects the group's move to bolster any attempt to take over the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
Camden, N.J.-based Campbell's has been the object of buyout rumors since the 
death in April of John Dorrance Jr., a former Campbell chairman who was 
dedicated to the 120-year-old company's independence. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance's three children said a week ago that they were committed to keeping 
Campbell's independent. They control 31% of the world's largest soup maker. 
</P>
<P>
In today's filing, the group -- consisting of nephews and nieces of Dorrance -- 
said it would prefer the sale of its stock to be part of a tax-free 
transaction, although it said such a deal would not be a necessity. It also 
said it will explore methods of advancing the prospect of such a transaction 
and will support others who are likely to advance its objectives. 
</P>
<P>
The group said it will oppose any attempt by the company to block moves that 
would push up the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
It said that if the board takes action to oppose a sale at a price the group 
believes "reflects fairly the full value of the company," the group will 
consider pressing for changes in the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
The family group making the filing consists of Dorrance Hamilton and Samuel 
Hamilton, Hope van Beuren and John van Beuren, Diana Norris and Charles Norris 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
Dorrance Hamilton is a member of Campbell's board. John van Beuren and Charles 
Norris were trustees of Campbell's recently dissolved major shareholders voting 
trust, which represented about 27% of Campbell's outstanding shares, including 
those owned by the family group making the filing.

DALLAS ENTREPRENEUR SEEKS TO BUY BRANIFF

A Dallas entrepreneur who tried last year to establish an airline for smokers 
now wants to purchase Braniff Inc., a newspaper reported today. 
</P>
<P>
Kay Cohlmia was to meet with representatives of the troubled carrier today, he 
told the Orlando Sentinel in a telephone interview. He said he has arranged 
financing but would not give details. 
</P>
<P>
Orlando-based Braniff filed for bankruptcy protection on Sept. 28 and has been 
short of cash since. 
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the carrier's unsecured creditors said they have not been 
approached by Cohlmia. 
</P>
<P>
In October, Braniff hired Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, an investment banking 
company, to find sources of financing, including possible buyers. 
</P>
<P>
Cohlmia, 54, said he worked for Braniff as a baggage handler in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
"I love that airline," he said. "It could be the best -- and will be -- if we 
buy it." 
</P>
<P>
Describing himself as a "hustler and an idea man," Cohlmia said he would turn 
Braniff into a service-oriented airline catering to business fliers. 
</P>
<P>
For 20 years, he operated Cohlmia Aviation Inc., which at its peak used a fleet 
of more than 60 planes to ferry checks among banks, he said. It ceased 
operating in December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Cohlmia helped set up the Great American Smokers Club, an organization 
based in Texas that wanted to form an airline for smokers only.

The Panama Canal returned to normal 24-hour operations today and 38 ships were 
scheduled to pass through the strategic Atlantic-Pacific waterway, its 
Washington headquarters said. 
</P>
<P>
"We are back to normal operations. . . . Things are beginning to fall into 
place and efficiency at the canal will pick up," said Michael Rhode, secretary 
of the Panama Canal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
The canal was closed for the first time in its 75-year history for other than 
landslides after U.S. forces invaded Panama last week to capture military 
strongman Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega. The waterway was later reopened on a 
limited basis. 
</P>
<P>
There were 135 ships waiting to transit at midnight Wednesday with 42 more 
vessels expected to arrive today, Rhode said. 
</P>
<P>
"The work force is returning and we expect normal operations unless something 
unforeseen happens," he added.

FILM UPSETS HUDSON'S SECRETARY 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The former secretary to the late Rock Hudson said today he is upset over a 
movie to air on ABC-TV that he said falsely depicts his role in the life of the 
actor who died of AIDS in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
Mark Miller, 63, said he believes that a film titled "Rock Hudson," scheduled 
to air Jan. 8 as a "Monday Night At The Movies" feature, knowingly depicts an 
inaccurate picture of the former secretary's role in Hudson's life. 
</P>
<P>
"They've established my character as Mr. Big, (which) is not true at all," 
Miller said in an interview from his home in Hawaii. "My life is being made 
into a lie." 
</P>
<P>
However, the attorney for Konigsberg/Sanitsky Co., which produced the movie for 
ABC, said the script is based on information from this year's court case 
involving Hudson's former lover, Marc Christian. 
</P>
<P>
Christian successfully sued the actor's estate, claiming that the fact that 
Hudson had AIDS was deliberately kept from him while the two were involved 
intimately. 
</P>
<P>
Other parts of the script came from interviews with undisclosed sources, 
attorney Susan Schaefer said.

A benefit concert Wednesday night featuring the pop music band New Kids on the 
Block was canceled when hundreds of ardent fans, mostly screaming teen-age 
girls, surged forward and threatened to overrun the stage. 
</P>
<P>
The band appeared at Boston's World Trade Center for about one minute before 
retreating backstage to avoid the crush. "The kids were hysterical," said John 
Drew, head of the trade center. No arrests or major injuries were reported in 
the crush, but one report said several fans fainted or cried in the excitement 
and dozens of girls tried to sneak backstage to meet band members. 
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 concert-goers -- primarily teen-age girls and their parents -- 
attended the show, a benefit for Boston Against Drugs. New Kid Donnie Wahlberg 
called the fan attention "flattering." Backstage, the band presented Boston 
Against Drugs a $25,000 check. 
</P>
<P>
The band appeared in concert in Los Angeles earlier this month, without 
incident.

Staff at a plush restaurant found themselves serving turkey on a silver platter 
to a dog whose name was chosen in a raffle over hundreds of human contestants. 
</P>
<P>
The cocker spaniel, appropriately named Lucky, was entered in the competition 
by his owner, Phyllis Walmsley of Shanklin, on the Isle of Wight, off England's 
southern coast. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people entered the raffle organized by the 1st Shanklin Scouts 
group, but Lucky was the winner of the first prize of a Christmas meal at a top 
restaurant on the island. 
</P>
<P>
Alan Priddle, owner of the Cottage Restaurant, said today that he settled Lucky 
down at a table with a platter of turkey Dec. 18. The restaurant owner skipped 
the potatoes and turnip. 
</P>
<P>
"We thought we'd just stick to the meat," Priddle said. "He ate all the turkey, 
yes." 
</P>
<P>
He added: "The dog was very well behaved. The only time he growled was when we 
tried to put a party hat on his head."

Irish government minister Pat Gallagher has married a woman who spent nine 
years in a British jail on Irish Republican Army bomb-plot charges. 
</P>
<P>
Gallagher married former IRA prisoner Ann Gillespie on Wednesday at a church 
near their homes in Donegal, northwest Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
Gillespie and her sister Eileen were jailed for 15 years in 1975 for conspiring 
to cause explosions and possessing explosives. The trial judge called them 
"sinister and evil IRA bombers." The IRA is fighting to oust Britain from 
Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
While the sisters were in jail, Gallagher campaigned actively to have them 
transferred to Ireland to complete their sentences. They were released five 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
When their romance was first revealed in February, Gallagher said: "Ann is a 
very nice girl and she has suffered enough. She served nine years in prison and 
now deserves a chance of a normal life."

LIZ SMITH: U.N. COULD GET FIRST WOMAN SECRETARY GENERAL

<P>
THE UNITED NATIONS is a hotbed of progressive ferment these days, which is a 
delightful change for that conservative body. Perhaps the fantastic changes 
taking place in Europe are the cause. On Dec. 13, this column reported that 
Kenya's ambassador to the United Nations, Michael George Okeyo, might well be 
the one to take over the top spot of secretary general when Javier Perez de 
Cuellar steps down. And, if this happens, Okeyo will become the first black 
ever to head the world body. 
</P>
<P>
Now another rumor is abounding, and Okeyo seems to have developed some 
competition. Many delegates hope to push for the first female secretary general 
should De Cuellar retire after his first term ends. There are a number of 
female candidates, with Undersecretary Terese P. Sevigny, a French Canadian, in 
the lead. 
</P>
<P>
RAN INTO one of my all-time favorite creatures -- the comic actor Richard Lewis 
-- who was bouncing around at NBC this week saying what a nervous wreck he was 
over his Carnegie Hall one-man concert. Naturally, it was a sellout and a 
standout. 
</P>
<P>
Richard is the genial, good-natured co-star (with Jamie Lee Curtis) of the 
television hit series "Anything But Love." He said that next Wednesday night, 
he and Jamie Lee will offer their first segment in which the writer 
protagonists get really romantic. 
</P>
<P>
"We filmed our love scene in a bed in a hotel setting. We were like an Amish 
couple. We were so intimidated. We were Goofy and Minnie making love. Jamie 
Lee's husband was in the audience and so was my girlfriend. So we were 
embarrassed by the whole thing. Believe me, you can't have loved ones watching 
you act!" 
</P>
<P>
Richard is a darling guy who really deserves his booming success. Happy New 
Year, Richard, and continued poor posture in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
I ASKED sports maven Michael Lupica to sum up the most important thing about 
Billy Martin's death on the day after the controversial baseball man died in a 
car accident. Mike gave a good answer about how Martin was a man beloved by New 
Yorkers and other sports fans and how he'd always have a place in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
True. But in my opinion, not the most important thing. The death of Billy 
Martin is one more cautionary tale about non-use of seat belts. I can just 
envision Billy and his longtime friend William Reedy as they got in that truck 
to drive to Billy's house in Upstate New York. Neither of these macho guys 
wanted to be the first sissy to fasten his seat belt. So neither did. Billy 
Martin needn't have died. 
</P>
<P>
I know because several years ago I had almost the same kind of accident in the 
same locale on an icy road. My car went through a guardrail, fell down a 
60-foot ravine and turned over five times. I got out of the car and walked up 
to the top of the ravine to the highway where a state trooper was rushing 
toward me. He said: "Don't bother to tell me. You were wearing your seat belt, 
right?" He was correct. He added, "It had to be because I've never unbuckled a 
dead person." 
</P>
<P>
Billy Martin is due whatever his place is in baseball and sport history. But 
the most important event of his life is that he died when he didn't have to all 
over a small, macho gesture of defiance against fate and the odds. But you 
don't have to follow his bad example. 
</P>

"SATURDAY NIGHT with Connie Chung" postponed its year-end roundup of

Brown University today acknowledged that Lafayette head Coach Bill Russo turned 
down the top coaching spot at the Ivy League school but would not comment on 
reports that a Nebraska coach had also been offered the post. 
</P>
<P>
"Russo was offered the job and did not accept it," said Brown athletic 
department spokesman Christopher Humm. 
</P>
<P>
Russo, a former Brown assistant coach and linebacker, visited Brown last week 
but turned down the offer because of family considerations and "the support 
I've received from the Lafayette administration." 
</P>
<P>
Humm would not confirm that Ron Brown, another former Brown football player and 
the receiver coach at Nebraska, had also been offered the job, vacated earlier 
this month when John Rosenberg resigned.

Ben Johnson will start the 1990s recognized as the world's fastest man, but he 
may be formally stripped of his records a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Gee, technical director for the International Amateur Athletic Federation, 
said it will be Jan. 19 at the earliest before the IAAF meets to decide whether 
to wipe Johnson's name from the record books. Johnson's records in the 100 
meters and in the indoor 50- and 60-meter dashes risk being expunged. If 
Johnson is stripped of the 100-meter mark, the record would belong to American 
Carl Lewis for his 9.92-second dash at the Seoul Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who lost his gold medal at the 1988 Seoul Olympics when he failed a 
drug test, passed a doping test when he set the 100-meter world record of 9.83 
seconds at the World Championships in Rome in August, 1987.

The Sugar Bowl is still several days away, but Miami and Alabama have already 
met. 
</P>
<P>
In a bar. In the French Quarter. Late at night. 
</P>
<P>
"We gave them some hard stares, and they gave us some. I think everybody was 
waiting for us to start throwing bottles," Miami's Mike Sullivan said. "But 
there's not going to be any of that." 
</P>
<P>
There was, however, some serious razzing on Bourbon Street early Wednesday. It 
happened when about 30 Miami players ran into a slightly smaller group of 
Alabama players. 
</P>
<P>
"We were yapping at each other, and words were exchanged," Miami wide receiver 
Dale Dawkins said. "Things like, 'Dale Dawkins, you better not come over the 
middle against us.' I told them I'd been doing it all year." 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama types responded with tomahawk signs. Those represent the war cry of 
Florida State, the only team to beat Miami this season. 
</P>
<P>
The Hurricanes countered, Dawkins said, by "growling like tigers." The Auburn 
Tigers were the only team to stop Alabama this year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing a lot of talking," Alabama star running back Siran Stacy said. 
"That's their style." 
</P>
<P>
"But they usually back up what they say," Stacy admitted. "It's their way of 
trying to intimidate you. And if you listen too much, you might start to 
believe them and be intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
Both teams are 10-1, although the second-ranked Hurricanes are nine-point 
favorites, the biggest spread in any major bowl. While Miami hopes to win its 
third national championship of the decade, the seventh-ranked Crimson Tide has 
no chance of taking the title. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we should be in the picture, but probably we're not," Alabama 
quarterback Gary Hollingsworth said. "But we lost late in the season, and that 
hurts." 
</P>
<P>
Neither team was feeling much pain after touring New Orleans on Tuesday night. 
Big-city kids and country boys alike were surprised by the things that show up 
around New Year's time. 
</P>
<P>
"People kept warning us to be careful, to stay away from the riffraff," said 
Sullivan, originally from Chicago. "But I kind of went looking for riffraff. I 
wanted to see it." 
</P>
<P>
Teammate Russell Maryland, another Chicago native, liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a lot wilder than I expected," he said. "Especially all of those strip 
joints." 
</P>
<P>
Alabama's Lamonde Russell wanted to see the sights, especially the ones they 
don't have back home in Oneonta, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have any buildings over two stories tall in my hometown. I live in a 
county that's dry," he said. "So you know we definitely saw some things that 
you wouldn't want your kids to see."

Even though the talking between the Miami and Alabama players got a little 
nasty, later on the groups got together and chatted amicably. Well, almost 
everyone did. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't talk to them," Bernard Clark, Miami's fired-up linebacker, said. "I 
ain't going to be a friend of theirs. I ain't going to hold a socialization."

Gov. Mario M. Cuomo today vetoed legislation that would have put the closed 
Tioga Park Racetrack near Binghamton into business as a thoroughbred facility. 
</P>
<P>
Cuomo said that although he favors opening the track because of the jobs it 
would create in the Southern Tier, he is also concerned that harness tracks 
across New York state would be hurt by the Tioga facility's operation. 
</P>
<P>
"I remain convinced, however, that a solution is not only desirable but also 
possible," said Cuomo in his veto message. 
</P>
<P>
The governor said he would submit new legislation next year designed to bring 
about the opening of Tioga Park while offering protection to the harness 
tracks. 
</P>
<P>
The harness tracks had complained that Tioga Park, because it would be running 
at night, would be direct competition for them. The state's other thoroughbred 
tracks run in the afternoon.
