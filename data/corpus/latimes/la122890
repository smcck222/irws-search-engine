PURSUING SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
LAWYER LAUNCHES NEW BOARD GAME BASED ON QUOTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Whoever first said, "Take a good idea and run with it," must have had George 
Chanos in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego lawyer took a leave of absence from his law firm this year to 
promote Notable Quotables, a game he invented that is selling well in San Diego 
stores amid a spattering of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
"It's being heralded as the next Trivial Pursuit," the enthusiastic 32-year-old 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The game hit store shelves Nov. 29, just in time for Christmas shoppers. 
Nordstrom and local game stores are reporting strong sales, with Notable 
Quotables rivaling Trivial Pursuit, Scattergories and Taboo in quantities sold, 
games licensed by giants in the hard-to-enter toy industry with a lot of 
advertising dollars behind them. 
</P>
<P>
"You would expect them to be blowing us out of the water," Chanos said. 
</P>
<P>
Chanos has sold 4,489 copies of the game to date, and is confident he will sell 
511 more, or the rest of the games manufactured, by January. He said he has 
already met with Parker Brothers and other game companies to discuss a possible 
licensing agreement and is anxiously waiting to introduce the game to the 
nation at the New York Toy Fair in February. 
</P>
<P>
Notable Quotables challenges players to match provocative quotations with the 
famous people who uttered them. Less celebrity-conscious players can opt to 
fill in a missing word from a quote rather than guess who said it. Answers are 
provided in a 
</P>
<P>
multiple-choice format, so "you always have something to say and you have a 
33.3% chance of being right," Chanos said. 
</P>
<P>
There are quotes from Madonna and Charles Manson, from Albert Einstein and 
Leona Helmsley. Chanos' criteria were that the quotes be funny, profound or 
risque. 
</P>
<P>
"The game mirrors society," he said. "It's the news over the past five years 
condensed in a box." 
</P>
<P>
But getting the game off the drawing board and into the stores took five years 
of almost obsessive dedication, during which Chanos used his business savvy and 
magnetic personality to sell the idea to everyone from investors to 
manufacturers to the lawyers he worked for. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began the revolution with 82 men. It does not matter how small you are if 
you have faith and a plan of action."-Fidel Castro 
</P>
<P>
Chanos first started collecting quotes while attending law school at the 
University of San Diego. He originally planned to publish a book of quotes, but 
during his last year of law school, in 1984, he came across a magazine article 
about Trivial Pursuit, which posted $750 million in sales just one year after 
being introduced. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a huge, huge amount of money," he said. "You could buy all of Eastern 
Airlines for $500 million." 
</P>
<P>
The article detailed how the inventors of Trivial Pursuit struggled to get 
people to notice them, persevered and eventually became millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
Chanos understood how difficult it is to introduce a new game in the toy 
industry, where thousands of new games are invented each year, some by large 
companies and some by individuals like Chanos, only to never be heard of again. 
</P>
<P>
But he strongly believed in his idea, and decided to minimize his risk by 
researching the game industry, studying why some games fail while others 
succeed. He met with successful game inventors and traveled to the New York Toy 
Fair. 
</P>
<P>
He started a habit he maintains to this day of reading through a hundred 
publications each week, most of which are unsold throwaways he gets from a 
distributor. Five hundred magazines translates to about 50 quotes he feels are 
appropriate for his game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I would believe what I read about myself, I would hate my guts, too."-Zsa 
Zsa Gabor 
</P>
<P>
In 1989, Chanos developed a prototype version of the game, bartering work from 
designers in exchange for shares in a small company he created called 
GameMakers Ltd., which owns the rights to the game. 
</P>
<P>
During this time, he became a successful lawyer practicing business litigation 
and transactional work for San Diego's Lorenz Alhadeff Lundin &amp; Oggel. But, 
during his third year there, he decided to step off the partnership track and 
work on Notable Quotables full time. 
</P>
<P>
The law firm was sold on the idea also, offering Chanos a job if things didn't 
work out, and drawing up an investment package in exchange for a stake in 
GameMakers. 
</P>
<P>
By 1990, Chanos had raised $400,000 from investors, who included fellow 
lawyers, former clients, Alex Spanos, the owner of the San Diego Chargers, Mary 
Papas, the owner of Athens Market, and others. 
</P>
<P>
Many were won over more by Chanos than his idea. 
</P>
<P>
"I invested in the person," said Donald Cohn, president of DataQuick, a San 
Diego-based on-line information service. "I invested in George." 
</P>
<P>
Cohn said he usually goes for more traditional investments, but was so 
impressed with Chanos' thoroughness, which included market studies, that he 
simply felt it was a worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The 
game is what counts."-Aristotle Onassis 
</P>
<P>
The stores Chanos approached with his game are also glad they decided to 
believe in him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's done better than I had anticipated," said David Lyon, a buyer for the 
four Nordstrom department stores in San Diego County. Lyon said he looks for a 
unique game each holiday season for the men's department, and this year he 
chose Notable Quotables. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the game, which retails for $39.95, accounted for a major percentage 
of total sales for the department, especially on weekends when Chanos 
demonstrates the game to passing customers, Lyon said. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have another single item, except socks and belts, that sells more than 
this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Chanos believes the game is popular because people are fascinated by the famous 
and what they have to say. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of people in the country that like quotations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Also, the timing is perfect. People played Trivial Pursuit and Pictionary. 
They got used to a big new game every three to four years. I think people are 
waiting for this." 
</P>
<P>
And what is Chanos' favorite quote? 
</P>
<P>
"Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever hope to achieve greatly." Robert 
F. Kennedy. 
</P>

3 JEWELRY STORES PLACED OFF-LIMITS; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: THREE STORES, INCLUDING DOWNTOWN GIANT JEWELRY, ARE PUT OFF-LIMITS 
BECAUSE OF ALLEGED HIGH-PRESSURE SALES TACTICS AND INFLATED PRICES. 
</P>

Three San Diego County jewelry stores have been placed off-limits to military 
personnel after more than 90 sailors and Marines complained of high-pressure 
sales tactics and inflated prices, Navy officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Young recruits, many awaiting orders for Operation Desert Shield, told the 
legal affairs office that they were pressured into buying overpriced jewelry -- 
including 14-carat gold crosses decorated with diamonds and sapphires -- for 
their parents, said Cmdr. Steve Epstein, judge advocate general for San Diego 
Naval Base headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein identified the San Diego stores as Giant Jewelry Co., 308 W. Broadway, 
San Diego; S &amp; S Enterprises, 2702 Lytton St., San Diego, and Sound 
Stations, 213-B N. Hill St., Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
The store manager at Giant Jewelry declined comment, referring calls to the 
store's attorney, who was not available. No one answered calls at the other two 
locations. Epstein said, however, that the stores have denied using 
high-pressure sales techniques. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said his office has passed the information to the district attorney's 
office and to the Better Business Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said sales people would target raw recruits. He said sales people would 
go out on the street in front of the stores and entice the recruits inside with 
offers of free pizza, coupons to area restaurants or offers to play pool and 
watch television inside. 
</P>
<P>
"The common practice was to lean on these kids and prey on their immaturity," 
he said. Many are young and away from home for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
Sales people would ask who was the most important woman in their lives and when 
they said their mother, sales people would give them a mom-and-apple-pie pitch, 
Epstein continued. They would ask recruits when was the last time they had 
written to their moms and urge them to do something nice for her. 
</P>
<P>
Sales people would also physically block the door to keep the recruits from 
leaving, he said. "It was not an isolated thing. It was a common thread 
throughout the cases." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said some of recruits told him they had bought pieces for as much as 
$699 and had them appraised for as little as $100. 
</P>
<P>
"We understand merchants have to turn a profit," Epstein said. "But, if these 
folks were selling the same merchandise at a mall, would they be selling it at 
$700 a pop? My belief is they would not." 
</P>
<P>
Epstein said his legal affairs office has complained to the stores for three 
years without success. He said the three stores were all owned by Giant Jewelry 
when contacted in July, but two of the stores have since been sold. 
</P>
<P>
Putting an establishment off-limits is a last resort, Epstein said. But, 
because complaints have continued, Navy and Marine personnel have been ordered 
not to frequent the stores. 
</P>
<P>
"We can't tell the stores what to do, but we can tell Navy and Marine Corps 
personnel they cannot go into those stores," Epstein said. 
</P>
<P>
The order was issued by the Armed Forces Disciplinary Control Board, which 
considers reports and takes action against establishments that are determined 
to be detrimental to the health and well-being of military personnel.

A GUARD ON HARD TIMES FINDS ARSON SUSPECT; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: 'CAPTAIN HOOK' SHRUGS OFF MEDIA ATTENTION AFTER DISCOVERING THE MAN IN 
THE RESTROOM OF A STUDIO CITY RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL CONNELLY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As authorities announced the arrest of a suspect Thursday in the string of 
Ventura Boulevard arson fires that caused $2.5 million in damages, an 
improbable hero emerged: a down on his luck, one-armed security guard known as 
"Captain Hook." 
</P>
<P>
Harold Van Buskirk, 44, identified a man loitering in a restroom at Charles' 
restaurant in Studio City as the suspect just minutes after the waitress he 
orders coffee from each morning gave him a detailed description of the arson 
suspect authorities were seeking. 
</P>
<P>
"It was wild," said Van Buskirk, who lives in a motor home he parks in Studio 
City parking lots. "We were talking about this arsonist running around loose 
and I walk into the bathroom and there he is, just standing there." 
</P>
<P>
The coincidence was so strange that the waitress, Colleen Stinchfield, 29, 
didn't believe Van Buskirk when he first told her the news. 
</P>
<P>
"I said, 'No way,' " Stinchfield said. "I thought he was kidding around because 
we were just talking about this guy and then he says that he saw him in the 
restroom." 
</P>
<P>
But Van Buskirk convinced Stinchfield, whose family has owned Charles' since 
1954. About a half hour later, police officers entered the restroom and 
arrested John Kellogges, 37, a transient. Police said his clothes smelled of 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
Within hours, Van Buskirk became the main figure in a story where numerous 
citizens were credited by authorities with first providing a detailed 
description of the suspect and then helping to apprehend him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've had the Daily News, L.A. Times and Channels 2, 4, 7 and 11 out here," he 
said while standing outside the 30-foot motor home with his dog, Rocky. "I got 
a message that some other channel wants to meet me at 4. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody is saying I was the hero, but I'm no hero. I just did what I 
should've done. If he was the guy, I didn't want him to get away." 
</P>
<P>
Van Buskirk shrugged at all the attention and said he usually only draws the 
interest of RTD security officers who tell him he can't park his motor home in 
the Ventura Boulevard commuter lot near Riverton Avenue. He said he is often 
shooed away from the lot but returns because he has nowhere else to go and 
little money to rent space for his 13-year-old motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Van Buskirk lost his left arm in a childhood accident. He's known by friends in 
the neighborhood and regulars at Charles' restaurant as "Captain Hook" because 
he once had a steel hook prosthesis. "But I got rid of it because I kept 
scratching myself with it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said he lives on Social Security payments and money from odd jobs in the 
neighborhood. He also takes occasional security jobs at area construction 
sites, but it has been several weeks since he has been hired. He said he had to 
borrow $20 this week to buy propane to heat his motor home. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the hard luck, he said he wasn't looking for anything in return for his 
help in arresting the arson suspect. However, he said, maybe it will help him 
find more work as a security guard. 
</P>
<P>
Stinchfield agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"Captain Hook looks out for this neighborhood," she said. "He is a good person 
to have around."

PARENTS OF DROWNED BOY SUE OVER BROKEN FENCE; 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT: CANAL FENCE BUILT 9 YEARS AGO ON SAN PASQUAL INDIAN RESERVATION AFTER 
DEATH OF ANOTHER TODDLER WASN'T MAINTAINED, ACCORDING TO SUIT, WHICH SEEKS $24 
MILLION IN DAMAGES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The family of a 2-year-old boy who drowned in a canal June 15 on the San 
Pasqual Indian Reservation filed a $24-million lawsuit Thursday that charged 
the city of Escondido and the Vista Irrigation District with failing to 
maintain a fence through which the toddler crawled. 
</P>
<P>
Bani Reyes spent 10 minutes under water before a 16-year-old girl squeezed 
through a hole in the fence and grabbed him as he floated by. Paramedics tried 
to revive the toddler, who died 12 hours later. In 1981, 2-year old Melissa 
Varella drowned in the same canal, which flows into Lake Wohlford and Lake 
Henshaw. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit, filed in San Diego Superior Court on behalf of the boy's mother 
and father, Miguel and Oliva Reyes, and brother and sister, Isai and Eonise, 
asks for $6 million for each family member. 
</P>
<P>
C. Bradley Hallen, the family's attorney, said officials from the city and 
water district put up the 8-foot fence that lines each side of the canal after 
Varella's death nine years ago but failed to patch the holes that have since 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
John Schell, an attorney for the irrigation district, said he had not seen the 
lawsuit and could not comment. A spokeswoman for the Escondido city attorney's 
office said the city had not yet been served. 
</P>
<P>
The Reyes family lived in a mobile home on the Indian reservation on a plot 
they rented from the San Pasqual Indians. The canal was 25 to 30 feet from 
their home, Hallen said. 
</P>
<P>
On the day of the drowning, Bani Reyes was playing with his 6-year-old brother, 
Isai, when Bani crawled under the chain-link fence, Hallen said. 
</P>
<P>
Someone called Oliva Reyes, who ran with neighborhood residents to the canal. 
Maria Garcia, 16, heard the mother's screams, scrambled to a hole in the fence 
downstream and plucked the toddler from the swift-moving current. 
</P>
<P>
"The hole wasn't enough to let an adult through," Hallen said. "So they ran 
downstream and the first large enough hole was a half-mile down the canal. They 
pulled the child out but he was unconscious and died the next day." 
</P>
<P>
The fence was repaired the day after Reyes died, Hallen said. 
</P>
<P>
In 1981, Melissa Crystal Varella wandered about 150 yards from her home while 
her mother was taking a shower and dropped into the canal. U.S. Border Patrol 
officers and sheriff's deputies found the girl's body about 200 yards below the 
pumping station at Old Juajita Road and Lake Wohlford. 
</P>
<P>
After Varella's death, several bands of Indians on the reservation were angry 
with the Escondido Mutual Water Co. and asked that the canal be made safer. 
Several people protested what they said was the water company's inaction by 
dumping trash in the canal. 
</P>
<P>
The Indians demanded that the canal be covered or a safety fence erected. 
</P>
<P>
"They opted to fence the canal as the least expensive alternative," Hallen 
said. "In the years thereafter, they permitted the fence to fall in disrepair 
and didn't prevent people from gaining access." 
</P>
<P>
Hallen filed a claim in August with the city of Escondido and the Vista 
Irrigation District, which jointly maintain the canal. The claim was rejected.

COLD FRONT MAY SPARK RECORD USE OF ELECTRICITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By G. JEANETTE AVENT, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
Cold weather coupled with the holidays is expected to set another record for 
electricity use this weekend, just days after San Diegans broke the old record, 
utility officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday morning, the demand for electricity reached almost 1,500 megawatts 
-- nearly 1.5 billion watts of electricity, said Fred Vaughn, spokesman for San 
Diego Gas &amp; Electric. On an average day, usage is about 1,200 megawatts at 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
The temperature Sunday was 36, a record for that date, according to the 
National Weather Service in San Diego. The previous low for Dec. 23 was 37 
degrees in 1891. 
</P>
<P>
Cold air is coming south like an express train from the Yukon, forecaster 
Wilbur Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
The front brings with it a 20% chance of rain and snowfall today, but skies 
will turn clear and cold through New Year's Day, Shigehara said. Temperatures 
in downtown San Diego will approach record lows in the upper 30s on Sunday and 
Monday nights, he said. 
</P>
<P>
No overflow damage is expected, but the highest high tides in 17 years are also 
expected Monday, he said, adding that tides will peak at 7.8 feet at 8:14 a.m. 
Monday. Beach-goers should be wary of waves that can come in by surprise during 
high tide, Shigehara said. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures at the beaches today should range from 60 to 65, 58 to 62 
Saturday, and 52 to 56 Sunday and Monday. The surf is 2 to 4 feet, and the 
water temperature is a nippy 57 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Coastal temperatures will hover between 59 and 65 today, 55 to 60 Saturday, and 
53 to 58 Sunday and Monday, Shigehara said. Nighttime lows of 40 to 50 are

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: ESCONDIDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two alleged gang members from the Los Angeles area were sentenced Thursday for 
their roles in the $342,000 armed robbery of the jewelry counter in the 
Robinson's department store in North County Fair on July 27. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Deshawnn London, 18, was sentenced to 12 years in state prison, and 
co-defendant Corey Anthony Williams, 25, was sentenced to 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
The two were convicted of two counts of armed robbery, two counts of auto 
theft, one count of assault with a deadly weapon and one count of burglary. 
</P>
<P>
A hearing to determine how much restitution should be paid was set by Superior 
Court Judge David M. Gill for Jan. 11, the same day that two other defendants 
will be sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
According to Deputy Dist. Atty. Jeffrey Brodrick, the two are gang members and 
the holdup generally matches other Southern Californian robberies attributed to 
various Los Angeles neighborhood groups associated with the Crips. 
</P>
<P>
Brodrick said only about $8,000 worth of jewelry was recovered when the four 
were arrested. He said that, in similar crimes, the weapon and most of the 
jewelry is handed off to accomplices.

<P>
U.S. Border Patrol agents seized 760 pounds of marijuana from a pickup whose 
driver crossed the border but escaped back into Mexico on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Agents said they saw a 1986 blue Ford Ranger pickup with a camper shell drive 
through a hole in the border fence about a mile west of the San Ysidro Port of 
Entry. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol spokesman Michael Gregg said the agents tried to head off the 
pickup, but it made a U-turn back to Mexico. When the truck got stuck in the 
sand about 100 feet north of the border fence, the driver jumped out and 
escaped into Mexico, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Gregg said Thursday's seizure has a street value of about $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
He said members of Operation Alliance -- a task force of agents from the 
federal Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Border Patrol and U.S Customs 
-- have seized more than 3 tons of marijuana, worth an estimated $9.7 million, 
since Oct. 1, the beginning of the federal fiscal year.

LOUIS C. CAVALLARO; PRINT SHOP OWNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Louis C. Cavallaro, owner of Flash Printing Service in Reseda, has died in a 
Northridge hospital. He was 61. 
</P>
<P>
The Reseda resident died Tuesday of a heart attack, said his wife, Jane 
Cavallaro. 
</P>
<P>
Born May 30, 1929, in Waltham, Mass., Cavallaro came to California as a child 
and graduated from Bell High School. During the 1960s and 1970s, he owned two 
used-car lots in the San Fernando Valley called J Motors. In 1976, he opened 
Flash Printing Service, which he ran until his death. Cavallaro was also active 
in the Community Organization of Reseda, a group of business owners who 
recently formed to oppose a Reseda revitalization effort. 
</P>
<P>
He is survived by his wife of 27 years; son Louis Cavallaro Jr. of Reseda; 
daughters Tina Cavallaro and Sandy Cavallaro of Reseda; mother Vincenta Batte 
of Reseda; brother Charles Cavallaro of Massachusetts; and sisters Lena 
DiScuillo and Marie Farley of Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for 11 a.m. Saturday at Lorenzen Mortuary, 
19300 Sherman Way, which is handling the arrangements. Contributions can be 
made in Cavallaro's name to a charity of the donor's choice.

<P>
It is significant that it was a black man who made the recent education 
department decision prohibiting the award of scholarships solely on the basis 
of race. To prove their devotion and loyalty to the conservative cause, such 
individuals sometime become even more zealous and dogmatic than their white 
conservative counterparts, to the detriment of those of their own race. 
</P>
<P>
Pity the poor black man who gets in their way.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: RESIDENTS CAN TRADE YULE TREES FOR COMPOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Sanitation Department is urging residents to trade in their 
Christmas trees for a free bag of compost at a tree recycling drop-off point, 
including sites in Sunland and Encino. 
</P>
<P>
City workers will accept trees at the seven sites until Jan. 5. The sites will 
be closed on New Year's Day, a city spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
The city expects to turn more than 10,000 trees into compost and save 100 tons 
of landfill space, she said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Valley area sites, open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., are at the Balboa 
Sports Center, 17000 Burbank Blvd., and Sunland Park and Recreation Center, 
8651 Foothill Blvd.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: WOMAN GETS YEAR IN MONEY-ORDER THEFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Lancaster woman was sentenced to a year in County Jail on Thursday for 
stealing more than $12,000 in money orders from the San Fernando mail-order 
company where she worked. 
</P>
<P>
Estelita Vasquez Asmar, 43, pleaded guilty in October to one count each of 
grand theft of personal property and forgery of checks for altering hundreds of 
money orders made out to the United States Purchasing Exchange and depositing 
them in her bank account between January and November, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
According to court records, Asmar changed money orders sent to the company so 
they appeared to be made out to Onited Btates Rordhasing Bychange and cashed 
them at local check-cashing outlets. She then deposited the money in a bank 
account under the name of Onite Rordhasing Bychange Corp., a front company for 
which she received a business license from the city of Los Angeles in 
September, 1988, Deputy Dist. Atty. Steven Jay Ipsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the money orders were for sums between $5 and $15, Ipsen said. 
</P>
<P>
Also being sought in connection with the scam are Asmar's two daughters, 
Joselyn Garcia, 21, and Maridona Garcia, 25, Ipsen said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando Superior Court Judge Malcom Mackey suspended Asmar's sentence for 
a month so she could raise money to reimburse her former employer. He said he 
would re-evaluate the sentence at that time, depending on whether Asmar makes 
an effort to repay the stolen money.

In his article on minority scholarships (Commentary, Dec. 18) Clarence Page 
quotes Booker T. Washington: "No greater injury can be done to any youth than 
to let him feel that because he belongs to this or that race he will be 
advanced regardless of his own merit or efforts." 
</P>
<P>
Certainly there are many minority youths who would be willing to suffer these 
same injuries so long endured by white, Protestant males.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: 3 PLEAD INNOCENT IN MARIJUANA FARM CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Three people accused of acting as a sales team for a network of underground 
marijuana farms in the Antelope Valley and Arizona pleaded not guilty Thursday 
to felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Kumar, 31; Gabriel Alfred, 29; and Elizabeth Haskell, 26, were charged 
with one count each of conspiracy to sell marijuana and conspiracy to possess 
marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
They were arrested in connection with the widening investigation into the 
sophisticated farms uncovered in the past month by Los Angeles County sheriff's 
deputies and federal Drug Enforcement Administration agents. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, Haskell and Kumar were charged with one count each of possession 
of marijuana for sale. 
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested Nov. 30 in Castaic after Kumar allegedly attempted to 
buy 30 pounds of marijuana for $105,000 from undercover sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities have said they suspect Kumar of being the top distributor of 
marijuana grown in the high-tech farms allegedly built and operated by a group 
of construction contractors. He is in jail in lieu of $1-million bail. 
</P>
<P>
Alfred and Haskell are free on $75,000 and $50,000 bail, respectively.

JESSE JACKSON ON BLACK VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Jesse Jackson's Column Left, "When Blacks Kill Blacks, There's 
Silence" (Commentary, Dec. 16): 
</P>
<P>
Jackson's observation that too much killing is going on is right on target; he 
misses the mark, though, when he starts in with the racist harangue. Guns of 
all description are equally available to all comers in our society and in 
direct proportion to the law of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
The apparent fact that black people are using them in greater numbers than 
white people says more about the effect of his excuse-making and blame-laying 
than the guns themselves. 
</P>
<P>
If he wants to effect real change among his constituents, he should return to 
his early- and mid-'60s rhetoric whereby he encouraged the disadvantaged to 
personally work to improve their lot in life and not rely on government or 
anyone else to do it for them. If he would join me in promoting swift and 
certain punishment for criminal conduct, instead of blaming rich, white 
justice, we would see a decreasing prison population and a more affluent and 
productive general population.

U.S. RULING ON SCHOLARSHIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
William Raspberry raises many points in his commentary "A Suspicious Bolt From 
the Blue," (Commentary, Dec. 18) most of which are fallacious and typify the 
racist attitudes of the minority. 
</P>
<P>
To insinuate that the recent, now improperly amended, ruling regarding 
prohibitions against racially based scholarships came "out of the blue" is 
ludicrous. 
</P>
<P>
It was merely the consistent and proper application of federal law regarding 
the impropriety of programs that discriminate on the basis of race. 
</P>
<P>
Further, to intimate that no one had been asking why such scholarships have 
been allowed to date is equally fallacious. Most thinking people, including 
blacks, have complained about and demanded an end of discrimination under the 
misnomer of "affirmative action" for many years. 
</P>
<P>
To label Michael L. Williams' interpretation of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as 
"novel" is the epitome of buffoonery. His interpretation was exactly correct, 
proper and in compliance with the law. Moreover, had the tables been turned, 
the minority would have demanded that Williams' interpretation be adopted 
posthaste. 
</P>
<P>
A fatal defect in Raspberry's logic is that the government is somehow 
responsible for equality of outcome. Nothing could be more preposterous. The 
government's responsibility is properly limited to ensuring equality of 
opportunity with the outcome allowed to be what ever it turns out to be.

SOBRIETY CHECKPOINT FOR NEW YEAR'S EVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police announced Thursday that they will establish a sobriety 
checkpoint somewhere in the city New Year's Eve but won't say where until two 
hours before it opens. 
</P>
<P>
A state law enacted last Jan. 1 lowered the legal blood alcohol level for 
drivers from .10% to .08%, a move that has led to a 16% statewide increase in 
arrests and a 10% increase in convictions for the first 10 months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
Between October, 1989, and September, 1990, San Diego police said, 8,238 people 
were arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol, a 9% 
increase over the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
From Dec. 21 to Christmas Day this year, 96 people were arrested in San Diego 
on suspicion of driving with alcohol or drugs in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
Motorists who approach the sobriety checkpoint on New Year's Eve -- Monday 
night -- starting at about 9 o'clock, will be greeted by an officer who will 
hand out a pamphlet on the hazards of drunk drinking and ask drivers if they 
have been drinking. 
</P>
<P>
Based on what the officer observes of the driver's condition or speech, the 
driver might be pulled over for further tests, according to Sgt. Ralph Priem. 
</P>
<P>
Drivers will be given several sobriety tests, such as touching the nose or 
standing on one foot. If an officer determines that the driver is somehow 
impaired, he or she will be given a choice of a Breathalyzer test, blood test 
or urine test. 
</P>
<P>
A driver who takes a Breathalyzer will either be released or arrested, 
depending on what the test shows. A driver who chooses a blood or urine test, 
which takes longer to process, will be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
Because of recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings, police agencies must provide 
alternate routes around the sobriety checkpoint, and cannot keep motorists at a 
checkpoint for more than three minutes without pulling them over for further 
tests. The high court also ruled that a law enforcement agency must make public 
the sobriety checkpoint location. 
</P>
<P>
Upon arrest, a motorist loses his driver's license, is given a temporary 
operating permit for 45 days, and within 10 days must ask the state Department 
of Motor Vehicles for a hearing to get it back. First-offense drunk drivers can 
lose their licenses for four to six months. Second-offense drunk drivers can 
lose their licenses for up to a year.

PURSE-SNATCHING SUSPECT ARRESTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
San Diego police have arrested a man suspected of attempting to rob a 77-year 
old Rancho Bernardo woman in a shopping center parking lot earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
Felipe Vallejo-Carachure 18, of the 2800 block of K Street was arrested 
Wednesday after he came voluntarily into the northeast area station for 
questioning, Lt. Richard Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
A second suspect is being sought in the attempted robbery, which occurred in 
the parking lot of Bernardo Plaza on Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Bertha Ridderhof of Rancho Bernardo was returning to her car about 9 p.m. As 
she placed a package on the roof of her car, a man grabbed her purse. She held 
onto the purse and was dragged to the ground. Onlookers saw the struggle and 
came to her aid, Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
Ridderhof sustained facial and head injuries and was taken to Sharp Memorial 
Hospital where she was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
The assailant escaped in a car driven by another man, who police are still 
seeking, Bennett said.

GRACE KLAUBER DIES AT 106 AFTER LIFE OF CIVIC SERVICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY RATHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Two days after celebrating her 106th birthday, Grace Gould Klauber, a longtime 
community service volunteer, died Thursday at UCSD Medical Center after a brief 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber proffered her leadership and service to the many social, civic and 
cultural organizations she was a part of throughout her life. 
</P>
<P>
Born on Christmas Day, 1884, in Chicago, Mrs. Klauber moved to San Diego with 
her family in 1899. She attended Russ High School, which is now San Diego High, 
and was president of the class of 1903. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber married her classmate, Laurence M. Klauber, in 1911. Laurence 
Klauber went on to become chairman and CEO of San Diego Gas &amp; Electric. He 
published works on reptiles, and was the Natural History Museum's first curator 
of reptiles and amphibians. He died in 1968 at 84. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber was active in many community organizations and was honored by the 
Salvation Army, which named her a "Woman of Distinction" in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
She had been a member of the Wednesday Club since 1923. She was a longtime 
campaigner for the San Diego Community Chest, now the United Way of San Diego 
County, of which her brother, E.B. Gould, was the founding president in 1920. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber was a member of ZLAC Rowing Club since 1904 and was its president 
in 1927-28. In 1982, she was the honorary chairwoman of the San Diego Crew 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
A longtime board member of the Boys &amp; Girls Aid Society, now the Boys &amp; 
Girls Mental Health Centers, Mrs. Klauber served as president from 1935-37. She 
was also president of the House of Hospitality Assn. in Balboa Park from 
1957-58 and remained active in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber was an avid gardener and worked in her gardens daily until she was 
in her late 90s. She drove her own car until she was 101 and ran her household 
alone until she was 102. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. and Mrs. Klauber were longtime concert-goers and enthusiasts of classical 
music. She served on the board of the San Diego Symphony Orchestra when it was 
re-established in 1949 after a shutdown during World War II. For many years she 
was a director of the San Diego Women's Committee for the Los Angeles 
Philharmonic and was a co-founder and vice president of the San Diego Opera 
Guild in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber had lived in the family home since 1927 and entertained often 
there. She celebrated her 105th birthday there with a large group of friends 
last December. 
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Klauber is survived by her children, Alice K. Miller and Philip M. Klauber 
of San Diego, and seven grandchildren: Dr. Laurence A. Miller of Los Angeles 
and Grace Miller Valencia, David Miller Jr., Jeffrey Conyers, Timothy Klauber, 
Janet K. Oliver and Laurie K. Wasserman, of San Diego; and two 
great-grandchildren, of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Following Mrs. Klauber's wishes, there will be no services. Merkley-Mitchell 
Mortuary is in charge. 
</P>
<P>
The family asks that donations be sent to the Wednesday Club, the San Diego 
Natural History Museum or to a favorite charity.

ARIZONA FINALLY PUTS PEPPERDINE AWAY;

<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: WAVES TRAIL BY ONLY 32-29 AT HALFTIME BEFORE LOSING TO 
NATION'S FOURTH-RANKED TEAM, 80-66.

<P>
Fourth-ranked Arizona had more talent, height and experience, but Pepperdine 
had more determination Thursday night -- at least for much of the game. 
</P>
<P>
But Arizona's tall, talented and veteran front line eventually wore down the 
Waves, and the Wildcats won, 80-66, in the Fiesta Bowl tournament before 13,879 
at McKale Center. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves (6-5) might not have deserved to have been in the same arena with 
Arizona (9-1), but they didn't seem to know it in the first half and part of 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine not only stayed with Arizona, but stayed ahead for nearly six 
minutes of the first half. The Waves led, 21-17, with 9:10 remaining in the 
half. But Arizona led, 32-29, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Waves trailed, 52-50, with 10:24 to play. But Pepperdine's inside players 
began to foul out. Arizona began going inside more to Sean Rooks and Brian 
Williams, and the Wildcats began pulling away. 
</P>
<P>
With Rooks and Williams operating freely inside, Arizona opened its lead to 
80-62 -- its biggest of the game -- before giving up two meaningless Pepperdine 
baskets at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
Rooks scored a game-high 26 points and had a game-high 11 rebounds. Williams, 
who played sparingly in the first half because of foul trouble, finished with 
14 points and six rebounds in 23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Two Pepperdine starters, forward Geoff Lear and center Derek Noether, and 
reserve center Rex Manu eventually fouled out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"Our big guys need to figure out a way to stay in the ballgame," Pepperdine 
Coach Tom Asbury said. "We can't have guys foul out to beat this team." 
</P>
<P>
Doug Christie led the Waves with 20 points and Lear added 15 points before he 
fouled out with 4:05 left. 
</P>
<P>
Asbury was asked if he was impressed by his team's effort. 
</P>
<P>
"If you mean was it a moral victory, no. I can't buy it. If we are going to 
play, we are going to play to win. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't expect to foul out three big men and stay in the game. Our big guys 
need to figure out a way to stay in the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
Arizona Coach Lute Olson, however, was impressed by Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
"There is no question that they played harder than what we did in the first 
half at least," Olson said. "They outscrapped and outhustled us. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of credit for this one has to go to Pepperdine. They really came in and 
played hard and intelligently." 
</P>
<P>
Asbury said that Arizona was "smart at the end of the game. They did what they 
had to do: they took it inside and just kicked our rear end." 
</P>
<P>
Olson said he thought that the "difference for us in the second half was the 
defensive intensity. It made it harder for them to do what they wanted to do 
offensively. 
</P>
<P>
"(Matt) Muehlebach and (Khalid) Reeves did a great job for us -- Reeves did a 
fabulous defensive job. 
</P>
<P>
"The stretch that was the best for us was when we had Reeves, Muehlebach and 
(Wayne) Womack at the perimeter positions. I think the key to the run was the 
perimeter pressure we put on them." 
</P>
<P>
In the first game, center Victor Alexander scored a game-high 28 points, 
including five in overtime, leading Iowa State (3-9) to an 81-79 upset over 
Temple (4-3). 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed nine times in the second half as both teams went on a 
three-point shooting binge, with each making four in the first 12:20. 
</P>
<P>
Temple's All-American guard, Mark Macon, who finished with 26 points, missed 
three-pointattempts at the end of regulation play and at the end of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander added a game-high 12 rebounds. Iowa State guard Skip McCoy scored 17 
points, including four for six from three-point range. Pepperdine will play 
Temple and Arizona will play Iowa State on Saturday.

Ohio State, preparing for a difficult Big Ten Conference schedule that begins 
next week, almost was beaten by a Southern Mississippi team searching for 
respect. 
</P>
<P>
But the No. 6 Buckeyes came back from a three-point halftime deficit to defeat 
Southern Mississippi, 82-80, Thursday night in the opening round of the Palm 
Beach tournament at West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
"They've got a good ballclub and they did a good job of taking it to us," Ohio 
State Coach Randy Ayers said. "We needed another close game like this to get 
ready for our Big 10 season." 
</P>
<P>
Ohio State (9-0) will play Miami, Ohio, a 101-99 winner over Miami, Fla., 
tonight in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Unranked Mississippi State (7-1), which competes in the Southeastern 
Conference, pushed the Buckeyes throughout the game and led, 44-41, at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The lead changed five times after halftime before the Buckeyes went ahead, 
69-67, with 6:45 left. 
</P>
<P>
Jamaal Brown led Ohio State with 20 points and Jim Jackson had 18, including 
three baskets in the last four minutes.

NOTHING NEW AS EDDIE JOHNSON SPARKS SEATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Now that the East Coast has discovered firsthand that the Portland Trail 
Blazers are an outstanding team, they are learning there is another pretty good 
team in the Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
Eddie Johnson came off the bench to score 18 of his 22 points in the first half 
Thursday night at Landover, Md., to help the Seattle SuperSonics beat the 
Washington Bullets, 125-120. 
</P>
<P>
Only 2,413 braved a snowstorm to see the SuperSonics win their sixth in a row. 
About the only thing they had to cheer about were Bernard King's 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
When the SuperSonics obtained Johnson in the trade that sent Xavier McDaniel to 
the Phoenix Suns, they were 5-11. The main reason Seattle made the deal was to 
find a place in the lineup for inexperienced Shawn Kemp. The 6-foot-10 forward, 
who never played in college, averaged 15 minutes as a rookie last season. 
</P>
<P>
Kemp became a regular about the time sharpshooting guard Dale Ellis recovered 
from injury. With Johnson coming off the bench to provide instant offense, the 
SuperSonics (12-13) have been on a roll. Kemp, who turned 21 last month, had 20 
points and 12 rebounds. He was instrumental in helping the SuperSonics build a 
71-55 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson scored his 22 points in 19 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm accustomed to the role," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
Portland 105, Charlotte 96 -- Clyde Drexler had 25 points as the Trail Blazers 
improved the NBA's best record to 26-3. 
</P>
<P>
Jerome Kersey had 21 points and 10 rebounds at Charlotte as the Trail Blazers 
handed the Hornets their 11th consecutive defeat. Portland is 11-2 on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Rex Chapman had six points in a 9-0 run that cut Portland's lead to 59-57 in 
the third quarter and the Hornets led, 72-71, in the fourth, but Portland's 
experience prevailed in the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
The Hornets were without playmaker Muggsy Bogues, who has a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
"There's a lot of hard work that has led to this great start," Drexler said. 
"We were not at our best and we still won. That's a compliment to this team." 
</P>
<P>
Chicago 128, Golden State 113 -- Michael Jordan made certain that the Bulls 
didn't suffer a let down after finally beating the Pistons Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
He scored a season-high 42 points at Chicago to lead the Bulls to their seventh 
victory in six games. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Scottie Pippen, who finished with 34 points, broke the game open in 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Bulls led, 64-50, at halftime. In the third quarter, Jordan was eight for 
11 and had 18 points; Pippen was five for seven and had 14. A 41-point fourth 
quarter stretched the lead to 105-65 and sent the Warriors to their fourth road 
loss in a row. 
</P>
<P>
Jordan also had 14 rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
Utah 110, Dallas 102 -- Karl Malone, who was married Tuesday, celebrated with 
35 points at Salt Lake City and the Jazz needed most of them. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Mavericks lost for the 10th time in their last 13 games, they 
battled all the way. Derek Harper led the Mavericks with 32 points and 11 
assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Jazz have won 10 of their last 13 and are two games out of first in the 
Midwest Division. 
</P>
<P>
Miami 124, Denver 114 -- Sherman Douglas had a career-high 42 points and the 
Heat won for the first time at Denver. 
</P>
<P>
The Nuggets led, 92-89, early in the fourth quarter, but Douglas led a 12-2 
spurt that put the Heat, 2-10 on the road, ahead to stay. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Adams led the Nuggets with 23 points and 11 assists. DAN HAFNER

First the Edmonton Oilers had to learn to win without Wayne Gretzky. When they 
did, they won the Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Then this season they had to learn to win without Jari Kurri and goaltender 
Grant Fuhr. As soon as Mark Messier was healthy, they did. 
</P>
<P>
But when Messier reinjured his knee, they had to learn to win without another 
all-star. 
</P>
<P>
They have used the powerful Calgary Flames to prove they can survive even the 
loss of Messier. 
</P>
<P>
With Bill Ranford performing brilliantly in goal again, the Oilers beat the 
Flames, 4-1, Thursday night at Edmonton. It was the second time in less than a 
week that the Oilers, without Messier, have beaten the leaders of the Smythe 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers scored two short-handed goals and two power-play goals while earning 
their 500th NHL victory. 
</P>
<P>
Ranford stopped 26 shots as the Oilers ended the Flames' nine-game unbeaten 
streak on the road. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who were off to a terrible start this season, have moved within 
three points of third-place Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
New York Islanders 1, New Jersey 1 -- It was an opportunity for the Devils to 
move into a tie for first place in the Patrick Division. 
</P>
<P>
In a tight defensive battle at East Rutherford, N.J., with the Islanders, a 
fluke cost them the victory that would have tied them with the New York 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
John MacLean scored his 26th goal on a power play in the first period and the 
Devils' goalie Chris Terreri seemed determined to make it hold up. 
</P>
<P>
Terreri stopped a shot by David Volek in the middle of the second period, but 
defenseman Ken Daneyko, while lying on the ice, tried to clear the puck and 
inadvertently hooked the puck into the net for the New York goal. 
</P>
<P>
Except for the one play, the Devils, unbeaten in their last six games (3-0-3), 
played well on defense. They killed seven penalties, three times when the 
Islanders had 5-3 advantages. 
</P>
<P>
The Devils, who had several scoring chances thwarted by goalie Glenn Healy, 
have 45 points, the Rangers 46. 
</P>
<P>
Toronto 6, St. Louis 4 -- It was a happy occasion in Toronto. Overcoming the 
38th goal by the Blues' Brett Hull, the Maple Leafs moved out of last place in 
the overall NHL standings. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs scored four goals in a row in a little more than five minutes 
after the league's leading goal scorer opened the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs, 6-4-1 in December, have an 11-26-2 record to move ahead of 
Quebec and move within four points of fourth-place Minnesota in the Norris 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
The Maple Leafs' surge will be worth it if they make the playoffs. But if they 
don't, they may miss out on drafting Eric Lindros, the probable first pick. 
</P>
<P>
The Leafs ended the Blues' nine-game unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
Montreal 7, Vancouver 5 -- Brian Skurdland had a goal and two assists in the 
first period at Vancouver as the Canadiens built a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Canucks rallied in the last two periods to cut the lead to one. 
</P>
<P>
The victory enabled the Canadiens to pull to within six points of Boston, 
leader of the Adams Division. DAN HAFNER

ORANGE HOLIDAY TOURNAMENT;

<P>
IT'S BOMBS AWAY FOR CAPISTRANO VALLEY IN VICTORY OVER KENNEDY 
</P>

<P>
Few teams in Orange County have taken advantage of the three-point shot more 
effectively than Capistrano Valley High School since the rule was incorporated 
in 1987-88. 
</P>
<P>
For the past three years, Capistrano Valley has been highly successful with 
former stars Scott McCorkle, Chris Kostoff, Bill Mazurie and Charles Lockard 
consistently hitting the three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Capistrano Valey once again rode the wave of some fine 
three-point shooting, making seven of 11 attempts in the first half and rolling 
to a 73-55 victory over Kennedy in the Orange Holiday Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Capistrano Valley (12-1) into tonight's semifinals, where it 
will meet San Francisco Riordan (8-2) at 6:50 in Chapman College's Hutton 
Sports Center. Mater Dei (7-3) will meet Santa Clara (12-2) in the other 
semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
Three of the four teams played in state championship games in Oakland last 
spring. Mater Dei beat Riordan in the Division I title game and Santa Clara was 
the Division IV champion. 
</P>
<P>
Riordan will have the imposing task of trying to contain guard Tom Airey, the 
latest in the line of top guns at Capistrano Valley. Airey scored 26 points 
against Kennedy, hitting six three-pointers against a soft Kennedy defense. 
</P>
<P>
Airey made three consecutive three-pointers in the second quarter when 
Capistrano Valley opened a 40-25 lead, and the Cougars weren't threatened the 
rest of the way. Center Brett McCorkle also showed he can hit three-pointers, 
making a pair in the second quarter. Capistrano Valley made 9 of 13 field goals 
in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This line has changed the game so much in the past four years that you've got 
to take advantage of it," said Mark Thornton, Capistrano Valley coach. "We 
start right off emphasizing the shot with our freshmen. Right now, we have 
three or four kids on the freshman team who can shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
Thornton said Capistrano Valley averages 42% as a team from three-point range 
with Airey, McCorkle and guard Dan Sedgwick given the green light to attempt 
the shot. Airey averages 50% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
Kennedy (3-6) did a poor job of defending Capistrano Valley's shooters, using a 
perimeter defense that's designed to contain outside shooters. 
</P>
<P>
The lone bright spot for Kennedy was the continued improvement of junior center 
Jermaine Galloway. Galloway had 23 points, nine rebounds and blocked three 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
Mater Dei 60, Orange 36 -- Forward Jason Janeski scored 19 points and center 
Terence Wilborn added 10 points as Mater Dei (8-3) won for the sixth time in 
its past seven games. Center Jamiel Wortheim had 15 points for Orange (6-4). 
</P>
<P>
In consolation play: 
</P>
<P>
Saddleback 72, Sammamish (Wash.) 67 -- Forward Jason Register scored 17 points 
and teammate David Washington added 14 for Saddleback. 
</P>
<P>
Fountain Valley 84, Facey Composite 37 -- Center Barrett Hoygan scored 20 
points and forward Adam Ziebarth added 16 for Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Laguna Beach 73, Orange Lutheran 70 -- Guard Josh Borrella, averaging 28 points 
per game, scored a season-high 37 for Laguna Beach (6-4).

BOYS' ROUNDUP; 
</P>
<P>
TOMKO SCORES 55 POINTS IN EL DORADO'S VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Brett Tomko scored 55 points, the third-highest total in Orange County history, 
in El Dorado High School's 86-83 overtime victory against Compton in a 
consolation game of the Brea-Olinda Tournament Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tomko, a 6-foot-4 senior forward who had never scored more than 24 points in a 
game and had a 17.2 average, scored 23 points in the fourth quarter to help El 
Dorado (5-5) rally from a 60-45 deficit. Tomko added seven points in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
Tomko's performance tied Mark Wulfemeyer, who scored 55 for Troy in 1974. 
Loara's Tes Whitlock scored 68 points Saturday to break the 80-year-old record 
of 58, set by Art Worthy of Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Tomko, who made 20 of 26 shots from the field and 15 of 17 free throws, broke 
the school record of 42 set in 1980 by Ken Botka. 
</P>
<P>
"Most of his shots were from inside the key," El Dorado Coach Wayne Carlson 
said. "They never shut him down at all. We just kept getting the ball to him." 
</P>

led, 53-48, after three quarters and were never challenged thereafter. Rob 
Johnson had 25 points, seven rebounds and six assists and Jeremy Hogue added 22

MONROVIA TAKES ADVANTAGE OF CANYON'S DEFENSE

<P>
Eighty-one points is usually enough to make Canyon High School Coach Steve 
Sabins happy. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately for Sabins and a ragged Comanche defense, Monrovia scored 91 
Thursday to bounce Canyon from the winners' bracket in the quarterfinals of the 
Canyon Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"If you would have told me before the game we'd score 81 points, I'd have told 
you we'd blow them out," Sabins said. "We scored well enough to win. We just 
didn't have it together on defense." 
</P>
<P>
Canyon's man-to-man defense is supposed to create turnovers, but Thursday it 
merely provided easy scoring opportunities for Monrovia. 
</P>
<P>
Monrovia (5-6) outscored Canyon, 27-12, in the second quarter and held on for 
the victory. Monrovia's Brett Moore led all scorers with 28 points and Kirby 
Gardner added 20. 
</P>
<P>
Eric Oliver kept the Comanches close with 27 points. But Kevin Wilborn, 
Canyon's leading scorer all season, picked up three fouls early and didn't 
score until 3:42 remained in the third quarter. Wilborn finished with 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
Tom Bottiaux scored 14 for the Comanches (6-4), and Abdi Barkhordar added 11. 
</P>
<P>
Canyon outscored Monrovia, 23-18, in the fourth quarter, but Iu Man kept the 
Comanches at bay with a pair of three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went our way tonight," Monrovia Coach Steve Hebert said. "We were 
lucky to catch Canyon on an off-night." 
</P>
<P>
In the consolation round: 
</P>
<P>
Vista 56, Anaheim 55 -- Rudy Fernandez scored 18 for Anaheim, but Vista's 
outside shooting proved too much. Chris Johnson (17 points) hit five 
three-pointers and Nils Michals (15 points) had three. 
</P>
<P>
Villa Park 67, Ridgecrest Burroughs 65 -- Aaron Boone scored 21 for Villa Park, 
which also got 12 points each from Matt Gibson, Dave Mansolino and Ryan 
McArthur. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana 84, Bolsa Grande 50 -- The Saints (6-4) jumped to a 22-5 lead after 
the first quarter and a 41-18 lead by halftime. Ramon Yerena paced Santa Ana 
with 26 points, followed by Chauncey Woolridge with 25. Bolsa Grande (2-5) was 
led by Sy Sayarath with 23 points.

Dees' Wanna-Bes 
</P>
<P>
Two businessmen in New York City watch ABC's "Into the Night Starring Rick 
Dees" just for the fashion show. Then they call up Beverly Hills retailer Sami 
Dinar, who outfits Dees for the show, two, sometimes even three times a week to 
order the same Canali suits and Marienbad ties they see on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
The men are notorious for their allegiance to Dees' style, which made Christmas 
shopping for them easy. Last week, friends and relatives called Dinar to order 
presents for the guys. 
</P>
<P>
TUX DELUXE: Been searching for an affordable version of those ruffled, 
Edwardian-style tuxedo shirts Prince wore in his Purple Rain videos? Listen 
just uncovered a stash of them, for the less-than-princely sum of $2 each, at 
Top Hat on South Broadway, downtown. There are men's and boy's sizes, with 
ruffles trimmed in blue, burgundy, green, yellow, fuchsia and, yes, even 
purple. 
</P>
<P>
DOUBLING THE PLEASURE: Carrie Fisher and Bridget Fonda are from the one-for-me 
and one-for-you school of shopping. They were spotted in Prada, a Beverly Hills 
boutique, where Fisher bought a handbag for her mom, Debbie Reynolds, as well 
as one for herself. Fonda shopped for her dad, Peter, picking out a black 
travel bag; she also bought a black cashmere shawl. 
</P>
<P>
CAMEO ROLE: While some guests were sampling the food at Diaghilev in the Bel 
Age hotel, others were staring at an elegant man in a pin-striped suit. Was it 
actor Raul Julia? It was, looking taller, thinner and more debonair than he did 
in "Havana."

STYLE: COLORFUL VESTS, TIES AND CUMMERBUNDS HELP MAKE THE MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
This party season, black tie optional has taken on new meaning. 
</P>
<P>
For men who want to stand out in a crowd at formal New Year's Eve galas, there 
are splashy bow ties, colorful cummerbunds and rich tapestry vests to liven up 
the traditional tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
"Gentlemen are looking for more extremes in furnishings," says Bjorn Sedleniek, 
owner of P.O.S.H. in Fashion Island, Newport Beach. "They don't just want to 
wear black, white or red bow ties. Those get kind of boring." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, they're choosing accessories in dynamic colors and patterns, including 
florals, paisleys and Art Deco-style prints. 
</P>
<P>
Colorful accessories allow men to get away from the formal tux uniform and show 
some individuality. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of our customers are very social. They may go to five events where 
they'll be seeing the same people," Sedleniek says. By adding a fresh 
furnishing, they can change their look without investing in a new tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
A slow economy has helped make tuxedo furnishings an attractive option for men, 
according to Tom Julian, associate fashion director for the Men's Fashion Assn. 
in New York City. Even if they can't afford a new tux, men can update their 
formal wear with unusual extras. 
</P>
<P>
"We're doing a nice job with the classic cutaway coat and even the opera capes 
and top hats," says Alan Anderson, sales representative for Alfred Dunhill of 
London Inc. in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. "That's the creme de la creme. 
Throw that in with a walking stick, and you're just about making the entry of 
all entries. It's shades of FDR." 
</P>
<P>
One customer ordered an ebony walking stick, white gloves and a black cape to 
wear with his tuxedo, according to Ray Caruso, manager of Alfred Dunhill. 
</P>
<P>
"He even went so far as to order the cape with a white silk lining" for a more 
dramatic effect, Caruso says. 
</P>
<P>
More conservative dressers experiment only with the cummerbund set and vests. 
</P>
<P>
"Men are wearing little beauties like these," says Caruso, unpacking a box of 
newly arrived vests made in rich woven tapestries. One elegant vest features 
Art Deco lilies against a pale lavender background, available for $425. 
</P>
<P>
"Vests are a great way to update a tux," Julian says. 
</P>
<P>
Vests with shawl collars that have geometric and floral prints inspired by the 
'30s and '40s have emerged as one of the season's hottest tux accessories. For 
a vest to look formal, however, the fabric must be lush. 
</P>
<P>
"The brocades are woven into the fabric instead of printed, so it has a 
richness that moves," Caruso says. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more traditional bow ties and cummerbunds have gone from basic black 
to loud prints in non-traditional gem colors such as teal and purple. 
</P>
<P>
Sedleniek ordered a gold brocade cummerbund set for New Year's after the first 
sets sold out weeks before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a departure from the gray and black," he says. 
</P>
<P>
If one insists on wearing white, P.O.S.H. has cummerbunds of silk Jacquard with 
a paisley print woven into the white fabric. Braver souls can choose something 
more progressive, such as a cummerbund set in pale yellow with large purple 
medallions or a burgundy-and-gray set with a geometric print. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of them get gaudy. We try to keep them in good taste," Sedleniek says. 
</P>
<P>
Braces, once limited to black and white for formal wear, come in all colors and 
designs. P.O.S.H. carries Art Deco-style suspenders with scenes of party-goers 
sipping champagne -- an appropriate choice for New Year's. Another set comes 
with art nouveau scenes of women bathing. 
</P>
<P>
Gary's &amp; Co. in Fashion Island has special limited edition braces with 
red-winged cherubs. 
</P>
<P>
"We always do a little novelty at New Year's, but we're doing more this year 
than in the past," says Rich Myklebust, merchandise manager for Gary's. "In our 
part of the country there aren't as many serious black-tie events as there are 
fun charity balls, so it's real appropriate to have fun with things like 
cummerbunds." 
</P>
<P>
For New Year's, Gary's has a burgundy silk cummerbund set embroidered with 
gloves, a tall hat and a walking stick for $135. 
</P>
<P>
While black onyx and mother-of-pearl stud sets still carry the day, Gary's has 
found antique stud sets are back in vogue. One full dress set, dating from the 
1930s, features silver-plated studs with tiny pearls and gray mother-of-pearl. 
It's available for $325. 
</P>
<P>
"What's new is old," says Myklebust. "Antique cuff links are the tastiest 
things guys are doing now." 
</P>
<P>
Most men are still wearing a traditional white tuxedo shirt with straight or 
wing collars, but some opt for shirts with bib fronts that have a 
white-on-white Jacquard pattern or fine ticking stripes. 
</P>
<P>
"It's real subtle," Myklebust says. 
</P>
<P>
While they may plan their formal wear down to the finest detail, men often 
overlook their feet. 
</P>
<P>
"So many make the mistake of slipping on a pair of business shoes with their 
tuxedos," Julian says. He favors the classic pump in black suede. 
</P>
<P>
Tuxedos mainly serve as the plain black backdrop to all of this flash, but they 
have loosened up since the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not as tight or stiff as they used to be," Julian says. He predicts 
jackets with shawl collars to be the style for the '90s. A few designers are 
adding velvet collars, quilting and other Edwardian touches. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday parties provide the perfect opportunity to don more festive tuxedo 
jackets, Julian says. P.O.S.H. carries a black velvet dinner jacket with a 
shawl collar, or a black-and-gray paisley smoking jacket.

"It's a great holiday look for men who want a change of pace," Sedleniek says.

HOT TO SHOP: MAKE A BOLD RESOLUTION: NO BUYING ON IMPULSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER and JEANNINE STEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
It's the time to make New Year's resolutions, and even veteran shoppers like us 
could use some improvement. Here are our 1991 resolutions for less pig-headed, 
cranky and calorie-filled shopping trips: 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to only buy what we can't possibly live without and looks 
fantastic on us. We will ignore our mother's voice echoing, "But those sensible 
beige mid-heel pumps are only $10!" and realize that nothing is a bargain if 
you never wear it. We swear we'll never buy another thing on impulse again; it 
has to call our name and cry out to us to take it home. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve never, ever to say what we'd really like to say to the 39th 
salesclerk of the day who asks us: "Hi! How are you doing?" We'll refrain from 
exploding: "'We were doing just fine until 512 salesclerks inquired about the 
state of our mental health in the space of the last two hours." Rather, we'll 
calmly explain to their employers, "Stop instructing your sales staff to act 
like trained seals! Let your sales associates know that there are many, many 
ways to greet customers without sounding and looking like smiling robots. Use 
some discretion. If people look as if they want help, help them. If they look 
as if they want to be left alone, stay out of their faces." 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to eat before we shop, or plot other strategies that enable us to 
avoid the cholesterol courts at our favorite malls. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve not to buy anything (especially swimsuits, which are not always 
returnable) when we use shopping as an antidote to depression. While shopping 
provides a great temporary lift, we've noticed that things we buy when we don't 
feel great look like they belong in Lisa Bonet's wardrobe as soon as we get 
them home. Of course, we'll still shop when we feel down -- we just won't bring 
any money, checks or credit cards with us. 
</P>
<P>
* Conversely, we resolve to shop when we're already feeling great. It's amazing 
how being in a good mood when we start out affects whether we go home with 
gorgeous, perfect-fitting bargains . . . or Marge Simpson rejects. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to be better customers, to thank salesclerks when they do a good 
job and to call or write the store manager when they do an exceptional one. If 
a clerk is harried because the store is understaffed, we won't channel our 
anger and hostility toward him or her; it's the manager's job to have adequate 
help. And should we be treated unfairly by a salesperson, we will let the 
manager know right away that if the store doesn't want our money, we'll take it 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to be a more environmentally conscious shoppers. As much as we 
love collecting shopping bags, we realize that there are trees out there that 
deserve to live. A friend of ours found this enormous screaming yellow tote bag 
(pictured) at the new Ikea store in Burbank for a mere $2.50 that will carry a 
multitude of purchases. Even the most fervent shopper will be hard-pressed to 
fill it to capacity. We also resolve to let companies know when they are guilty 
of over-packaging their products; you know, a box inside a box inside a box, 
wrapped in plastic and then another box. Enough's enough. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve not to force friends and family into accompanying us on shopping 
trips. No longer will we drag cranky toddlers, surly boyfriends, bored husbands 
or impatient siblings on our buying treks. If it means shopping alone, so be 
it. It's a dirty job, but someone has to do it. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to abstain from shop-till-you-drop marathons unless they are 
absolutely necessary. Instead, we'll shop more frequently for shorter 
durations. Too much shopping is like eating three corn-dogs-on-a-stick followed 
by a Mrs. Fields' chaser; the memory lingers far too long. 
</P>
<P>
* We resolve to rid our closets of those tired pouf skirts and give away other 
un-needed items to friends or charity more frequently. That way we'll reap more 
pleasure and suffer less guilt when updating our wardrobes.

NEW MASTER STORYTELLER COMMENCES HER REIGN; 
</P>
<P>
THE STORIES OF EVA LUNA BY ISABEL ALLENDE TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH BY MARGARET 
SAYERS PEDEN. ATHENEUM, $18.95, 288 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELAINE KENDALL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Never mind the Grand Vizier, the heartless king and all the unfortunate virgins 
who preceded Scheherazade. In all essential respects, the narrator of Isabel 
Allende's "The Stories of Eva Luna" is the reincarnation of that marvelous 
storyteller, as the epigraph from "A Thousand and One Nights" suggests. 
</P>
<P>
Readers of Isabel Allende's memorable earlier novel, "Eva Luna," will recognize 
her at once: the peasant girl from the hinterlands of a generic South American 
country who becomes a self-taught "seller of words." By the end of that novel, 
Eva Luna had achieved fame, joy and an adoring, if temperamental, lover in Rolf 
Carle. 
</P>
<P>
In the brief prologue to the new "Stories," Carle asks Eva for a story, and she 
obliges with 23 enthralling tales in which folkloric themes are enhanced by a 
cosmopolitan, contemporary sensibility. 
</P>
<P>
The result is arresting and altogether distinctive, powerful and haunting; a 
collection of stories to be read aloud, memorized and repeated for generations. 
In common with other writers from countries colonized by Europeans, Allende's 
language recalls the rhythm of earlier centuries without being in the least 
archaic. 
</P>
<P>
As in traditional legend, the characters are larger than life -- embodiments of 
passion, cruelty and virtue. Look elsewhere for failing relationships, 
uncommitted lovers, jaded sophisticates and adolescents in search of 
themselves. Allende's people know exactly who they are and what they must do to 
survive. 
</P>
<P>
The first story, "Two Words," sets the mood. Belisa Crepusculario has 
christened herself for "beauty" and "twilight," having come from a family "so 
poor they did not even have names to give their children." 
</P>
<P>
Stronger and more resourceful than her doomed brothers and sisters, Belisa sets 
out across her country's arid plains toward the sea. Along the way, she learns 
to read and write, earning a pittance as a storyteller, letter-writer and 
itinerant chronicler of village events. 
</P>
<P>
Her reputation eventually reaches the ruling tyrant, who wants to become the 
legally elected president. He orders his brigands to kidnap Belisa and bring 
her to the camp to create his campaign speeches . . . and the rest of that 
story should only be told by firelight, to a rapt audience. 
</P>
<P>
"Wicked Girl" is a tale of unrequited love in which an awkward 11-year-old girl 
becomes obsessed with the wandering minstrel who rents a room in her mother's 
boarding house. 
</P>
<P>
For several weeks, Elena was "repelled by the brilliantine-slick hair, the 
polished nails, the excessive zeal with a toothpick, the pedantry, the brazen 
assumption they all would serve him." 
</P>
<P>
Repulsion turns to adoration, however, and the child lies down beside the man 
while he's napping, only to be thrown to the floor when he awakens and realizes 
he's mistaken her for her mother. Seven years in a convent erase Elena's memory 
of the incident but only intensify the man's. 
</P>
<P>
He has married the mother but lives in the grip of desire for the girl, who now 
stares at him speechlessly, unable to "remember any particular Thursday in her 
past." 
</P>
<P>
Several of the stories take place in the fictional town of Agua Santa, an 
impoverished, isolated settlement that forms the perfect milieu for these 
modern legends: large enough to contain a full complement of human 
eccentricity; small enough so that every event is visible to the entire 
population. 
</P>
<P>
The unofficial mayor is Riad Halabi, a Middle Eastern peddler who settled 
there, prospered, and has been showing his gratitude ever since. Halabi 
reappears from time to time, functioning as catalyst, philanthropist and 
conscience. 
</P>
<P>
Socially and economically, the town is typical of many benighted places in this 
country of extremes, but what other village has both a secular saint and a 
myth-maker? 
</P>
<P>
There is violence in these stories -- revenge, madness, death, lust and greed 
-- but also compassion, vitality, humor, tenderness and generosity, and all in 
exquisite balance and proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Superbly translated from the Spanish, the language creates an aura of mystery 
and wonder even in the tales clearly based on actual events and firmly rooted 
in the present. 
</P>
<P>
If Allende's life, like Scheherazade's, actually depended on her narrative 
gifts, she'd not only survive, but reign. 
</P>

NEA Update: The National Endowment for the Arts confirmed a $12.9-million cut 
in arts funding with the official release of its $174-million 1991 budget on 
Thursday. The cuts, required under a new congressional mandate to allocate more 
federal funds to state arts agencies, will be made in virtually all arts 
categories. According to a spokeswoman for the arts agency, the size of each 
grant -- not the number of grantees -- will be targeted for reduction as a 
result of the cutbacks. BETH KLEID

I Wanna Be a Mermaid: British actress Emily Lloyd sued Orion Pictures Corp. for 
more than $5 million on Wednesday, claiming she was promised the role in the 
film "Mermaids" that went to Winona Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
Lloyd, 20, contends that in January, 1989, her agent reached an oral agreement 
with Orion that she would play Cher's daughter in the film. An Orion agent then 
sent Lloyd a letter outlining the terms of the contract, Lloyd's attorney said. 
In May, however, Lloyd learned she would not be playing the Charlotte Flax 
character in the movie. BETH KLEID

DALE'S: A NEW FRENCH REVOLUTION IN WEST HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELLE HUNEVEN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For those West Hollywood folk who want a friendly, unpretentious, imaginative 
little bistro at their disposal, Dale's Bistro may be a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
It's a storefront restaurant, actually two small storefronts, merged and 
updated with enough Post-Modern architectural flourishes -- a linoleum floor 
that looks like textured sheet metal, a green marbleized column, some swoops 
and curves in the plasterwork -- to put us firmly in the 1990s. There is also 
decent Abstract Expressionism on the walls; cheerful French music, and enough 
bistro paraphernalia -- a propeller fan; small, dark bentwood chairs; dark wood 
wainscotting, and a potted palm -- to set us firmly in casual, nostalgic 
Francophilia. 
</P>
<P>
But don't get too comfy envisioning the dark, comfortable anachronisms of Left 
Bank nostalgia cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight's menu, Dale's Beast Row, reveals a playful scuffle between 
contemporary California cooking and old-style French American Bistro. A Caesar 
salad is reinforced with radicchio and endive. Les escargots are wrapped in won 
tons. The steak Diane snags a Jack Daniels sauce. And a classic onion soup 
winds up with three cheeses -- one of them, we are told, is goat. 
</P>
<P>
Other old French American cliches are similarly exploded: There are no rude 
waiters, no temperamental chef. Our waitress is a sweet-tempered young woman 
and Dale Payne himself ambles around the dining room chatting with customers 
and pouring coffee and dashing back to the kitchen with precision timing to 
finish orders. 
</P>
<P>
The thing is, Payne can afford to reinvent the snail, fraternize with the 
customers, put crayons and butcher paper on his tables, enjoy himself on the 
job and otherwise push and bend all the so-called rules of restaurant 
management. Because when it comes right down to it, the man can cook. 
</P>
<P>
He has, in fact, cooked in good restaurants all over town -- Michael's, Spago, 
Bistango, Les Anges. And so, a soft, creamy, perfectly grilled cake of polenta 
comes with sharp-tasting shards of olives and roasted peppers and a lively 
buttermilk pesto sauce. The fried calamari has a delightfully spiced breading 
and a peppery, sinus-clearing rouille. Both the Caesar and the mixed baby green 
salad are fresh and well-dressed. A chicken gumbo soup is earthy and spicy and 
totally satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
Entrees come with generous portions of wild rice pilaf and ratatouille, both of 
which fill the plate but don't particularly excite the palate. The grilled 
shrimp were plump and so fresh they made you want to sing sea chanteys; 
unfortunately, the curry sauce they were served with was vague and 
uninteresting. A roast lamb with mole was a noble experiment; the classic 
southern Mexican pepper-chocolate sauce tended to bring out all the raucous 
gaminess of the lamb, and it might have better pleased those whose tastes run 
wilder than mine. 
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, all the other entrees I tasted were superb. My personal favorite was 
the chicken roasted with Provencal herbs and served with a grainy mustard 
sauce. The meat was juicy, the sauce was sassy without being overpowering. Also 
lovely was a pork loin with red onion confit; the meat was cooked so well it 
provided the satisfying succulence found in good veal -- without exacting any 
veal-eating guilt. 
</P>
<P>
It's tough, after two courses at Dale's, to have room for dessert. We did 
manage a slice of decent apple tarte tatin one night, but for the most part 
were happy ending up with a cup of delicious decaf and the opportunity to 
finish the crayon drawings begun before dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Dale's Bistro, 361 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood, (213) 659-3996. Open 
for lunch Tuesday-Friday 11:30 a.m.-2 p.m. Open for dinner Tuesday-Saturday 
6-10:30 p.m. Beer and wine. Parking in rear. Dinner for two, food only, 
$30-$50.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: STRINGFELLOWS -- A GROOVY L.A.ER? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At 10:15 p.m., Peter Stringfellow takes the stage. The Stringfellows logo 
blazes pink neon behind him; pink light filters down from above. He's tan and 
fit, his blond hair in a modified Rod Stewart cut. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to welcome you all to my restaurant-slash-nightclub," the P.A. booms. 
"In just a little while a lot of groovy L.A.ers are going to join us. I hope. . 
. ." He clasps his hands together in mock-prayer and tilts his head upward 
toward the ceiling's pink glow. On weekends, huge lines of anxious people hope 
to get past the velvet ropes and into the club, the newest link in 
Stringfellow's international nightclub chain. But on this weeknight things are, 
well, quieter. You imagine Stringfellow is thinking about the rent he has to 
pay on this place in the Disneylandish Two Rodeo complex. Beverly Hills . . . 
Rodeo Drive . . . $$$$$. Disco music booms. Milton Berle, at the center table, 
winces. 
</P>
<P>
At Stringfellows, what passes for elegance is less the Hollywood club look than 
the Hollywood wives look. Enhanced cleavage is in. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, as you picked at, say, your "Stringfellows all-white salad" (curly 
endive, fennel, onion, white asparagus) with its black-pepper vinaigrette, a 
screen slowly descended ("A video!" a waiter explains to a perplexed couple) 
and revealed . . . the tuxedoed pianist playing dinner music five feet away 
from you. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the food is very good. The executive chef, Margaret Fischlein, in her 
earliest 20s, worked at Campanile before joining Stringfellow. She makes things 
like good sweetbread and potato lasagna and grilled squab with a lentil salad 
and grilled polenta. Her braised rabbit comes with orzo (rice pasta) cakes, 
which are a neat play on potato pancakes. Her sauteed John Dory comes on a bed 
of lightly truffled mashed potatoes, a trick she picked up from Campanile. 
</P>
<P>
Service is about what you'd expect at a place like this: fawning, yet somehow 
inept. 
</P>
<P>
 Stringfellows, Two Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills; (213) 285-9909. Entrees 
$20.95-$28.95.

STAGE BEAT: LEVIN'S 'ROOM' OPENS DOOR TO TERROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Playwright-novelist Ira Levin knows an intriguing idea when it hits him -- 
"Deathtrap" and "Rosemary's Baby" are good examples -- and his 1973 thriller 
"Veronica's Room" is just as intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
A young woman is drawn to a dark house near Boston to masquerade as her 
look-alike who died four decades earlier, and soon finds her hosts trying to 
convince her that she actually is Veronica, and the year is 1935, not 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Only a couple of flaws tarnish this well-polished, darkly-shaded production at 
the Richard Basehart Playhouse in Woodland Hills. Cynthia Baer's direction 
tempers the scenes to the double time element in the play with a sure hand, 
measuring the tempos of each era with perfection, but some of the moments as 
the net of terror begins to close in on the heroine could be tighter -- her 
fright is not ours at those times. 
</P>
<P>
The other flaw is the performance of Casey Van Patten as the woman's new 
boyfriend, who guides her into the trap and then becomes something completely 
different. There is a difference between playing wooden and being wooden; 
Patten opts for the latter. 
</P>
<P>
Kathleen McMartin is superior as the terrified victim, and the impeccable 
performances of Margaret Muse and Joe Conley as her chameleon captors create 
the sense of terrifying doom that dominates Levin's script. 
</P>
<P>
Ben Slack's set and Dana Kilgore's lighting couldn't be more on target as a 
frame for the fright. 
</P>
<P>
"Veronica's Room," Richard Basehart Playhouse, 21028-B Victory Blvd., Woodland 
Hills. Today-Saturday, 8 p.m.; Sunday, 2 p.m. Ends Sunday. $15; (818) 704-1845. 
Running time: 1 hour, 45 minutes.

'Off the Wall' Is on the Mark in Hollywood 
</P>
<P>
In any improv situation, some material works, some doesn't, according to the 
quality of audience suggestions. That a lot of the sketches bouncing "Off the 
Wall" at the Improv in Hollywood do work -- in spite of some inane prompts from 
the audience -- says something for the 15 years this group has been around. 
</P>
<P>
Two of the founding members, Wendy Cutler and Andy Goldberg shine throughout; 
Cutler especially in improvised song, and Goldberg particularly for his tasty 
sense of humor and the indefatigable quickness of his mind. Goldberg also 
directs the group with the same sharpness and dispatch. 
</P>
<P>
A total joy on the night seen was a company member subbing for a missing 
regular. Ron Gist, as large in talent as in girth, got as many laughs from his 
decisive characterizations and his reaction as he did from his razor-edged 
lines, notably as "Bubba," a college football center enrolled in a class on 
"How to Flirt." He is a wonder, and only one of the many reasons "Off the Wall" 
remains one of the best improv groups in town.

Revue Gives Its Regards to Broadway 
</P>
<P>
"Broadway Sings Out," at the West End Playhouse in Van Nuys, is a 
decade-spanning musical revue that tries to show how, down through the years, 
Broadway has also spoken out on social and political problems. As a revue it 
makes a jim-dandy candy-box of songs remembered and forgotten from Broadway 
shows in the past eight decades. Its message is slight, due to the sketchiness 
of its book and strained transitions (the show was "devised" by Ray Malvani). 
</P>
<P>
Anytime you pull together this much material in one evening, the tendency is 
for the best songs to put special spotlights on their interpreters. That's 
exactly what happens here. Danny Bolero's "Brother Can You Spare a Dime?" and 
other tunes are memorable because he is as good an actor as he is a singer. The 
burnished copper tone of Debra Moreno's strong voice makes standouts of several 
numbers. And Yvette Cason almost stops the show with her molten rendition of 
"Nobody." The whole company is in grand voice throughout this musical-theater 
encyclopedia.

"Broadway Sings Out," West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys;

Uneven One-Acts at Burbage Theatre 
</P>
<P>
The highlight of Program C in West Los Angeles' Burbage Theatre four-evening 
panoply of one-acts called "Shorts," is a taut little slice of life about two 
whites on a subway unavoidably involved in a conversation with a voluble black 
man. In James Serpento's "On the El Nighttimes," under Francine Markow's crisp, 
fully detailed direction, the playwright fairly romps through what amounts to a 
tone poem on prejudice, both direct and reverse. Is the black man really 
threatening, or just having his ironic way with the two muddled suburbanites? 
Cooper Bates never tips his hand in a delicious performance as the black man, 
and Ed Levey and Jack Harrell provide full counterpoint as his alleged innocent 
victims. 
</P>
<P>
Robin Fulford's "Dark Song" doesn't deserve the lucid, interesting direction 
with which Frederick Johntz has staged it. It's just another rape story, which 
doesn't provide new insight into this most demeaning of personal crimes. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor Gilbert is good as the victim, as is Ian Gregory as the building 
superintendent who attacks her, but we've heard the story before. 
</P>
<P>
Andy Griggs' direction keeps a fine pace going in Joel Murray's "There," a sort 
of schizoid paean to the lengths actors will travel for their art. The play is 
much too long for its own good and for what it has to say, but Cameron Watson 
is funny as the young actor willing to do anything, and Tom Waldman even finds 
humor in the sadness of his roommate, too wrapped up in finding a "method" to 
find himself. 
</P>
<P>
Both one-acts in Program D of "Shorts," amount to little more than one-joke 
items, but in both cases the writing is clever and the opener at least gives 
the work its best shot. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Korn is funny and properly naive as an inexperienced young playwright 
trying to sell his script to a dubious director in Willie Holtzman's "White 
Trash." Under Andy Griggs' direction the characters who inhabit the bar where 
the playwright works as bartender only fitfully come up to their peripheral 
roles in the play's gag -- as stereotypes from the work of famous writers. 
Alison McHale and Frederick Johntz come off best, recreating the worlds of 
Tennessee Williams and Sam Shepard, along with Mick Collins who spouts fine 
Clifford Odets urban cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
Collins' direction of David Kranes' "Keats' Ghost" gives it color, but suffers 
from the overplaying of Bill Frenzer as a theatrical agent named Keats who is 
inhabited by the ghost of poet John Keats. Jokes make television sketches, not 
plays. 
</P>
<P>
'Shorts (Programs C and D)," Burbage Theatre, 2330 Sawtelle Blvd., West Los 
Angeles; Thursdays-Saturdays, 8:30 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Call for repertory 
schedule. Ends Jan. 27. $15 (all four evenings, $40); (213) 478-0897. Running

HOME TECH LASER BIN: THREE BY KUROSAWA: THE VISION IS PURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By BARBARA SALTZMAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The Hidden Fortress" (Criterion Collection/Janus Films-Voyager Press, 139 
minutes, black-and-white, three CAV regular play discs in Japanese with English 
subtitles, wide-screen format, stereo sound). 
</P>
<P>
"Ran" (CBS-Fox, 160 minutes, color, one CLV extended play disc in Japanese with 
English subtitles, stereo sound). 
</P>
<P>
"Seven Samurai" (Criterion Collection/Janus Films-Voyager Press, 203 minutes, 
four CAV regular play discs in Japanese with English subtitles). 
</P>
<P>
These three films by Akira Kurosawa are presented intact and, with the 
exception of the panned-and-scanned "Ran," presented just the way Kurosawa 
envisioned -- uncut with the original language and image preserved. 
</P>
<P>
The 1958 "The Hidden Fortress" is one of Kurosawa's personal favorites, 
acknowledged by George Lucas to be the primary inspiration for "Star Wars." For 
years, the film was seen in the United States in a 90-minute version. This is 
the original 139-minute Cinemascope version of arguably the greatest 
adventure-action film ever made. 
</P>
<P>
The cast of characters includes Princess Yuki and her faithful military 
commandant, Gen. Rokurota Makabe, played by Toshiro Mifune. The story is told 
through the eyes of two minor characters, a pair of peasant farmers whom the 
princess and the general use to aid their escape (their names, however, are not 
R2D2 and C-3PO). The crystal-clear print and the letter-box image retaining the 
original wide-screen format do full justice to Kurosawa's startling images. 
There are 19 chapter stops marking key scenes on the five sides. 
</P>
<P>
The 1985 "Ran," Kurosawa's version of "King Lear," is riveting on the small 
screen even though much of Kurosawa's images (especially the two amazing battle 
scenes) are destroyed in this pan-and-scan version. This laser video disc was 
produced before CBS-Fox video decided to letterbox its wide-screen laser 
editions. That's a pity. It's almost worth waiting for the letter-box version 
of the film, when and if it is released. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the videotape, this laser disc edition, however, captures Kurosawa's 
brilliant use of color (he almost makes the color a separate character in the 
film). The CBS-Fox package is sloppy, however; there are no chapter stops 
listed and no digital sound. 
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Criterion's "The Seven Samurai" is a model of laser video disc 
production. The 1954 classic, which has served as an inspiration for many U.S. 
Westerns, including "The Magnificent Seven," was reproduced from a new, 
unsubtitled 35mm print and struck from the restored Japanese negative. 
Subtitles were added electronically so they would not take away from the film's 
images. The translation is new and closer, the experts say, to the Japanese 
original. In addition, there is an audio essay by Kurosawa expert Michael Jeck 
discussing the making of the film. 
</P>
<P>
One of the most popular Japanese films ever made, "Seven Samurai" features 
Mifune in one of his greatest roles, that of a would-be samurai. Twenty-nine 
chapter stops make it possible to review some of Kurosawa's startling 
achievements: the use of slow motion in the sword-fight scenes (Chapters 4 and 
7), the heart-stopping battle scenes (Chapters 23, 25 and 28), and the 
memorable surprise attack (Chapter 21). BARBARA SALTZMAN

BEBOP RECORDS: WHERE A FIXTURE OF RESEDA'S MUSIC SCENE ONCE WAS, VORTEX OFFERS 
ART AND POETRY READINGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
When Bebop Records closed in June, the Valley lost one of its favorite 
hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
Bebop sold used records by day, and by night became an unusually eclectic stage 
for song and poetry. 
</P>
<P>
Such well-known musicians as Los Lobos, Exene Cervenka and Jane's Addiction 
performed there. The likes of Jim Carroll, Kate Braverman and La Loca read 
there. 
</P>
<P>
But owner Richard Bruland called it quits after eight years when city officials 
cited him for hosting performances without a proper permit. 
</P>
<P>
Now the Reseda shop has reopened with much of its aestheticism intact. A 
Burbank woman named Melody Cooper has rented the storefront and converted it 
into a gallery. 
</P>
<P>
The newly named Vortex offers shelves of pottery and walls filled with 
paintings and collages. Art classes are given on a regular basis. Poets will be 
glad to know that a small performance space in the rear is used for 7:30 p.m. 
readings on the second and last Wednesdays of each month. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm trying a lot of different things," Cooper said. "I want to keep changing 
the art on display." 
</P>
<P>
Twenty local artists are showing works at the gallery. When there are no 
customers, Cooper works on her own art, pottery. Two wheels and a considerable 
amount of clay dust inhabit the premises. 
</P>
<P>
And Bruland -- who left the business world to concentrate on his painting -- is 
scheduled to show some of his work at Vortex in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
"Richard is happy to be gone and doing his art," Cooper said. "And I'm very 
happy to be here. I think it's good for everybody." DAVID WHARTON

THEATER: ENCINO AND CSUN PROGRAMS PERSEVERE, WHILE PLANS FOR SHERMAN OAKS GROUP 
ARE UNCLEAR.

<P>
The founders of the new Encino Playhouse managed to pull off a rare feat for a 
fledgling theater group: They made their debut on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
As they had promised in June, the company staged its first show in September in 
a 250-seat theater in the Encino Community Center. "Gift Rap," a children's 
show, ran for five weeks. 
</P>
<P>
December has been hectic for the group, which earlier this month staged 
"Holiday Faire," another musical for children, and "The Cardigan Christmas 
Show," a sendup of traditional holiday specials on television. 
</P>
<P>
In February, the Playhouse hopes to raise enough money to stage its first 
original show, "Miss Moffat," a musical based on the play "The Corn Is Green." 
The musical, although never previously performed, has a long history. Its book 
was written by Joshua Logan and Emlyn Williams, both of whom have since died, 
and the music was composed by another theater veteran, Albert Hague. 
</P>
<P>
"Miss Moffat" was brought to the attention of the founder of the Encino 
Playhouse, Stephanie Angelini, by Thomas O'Malley, a writer who had been trying 
to get the musical on its feet. O'Malley has done some rewriting for the local 
production, which will be staged only if the playhouse can raise the necessary 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the founders of a Sherman Oaks group known as the Valley Civic Light 
Opera have not fared as well. They announced in March that by the end of the 
year, they intended to start a subscription season of major musicals in the San 
Fernando Valley, but the promised season did not materialize. Future plans are 
unclear. Telephone messages left on the answering machine at the group's office 
in Sherman Oaks were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
And at Cal State Northridge, officials have decided to continue the 
university's highly touted Teen-Age Drama Workshop, which has offered summer 
acting instruction to high school students for 34 years. 
</P>
<P>
Continuation of the program was thrown into question by the new year-round 
schedule for public schools. It was feared that not enough students would be 
available to take the workshops in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to go ahead, although we are still working out what would be 
the best dates for the workshop," said Heinrich Falk, acting chairman of the 
CSUN theater department. DAVID COLKER

GALLERY: THE LANKERSHIM ARTS CENTER IS A NEIGHBORHOOD HAVEN.

Six months after its establishment, the Lankershim Arts Center in North 
Hollywood has fulfilled its goal of becoming an outpost for San Fernando Valley 
artists, according to Earl Sherburn, community arts director of the Los Angeles 
Cultural Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
Sherburn said the center has attracted about 200 people to the openings of each 
month's featured exhibit, and several dozen visitors a day during the week. 
</P>
<P>
The center has had six main exhibits and showcased the work of about 150 
artists since it opened in June. "It's been very well-received by the 
community," Sherburn said. 
</P>
<P>
Sherburn said the center is already booked for exhibits through September. 
Among the upcoming shows are Monticello Miller's "Oil on Photography" in 
February and Candice O'Campo's sculpture exhibit in March. 
</P>
<P>
The center originally intended to offer art classes on the second floor, but 
renovation of that area has been delayed. An architect's report isn't due until 
February. Sherburn hopes to hold classes by early summer. MICHAEL ARKUSH

ANTELOPE VALLEY: LANCASTER LOOKS TOWARD A SPRING OPENING, AND PALMDALE HAS 
PLANS FOR A NEW THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Construction of a 700-seat performing arts theater in Lancaster, featured in an 
April article about theaters in the Antelope Valley, has remained almost on 
schedule even in the wake of a tragic accident. 
</P>
<P>
In October, during a tour of the construction site by members of the Lancaster 
Woman's Club, 87-year-old Viola Parr died after falling 20 feet from a 
staircase into the orchestra pit. "The other women who knew her knew that she 
was very devoted to the arts," Susan Davis, the city's cultural arts 
superintendent, said. "They said there was no way she would have wanted this 
project to be stalled by what took place." 
</P>
<P>
Since the accident, there have been no tours of the Lancaster Performing Arts 
Center, scheduled to be completed in spring. 
</P>
<P>
Davis was hired in September to oversee operation of the city-owned arts 
center. A former management assistant to the city manager of Lancaster, she has 
had no previous experience in running a theater. 
</P>
<P>
She said negotiations are under way to bring a one-person show to the theater 
for the gala opening, followed by several other acts, including a touring opera 
company. She declined to name any of the proposed performers. 
</P>
<P>
Because the theater will be by far the biggest and best equipped in the 
Antelope Valley, Davis said she has been besieged with inquiries from community 
performance groups, schools, churches and local dance studios. No policy has 
been set on how much community groups will be charged to use the facility. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, plans to build a nearly identically sized theater in nearby Palmdale 
have been drastically overhauled -- twice. In June, the City Council decided to 
scrap plans to build the theater because of the ever-rising estimated cost of 
the proposed project, a figure that could go as high as $8 million. Instead, it 
voted to renovate a 40-year-old, 400-seat high school auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
But in October community groups convinced the council that the renovation would 
cost nearly as much as a new 400-seat theater. The council voted to go forward 
with developing plans for the new, scaled-down theater on land donated by a 
local developer. 
</P>
<P>
David Milligan, head of the community arts group that used its own money to 
hire an architectural firm to do the design, said the next step is to have the 
council approve the design. He said he hopes that the Palmdale theater will be 
ready to open in two years. DAVID COLKER

<P>
In the midst of a forlorn battle to save his citrus crop from a deadly 
freeze,the U.S. Air Force Reserve notified Ojai grower Bob Davis to prepare for 
a possible call to active duty in support of Operation Desert Shield. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, a lieutenant colonel, was too involved with fighting nature to be overly 
concerned about going to war at age 51. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought, 'When it rains, it pours,' " said Davis of the letter that arrived 
Christmas Eve. "What else could go wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, Davis learned that orchard heaters, wind machines, helicopters and 
relatives were enough to save only about half of his 100-acre orange and lemon 
crop. But Davis felt even worse for a neighbor as he listened to the wind 
rustling the freeze-dried leaves of an adjacent avocado grove. 
</P>
<P>
"Isn't that a terrible sound?" said Davis, standing in a section of his 
orchards where temperatures fell to 23 degrees Saturday. "That's certainly not 
the rustle of money." 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he remains upbeat because of his investment philosophy. "Real money 
is made slowly over a long period of time." 
</P>
<P>
But real money also was lost quickly last week. One of the century's worst 
freezes robbed Davis and other Ventura County growers of an estimated $100 
million worth of produce. The full extent of damage might not be known for 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
Davis, ranch manager Henry Cardoza and members of their families invested 
several nights of sweat equity trying to get ground temperatures above the 
28-degree level. About a third of Davis' property, which his parents bought in 
1937, lacked orchard heaters, helicopter support and water insulation, relying 
only on towering wind machines to keep temperatures from dipping below 28 for 
more than the critical four-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, the president of the Ojai-Tapo Citrus Assn. toured Davis' property 
for a damage assessment. Al Bakalian, whose association is a growers' 
cooperative linked to Sunkist, estimated that half of Davis' crop might have 
survived the freeze, although much of the fruit could be damaged and will not 
bring a premium price. 
</P>
<P>
Davis fared better than many Ojai Valley growers, said Bakalian, who had toured 
15 farms by Thursday afternoon. He estimated that 70% of the valley's citrus 
crop is lost. 
</P>
<P>
The freeze hit randomly throughout Davis' groves. Some trees bore crumpled, 
turned-up leaves that had changed to a lime-green color, while others across 
the road appeared fine. In many cases, trees appeared to suffer freezer burn on 
one side but were fairly lush on the other. 
</P>
<P>
Davis picked an orange from one of his hardest-hit trees and, upon slicing, 
showed where the sacs had burst, allowing the juice to run freely inside. The 
skin appeared slightly translucent, while the fruit itself was mushy. 
</P>
<P>
"No question that this fruit is blasted," Davis said. Within a few weeks "the 
dead fruit will look like straw inside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said navel oranges should fare better than Valencias, because they were 
riper and bore more sugar, which helped against the cold. He has three acres of 
oranges planted for each acre of lemons, with Valencias making up 90% of his 
orange crop. Severely damaged Valencias would be too young to salvage quickly 
for juice processing, since they were not due for harvest until at least April, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
Some of Davis' younger trees appeared to be reeling from drought rather than a 
cold snap. "It almost looks like they wilted because we didn't water them," 
said Davis as he walked by unthawed patches of ice still remaining on the 
ground from irrigation water sprayed as an insulator. "I don't know whether 
these younger trees will survive." 
</P>
<P>
Even if the trees do survive, freeze damage can affect their yield for several 
years. "The better shape they're in now, the better set we'll be for next 
year," said Davis, who is preparing to harvest what's left of his lemon crop in 
the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
As for the value of marketable fruit, Bakalian said packinghouses accept a 
special grade that carry no outward scars but might be of lower quality inside. 
The freeze-damaged oranges and lemons will fetch 20% less than top-grade fruit, 
but still bring 5% more than fruit damaged outside but not within, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"People still buy with their eyes," Bakalian said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said fruit with only limited sections of burst juice sacs can heal 
themselves and make the special grade. "Most of the fruit on these trees, if it 
isn't lost, it will be downgraded," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Davis said he went through about 10,000 gallons of diesel fuel in keeping his 
1,200 orchard heaters lit. He almost ran out of fuel in the midst of the 
freeze, but a neighbor provided nearly 4,000 gallons and he took delivery 
Monday of about 7,500 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Davis took time out Wednesday to play a round of golf with his son, Rob, and 
then slept through the night for the first time in a week. During the coldest 
nights, Davis got by on less than two hours of sleep grabbed in about 30-minute 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
"I still have something to save," said Davis, referring to another anticipated 
cold snap this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
The fruit still salvageable from his depleted crop will be worth saving even 
more this weekend. Davis said prices paid to navel orange growers jumped more 
than 50% since the freeze hit. 
</P>
<P>
As for his military notice, Davis said it is just a coincidence that he is 
flying to Canada for a ski trip next week.

"The letter did say in support of Desert Shield, so I'll probably end up in San 
Pedro" at an Air Force Reserve regional headquarters, said Davis, who served as 
an Air Force captain in the mid-1960s. "You're in the reserves, that's what 
you're there for. I don't think it will happen, but if I get called, I'll go."

RETAILER SAYS CITY NEGLECTS DOWNTOWN QUAKE SAFETY; 
</P>
<P>
VENTURA: A MAIN STREET MERCHANT CHARGES THAT LANDOWNER INFLUENCE HAS KEPT THE 
COUNCIL FROM REQUIRING BUILDING UPGRADES.

<P>
Controversy over whether the city of Ventura has done enough for earthquake 
safety erupted Thursday when a Main Street merchant accused the City Council of 
yielding to influence from the largest downtown property owner. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Zwirn, who owns The Paul Bunyan Shop, charged that the city should have 
required upgrades long ago to make unreinforced masonry buildings safe enough 
to withstand the major earthquake that scientists say is inevitable in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
But Zwirn, who posted a sign in his window Thursday saying that his building 
could become a "death trap" if an earthquake hit, said the largest downtown 
property owner, Ventura Realty Co., had influenced the City Council to defeat 
an earthquake ordinance two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Nonsense," said Tom Wood, general manager and attorney for Ventura Reality, 
which is predominantly owned by members of the Lagomarsino family. Wood, a 
nephew of Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino (R-Ventura), said the company was founded 
by his great-grandfather in 1908. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he has long supported an ordinance requiring the level of upgrades 
needed to protect life in the event of an earthquake. But he said he fought 
against the more stringent law that city engineering consultants recommended in 
1988, which would have required extensive upgrades to preserve the buildings as 
well as save lives. 
</P>
<P>
The upgrades to save the structures could include adding steel bars to 
reinforce walls, replacing mortar between bricks or making the foundation more 
stable. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't fault the city for trusting in their consultants," he said. "But you 
can't fault us for influencing legislation that was unwarranted either." 
</P>
<P>
Wood said he hopes that the city's next ordinance, which is expected to be 
introduced next spring, will not "destroy what it is trying to protect." 
</P>
<P>
The city of Ventura has 143 unreinforced masonry buildings, mostly downtown. 
Improvements on those buildings might already be under way if city consultants 
had not pushed for the more stringent ordinance. The tougher ordinance created 
opposition among merchants and property owners, including Wood, who said they 
could not afford the expensive work. 
</P>
<P>
Despite a change in the ordinance to require the minimum level of upgrades, 
threats of lawsuits from two property owners, including the owner of the 
building that houses The Paul Bunyan Shop, led the council to defeat the 
ordinance, said Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community development. 
</P>
<P>
But he said, a new law must be passed soon. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an ordinance that should have been on the books a long time ago," he 
said. "We are sort of tempting fate." 
</P>
<P>
Millais said a city environmental impact report, which was ordered after the 
lawsuits were threatened two years ago, is due out in mid-January. He said the 
report recommends that the city require owners to begin the first level of 
upgrades by tying walls to roofs and floors. 
</P>
<P>
However, over 20 years, the report recommends that the building owners should 
do much more extensive reinforcing, bringing their properties up to a second or 
third level of upgrade, Millais said. If the owners chose not to upgrade the 
buildings, they would have to pay to have them razed and removed. 
</P>
<P>
Wood said two of the seven unreinforced masonry buildings that Ventura Realty 
owns downtown may have to be razed and rebuilt in several years. Those two 
buildings, in the 300 block of Main Street, are just plain "cruddy" buildings, 
he said, and not worth the money to fix them. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura Realty has already spent $100,000 to perform the first level of repairs 
on the building that houses Franky's Place on Main Street. The face of the 
building remains dismantled while Wood decides whether to install a steel bar 
the width of the building to begin the second level of upgrades. 
</P>
<P>
He said he understood Zwirn's frustration with his building, because the owner, 
Andrew Chakires, has done no earthquake upgrades and vehemently opposes any 
ordinance that forces even minor earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
Chakires said Thursday that the state has not proven that unreinforced masonry 
buildings are at high risk of crumbling in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
"They have only shown us anecdotal evidence," he said, referring to the 
crumbled buildings in Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Coalinga and Whittier. "You're 
at higher risk of getting cancer from benzene when you buy gasoline than you 
are from getting killed by an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
But Zwirn said he wants all downtown shoppers to know about the condition of 
the buildings. 
</P>
<P>
"All the other merchants on Main Street are afraid to say anything because they 
are all worried about their own little businesses," he said. "But they don't 
understand that people are afraid to shop downtown because they are afraid of 
what would happen in an earthquake."

POLICE TAKE AIM AT NEW YEAR'S EVE GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In a stepped-up effort to prevent a deadly barrage of gunfire on New Year's 
Eve, officials have enacted a citywide ban on munitions sales and announced 
plans Thursday to arrest revelers who shoot off firearms as part of holiday 
celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
The campaign, coupled with an advertising blitz, is designed to stop people 
from firing guns into the air to mark the new year -- an illegal and sometimes 
deadly tradition that police battle annually. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Los Angeles Police Chief Robert Vernon said teams of officers will be 
sent to neighborhoods throughout the city on New Year's Eve to discourage the 
gunplay. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to blanket the city with police officers," Vernon told a news 
conference. "And there's a good chance you'll get arrested if you fire (a) gun 
into the air." 
</P>
<P>
Every year, scores of revelers ring in the new year in Los Angeles and other 
cities by shooting rounds of ammunition skyward. And each year, police say, 
errant bullets wound and sometimes kill people and damage property. 
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve 1988, 1,247 shootings were reported to Los Angeles police and 
two people were killed. 
</P>
<P>
Things were better the next year: Shootings were down 43%, no one was killed 
and eight people were wounded, police say; 73 people were arrested under a new 
state law that makes such gunplay a felony. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Jan. 1 is a time of celebration," Vernon said. "Unfortunately, every 
Jan. 2 (is) a time we count the bullets that come back down to the ground. And 
unfortunately, we count some of those bullets in people." 
</P>
<P>
In the South-Central area of Los Angeles, where police say most of the shooting 
occurs, 685 officers -- more than twice the normal number -- will be on duty 
New Year's Eve, said Deputy Chief William M. Rathburn, commander of the South 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
Their orders this year, Rathburn said, are to stay out on the streets. In the 
past, police have often sought shelter from raining bullets under freeway 
overpasses or have stuck close to the station around midnight, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We will not do that this year," Rathburn said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the police deployment, officials are placing billboards 
throughout the city, airing public service announcements on television and 
radio and distributing thousands of flyers to homes and schools. All warn that 
a bullet fired into the sky can kill. 
</P>
<P>
While officials have mounted similar efforts in the past, the weeklong ban on 
the sale of ammunition this year is new. Signed into law by Mayor Tom Bradley 
last May, it was first tested last July 4 and went into effect again on 
Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley, who joined Vernon at the news conference, compared the random gunfire 
to "playing Russian roulette with the lives of community members." 
</P>
<P>
"In this city . . . we will not tolerate the illegal use of weapons to 
celebrate the coming of the new year," Bradley said. 
</P>
<P>
Undercover police officers are making the rounds at gun stores to look for 
violations of the ban, Vernon said. So far, none have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
Owners of gun shops, meanwhile, labeled the ban a political ploy that misses 
the point. Some said that they applaud efforts to stop illegal gunplay on 
holidays but that prohibiting the sale of bullets is not the way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
"If you can drive just a few hundred yards into Burbank (to buy ammunition), 
what have you accomplished?" said Barry Kahn, co-owner of B&amp;B Sales, a 
major gun store in North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
"If you are really serious about the loss of life and limb and wanted to do 
something about it . . . how about banning the sale of liquor?" 
</P>
<P>
Kahn said he has had to turn away dozens of customers since the ban took 
effect, at a loss of "several thousand dollars" a day. Many customers would 
normally be buying ammunition for holiday hunting trips, he said. 
</P>
<P>
But police say that sales go up this time of year precisely for the New Year's 
Eve gunplay. 
</P>
<P>
Violating the munitions-sale ban is a misdemeanor punishable by up to six 
months in jail and a $500 fine, Vernon said. Shooting a weapon into the air is 
a felony that carries a jail term of up to three years.

5 ANGLOS ON COUNCIL CALL TORRES A 'RACIST'; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: HIS REMARKS ABOUT NATURE OF THE BELL GARDENS LEGISLATIVE BODY TURN UP 
THE HEAT IN THE 1ST SUPERVISORIAL DISTRICT RACE. LAWMAKERS HAD ENDORSED 
CALDERON IN THE CONTEST.

<P>
The five members of Bell Gardens' all-Anglo City Council on Thursday called 
state Sen. Art Torres a "racist" because he said the council does not properly 
represent the overwhelmingly Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to Torres, the council members demanded an apology for the 
remarks, made during a heated council meeting at which a controversial overhaul 
of city zoning laws was being considered. 
</P>
<P>
Torres told the council: "The nature of the scope of the people that I see in 
front of me (on the council dais) doesn't reflect the population which lives 
within the city of Bell Gardens. . . . We need to organize better to make sure 
that we have people that look like me sitting up there." 
</P>
<P>
Torres (D-Los Angeles) is a candidate for Los Angeles County supervisor. All 
five council members who signed the letter accusing him of racism had earlier 
endorsed one of Torres' rivals in the election, state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
(D-Whittier). 
</P>
<P>
Torres said Thursday that he was merely making an observation on the political 
reality of Bell Gardens, located in southeastern Los Angeles County. Although 
Bell Gardens is 85% Latino, it has never elected a Latino City Council member. 
</P>
<P>
Denying that his remarks were racist, Torres said: "I have nothing to regret." 
</P>
<P>
In their open letter to Torres, the council members called the state senator's 
remarks "morally repugnant." 
</P>
<P>
"Your statements call into question your ability to serve the many diverse 
cultures contained in the 1st Supervisorial District," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy is an illustration of the continuing political fallout from the 
rapidly changing demographics of southeastern Los Angeles County, where Latinos 
are now a majority in several cities. 
</P>
<P>
The Jan. 22 supervisorial election was ordered by a federal court judge who 
found that the all-Anglo Board of Supervisors had drawn district boundaries to 
discriminate against Latinos. The judge created a new 1st District with a 70% 
Latino majority. 
</P>
<P>
In September, three Bell Gardens residents filed suit against the city in U.S. 
District Court in Los Angeles, charging that the citywide election system is 
racially biased. 
</P>
<P>
Once a semi-rural bedroom community of Anglo Midwestern migrants, Bell Gardens 
has seen its Latino population skyrocket in the last two decades. The city of 
42,000 people now is one of the state's most densely populated communities. 
</P>
<P>
In a City Council election last April, two defeated Latina candidates found the 
largest obstacle to their election was not their Anglo opposition but Latino 
voter apathy -- Bell Gardens has one of the lowest Latino voter registration 
rates in the county. 
</P>
<P>
In response to the accusations, Torres acknowledged that the council members 
were not entirely to blame for the Latinos' lack of representation. Latinos, he 
said, have "only themselves to blame" for their absence in city government. 
</P>
<P>
The controversy began when Torres addressed a Dec. 17 council meeting packed 
with 600 residents, most of them Latinos. The council voted at the meeting to 
approve new zoning laws aimed at reducing the population by ridding the city of 
many apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
More than 3,000 properties will be affected by the zoning change, scheduled to 
go into effect in 20 years. Some residents will be forced to move to make way 
for new commercial and industrial districts. Most of those displaced will 
likely be Latinos. Many have charged that the council is trying "to drive 
(Latinos) out of town." 
</P>
<P>
Council members Ronald Bird and Robert Cunningham said their accusations 
against Torres were not intended to influence the Jan. 22 supervisorial 
election. Still, they sent copies of the letter to the 19 city councils in the 
1st District. 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Calderon appeared eager to take political advantage of the 
controversy. He called upon Torres to apologize. 
</P>
<P>
"I think that was clearly a racist remark," Calderon said. "Sen. Torres can 
disagree with the policy issues, but to say the council is acting based on race 
is completely irresponsible."

KISSINGER TO SPEAK AT BANK'S APRIL EVENT

<P>
Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger is scheduled to appear in Oxnard to 
share his insights on the Middle East crisis as the guest speaker for Ventura 
County National Bank's "An Evening With . . . " series. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been considering inviting Mr. Kissinger for the past 1 1/2 years, but 
when the Iraq-Kuwait problem broke, we decided this was the year to have him," 
said W.E. (Bill) McAleer, president and chief executive officer of the bank. 
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, a Nobel Peace Prize winner who served as national security adviser 
to Presidents Nixon and Ford, will speak at the Oxnard Civic Center April 23. 
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the outcome in the Middle East, the problems there will not all 
be over by April and Kissinger's observations will still be interesting and 
pertinent," McAleer said. 
</P>
<P>
This is the sixth year of the series. The bank pays for the speaker, this year 
costing $35,000, and for the after-show buffet reception. All proceeds from 
ticket sales goes to a local charity, which will be selected in January. 
</P>
<P>
The bank sends invitations to people on its mailing list, ranging from students 
to the Board of Supervisors, McAleer said. Seating is limited to the 1,600-seat 
civic center and the bank offers tickets to those who apply earliest. "The 
place always gets packed," McAleer said. Anyone can add their name to the 
mailing list by writing to the bank, he added. 
</P>
<P>
Past guests include Watergate co-conspirator G. Gordon Liddy and political 
satirist Mark Russell. MAJA RADEVICH

More than $500,000 in community contributions, an increase of 39% over the 
previous year, has been received by the Ventura Department of Parks and 
Recreation for the 1989-90 fiscal year, according to a recently released annual 
report. 
</P>
<P>
The $514,000 figure is based on volunteer hours at minimum wage, various cash 
donations and other contributions from businesses and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of our programs and services would not be possible without the dedicated 
support of approximately 600 volunteers who help by serving hot meals to 
seniors, giving tours of historical sites, assisting with special events and 
beautifying our parks," said Barbara Harison, department director. 
</P>
<P>
Over the last several years, the Ventura Avenue Lions Club has contributed 
nearly $50,000 to the Harry A. Lyon Youth Scholarship Fund, which has enabled 
190 needy youths to participate in a variety of recreation classes, camps and 
sports programs, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
"We've received total support from the community," said Debbie Solomon, a 
department spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
"We're very proud of that. We feel a lot of it has to do with how much people 
value their community. . . . Volunteerism is very much alive and well. We've 
seen a total resurgence of it." 
</P>
<P>
The department provides programs and services to about 1.5 million residents 
and visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
It oversees the operation and management of 22 community parks, two golf 
courses, two senior centers, two community centers, the Olivas Adobe and Ortega 
Adobe historical sites and the Albinger Archaeological Museum. GERRY BRAILO

'POSSE' HAS YOUNG READERS DOING TIME

Moorpark schoolteacher Peggy Weak had a brainstorm last summer that has 
inspired students at Peach Hill School to zoom through more than 522,000 
minutes of reading time at home since September. 
</P>
<P>
Weak was attending a PTA meeting with one of her colleagues, who happened to 
have a pet opossum sitting on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"We had volunteered to do a float for Moorpark's Country Days, and we threw 
around the name Peach Hill Possums, but came up with Peach Hill Posse," Weak 
said. "On my way home, the idea just lent itself to a reading incentive 
program." 
</P>
<P>
Now, teachers wear T-shirts with the message, "Wanted: Readers," and parents 
display Peach Hill Posse bumper stickers on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
The involvement of everyone is the crux of the program's success, said 
Principal Juanita Suarez, and readers have received encouragement from First 
Lady Barbara Bush and entertainers Michael Jackson and Frank Sinatra, who sent 
letters or autographed pictures to the students. 
</P>
<P>
Depending on the amount of time students read or are read to at home, they 
receive monthly awards at a "roundup assembly" at the end of each month. 
</P>
<P>
Awards range from a Peach Hill Posse pin for 200 minutes of reading to a 
sheriff's badge for 3,000 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Parent Cindy Gibbons said her son, Tommy, 7, was having reading problems at the 
end of first grade last spring. She was contacted by the school and told that 
Tommy should be placed in a special reading class. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, when the reading incentive program started, he would say that he had 
to get his reading minutes in, like a contest. But after a few weeks, it was no 
longer a contest -- he wanted to read." 
</P>
<P>
Gibbons said the reading time has brought her family together. 
</P>
<P>
"I work two jobs and sometimes I'm tired. But the other night we put in 45 
minutes . . . we were just having fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tommy has improved so much in his reading that he may be leaving the special 
reading class soon, Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
As part of the plan to get the 760 students interested in the program, a 
kickoff assembly was held last September. Moorpark middle school teacher Ray 
Hebel, who performs around the world as an Elvis Presley impersonator, put on a 
Western show as Wrangler Ray. 
</P>
<P>
Later in the month, the neighborhood school for kindergarten through 
third-grade students hosted a chuck wagon dinner with square dancers and 
storytellers who told stories about Pecos Bill and Davy Crockett. More than 800 
students, parents and staff members attended. 
</P>
<P>
By October, the students had logged 250,000 minutes, and had more than 522,000 
at last count. More events are planned to keep the momentum going, including 
another chuck wagon dinner in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
"All reports from parents are, 'My kids want to read now.' Part of our concern 
is that we want kids to really enjoy reading," Suarez said. GERRY BRAILO

VENTURA COUNTY NEWS ROUNDUP: CASITAS SPRINGS; 
</P>
<P>
PLANS FOR PLANT ALARM RESIDENTS

<P>
A proposal to build an ozone-generating plant on an earthquake fault has 
alarmed Casitas Springs residents who say their fears of toxic spills and other 
risks are not being addressed. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Garcia Weed said she is one of 280 residents in the small community 
near Foster Park who oppose building a large water treatment plant below 
Casitas Dam. 
</P>
<P>
"We're so close. We're going to be in extreme danger if these toxic fumes will 
be released in this area," Weed said. 
</P>
<P>
Richard Barnett, chief engineer of Casitas Municipal Water District, said his 
staff heard residents' concerns in June and spent extra time addressing them in 
a draft environmental report released recently. 
</P>
<P>
The report concludes that the $27.8-million plant would not have any 
significant impact on the environment if all safety standards and procedures 
are followed. 
</P>
<P>
"There will be no ozone released into the atmosphere," Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
The water district was ordered in 1987 to bring Lake Casitas water up to state 
and federal drinking water standards by 1992. The water is disinfected with 
chlorine to serve 56,500 residents in the western county. 
</P>
<P>
The new plant would filter and treat 32 million gallons of water per day. 
Hydroelectric turbines would provide power to pump ozone and other chemicals 
directly into the lines before the water is sold. 
</P>
<P>
Pat Baggerly of the Environmental Coalition of Ventura County said the 
coalition also questions several of the report's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
"The Red Mountain Fault is an enormous concern they have not answered," 
Baggerly said. Various geologists predict that the Red Mountain Fault that runs 
under the dam could have an earthquake measuring from 6 to 7.5 on the Richter 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
A public hearing on the draft document has been scheduled for 7 p.m. on Jan. 9 
in the Oak View Community Center. THIA BELL

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: DELIBERATIONS RESUME IN JEWELRY-DRUG CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A federal court jury in Los Angeles, after confirming the convictions of four 
men accused of laundering $350 million in drug profits through jewelry 
companies, was ordered Thursday to resume deliberations on undecided counts. 
</P>
<P>
The jury on Wednesday found Nazareth Andonian, his brother, Vahe Andonian, and 
Juan Carlos Seresi guilty of conspiring to launder money. 
</P>
<P>
However, the panel was dismissed before it could confirm the verdicts and make 
them official. That confirmation took place Thursday. The Andonians and the 
alleged mastermind of the scheme, Raul Vivas, 39, were also found guilty on 25 
other counts of money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the judge instructed the jury, over objections of several defense 
lawyers, to resume deliberations to try to break an impasse on five other 
counts of money laundering against Seresi and on all counts against defendant 
Ruben Saini.

BILL BOYARSKY: THE FIGHT TO SAVE THE 9TH DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Tom Bradley was growing up, he lived in a poor area just south of downtown 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
I bring up that biographical note because Bradley, now the mayor, may be called 
upon next year to save the old neighborhood from being dismembered by some very 
accomplished City Hall political surgeons. 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood is part of the 9th City Council District, represented by 
90-year-old Gilbert Lindsay, who's paralyzed from a stroke, unable to speak and 
not expected to recover. 
</P>
<P>
In just a few months, the City Council will draw new boundaries for its 15 
districts. It's well known that redistricting brings out the worst in a 
politician, but with Lindsay hospitalized, some 9th District political 
activists fear it will be worse than usual. 
</P>
<P>
They've told me they're afraid that council members may try to grab the 
commercial portion of the district -- downtown, Little Tokyo and Chinatown -- 
and divide it among themselves. "They can't wait to take the upper portion of 
the district," said Lois Medlock, president of the South East Central 
Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
The districts of Gloria Molina, Bob Farrell, Nate Holden and Richard Alatorre 
border the 9th. While all four deny a land grab, Medlock and some other 
activists fear the temptation of representing downtown's heavy-contributing 
real estate developers will prove too strong to resist. 
</P>
<P>
Bradley enters the picture because only a mayoral veto could stop that sort of 
redistricting plan. 
</P>
<P>
Medlock lives in the mostly black and Latino southern portion of the 9th, which 
extends about 70 blocks south of downtown. It has most of the residents and the 
poverty. Downtown, Little Tokyo and Chinatown in the north, while home to far 
fewer voters, have the big commercial developments. 
</P>
<P>
During Lindsay's long reign, the southern part of the district has been treated 
as a neglected colony. Residents paid taxes without getting much from City 
Hall. Lindsay catered to the downtown, Chinatown and Little Tokyo developers. 
Builders weren't required to pay big fees for zoning concessions -- fees that 
could have been used to begin housing and commercial development in South L.A. 
</P>
<P>
The worst example of the city's behavior occurred in 1986, when Lindsay and 
Bradley backed construction of a huge incinerator in a predominantly 
residential neighborhood at 41st and Alameda streets to burn the city's trash. 
Medlock and other community activists protested and forced abandonment of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
Their upset victory sparked a wave of grass-roots political activity with a 
single goal: economic revival of one of Los Angeles' blue-collar neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
City Hall came under pressure to force developers to share their wealth. 
Activists had hopes that Lindsay was beginning to get that message before he 
was stricken. But the activists fear that their efforts are now in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
So far, there's no real public move to justify their fears. Concerned about 
Lindsay's illness, the council's Rules and Elections Committee is preparing a 
city charter amendment that would permit removal of an incapacitated council 
member. If approved by the council, the amendment would be on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
But there's no guarantee that the current nay-saying electorate will approve 
the measure. And if voters do, it'll take a few months before a special 
election -- with its campaign and possible runoff -- will be held. A new 
council member might not take over until the fall. And by fall, the new census 
figures will have arrived in City Hall, beginning the redistricting process. 
</P>
<P>
But some recent council history doesn't give Medlock and other community 
leaders much comfort about what may happen in the interim. 
</P>
<P>
They remember that when Councilman Howard Finn died in 1986 during a 
redistricting crisis, his San Fernando Valley 1st District was split up to make 
sure other council members would get the boundaries they wanted. Complaints 
from Finn's old constituents were ignored. 
</P>
<P>
Groups of neighborhood leaders have met with the mayor privately, asking him to 
guard against a council breakup of the 9th. Deputy Mayor Mark Fabiani said the 
leaders have "a legitimate concern." And in general, Fabiani said, the mayor 
believes "the 9th District ought to be preserved." 
</P>
<P>
If Bradley saves the 9th, he'll have accepted the argument put forth by the 
neighborhood activists: Preservation of the current district lines is needed 
for economic restoration of South L.A. That would make it more like the South 
L.A. of Bradley's youth, where industrial plants and other commercial 
enterprises provided jobs for working-class residents. There was poverty, but 
the possibility of a job meant there also was hope.

The holiday season arrived at a time of financial hardship for some, but not 
for our servants. 
</P>
<P>
We mean, our public servants. 
</P>
<P>
By a happy coincidence -- for them -- L.A.-area legislators at the federal, 
state and city levels have all received juicy pay raises recently. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the House of Representatives hiked their own salaries 25% to 
$125,100. Assembly and state Senate members granted themselves boosts of 28.6% 
to $52,500 (to go along with $20,000 in yearly living expenses, plus other 
fringe benefits). And L.A. City Council members received 40% pay increases, 
raising their salaries to $86,157. 
</P>
<P>
Happy holidays, dear legislators, from the rest of us -- your Santas. 
</P>
<P>
The first French dip sandwiches in L.A. were served at Philippe's, the 
82-year-old eatery near Union Station. L.A.'s first chili burgers are usually 
credited to Ptomaine Tommy's, a sawdust-on-the-floor fixture on North Broadway 
for four decades before it closed in 1958. 
</P>
<P>
But who served the first pizza here? 
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the editor of Westways, the Auto Club magazine, Frank Gehley of 
Mission Viejo recalled that "in the early '40s, we knew of only one place to 
get pizza, a food that wasn't all that popular then. It was in Hollywood in a 
small cafe run by a gentleman who played bit parts in movies." 
</P>
<P>
Westways restaurant critic Paul Wallach responded that there was such a cafe on 
Cahuenga Boulevard "called Patsy D'Amore, which was also the name of the man 
who owned it. . . . It attracted a huge celebrity following with the likes of 
Frank Sinatra and Jimmy Durante." 
</P>
<P>
OK, now here's a tougher one: The first kosher pizza place. 
</P>
<P>
We nominate Fairfax Kosher Pizza Dairy Restaurant, established on Fairfax 
Avenue in 1986. The cafe's business card notes that it's open Sunday through 
Friday, closing Friday "2 hr. before Shabbos (the Sabbath, which starts at 
sundown)," in keeping with Orthodox Jewish law. 
</P>
<P>
T om LaBonge of Silver Lake nominates a stretch of a few feet along the Zoo 
Drive off-ramp of the Ventura Freeway as the shortest respite between 
construction zones in the city. 
</P>
<P>
Lake View Terrace residents in the San Fernando Valley thought they had won 
their battle to prevent a drug treatment center from moving into a vacant 
hospital building. Then they were startled to see the building suddenly 
outfitted with barred windows and razor wire-topped fences. 
</P>
<P>
But worried calls to local leaders quieted their fears: The building has been 
transformed into a maximum-security mental institution for the filming of 
"Terminator 2."

METRO DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN GETS 42 YEARS TO LIFE IN 8-YEAR-OLD 
GIRL'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A man convicted of molesting and killing his girlfriend's 8-year-old daughter, 
then dumping the body in a San Pedro park and setting it ablaze, was sentenced 
Thursday to 42 years to life in prison. Alejandro Lara, 30, was sentenced by 
Superior Court Commissioner Florence-Marie Cooper for the May 11, 1989, death 
of Alba Susanna Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Lara was found guilty of murder, committing lewd acts upon a child and child 
abuse. The murder trial for the girl's mother, Natividad Flores, 28, begins 
next week. 
</P>
<P>
After her burning body was found in the park, her mother told police that the 
girl had left home in anger after being refused ice cream money. She later 
changed her story and said Alba was punished for refusing to take a bath. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the mother admitted hitting the girl with a broom handle, kicking 
her and tying her up with shoelaces in the mid-city apartment she shared with 
Lara.

2 OJAI MEN RECEIVE AWARDS FOR HEROISM; 
</P>
<P>
GOOD SAMARITANS: TIM DONOGHUE AND BOB LEMON ARE HONORED FOR RISKING THEIR LIVES 
TO RESCUE THREE VICTIMS OF A FIERY CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
More than 10 months after their dramatic rescue of three people after a fiery 
crash on California 33, two men have been honored by the Carnegie Hero Fund 
Commission, officials from the Pittsburgh, Pa.-based commission announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Tim Donoghue and Bob Lemon, both of Ojai, were among 16 people nationwide to 
receive the Carnegie Medal for heroism and awards of $2,500 each. The awards 
honor people who have risked -- or lost -- their lives to save others. 
</P>
<P>
Lemon, a fire safety engineer, was not available for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Donoghue says it still helps him to talk about the frightening sight that 
the two men came upon at 3 a.m. on Feb. 5 on deserted California 33 and the 
events that followed. 
</P>
<P>
They were driving to Los Angeles International Airport, where Lemon was 
scheduled to take an early-morning flight, when they saw what appeared to be a 
small brush fire on the roadside ahead, Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
As they drew closer, Donoghue and Lemon saw that the flames were coming from a 
car and that a man with a bloody face was standing beside it, waving them down. 
</P>
<P>
"It was kind of a grotesque, Stephen King-movie kind of thing," said Donoghue, 
44. 
</P>
<P>
When they pulled over, the two men discovered that a 19-year-old woman was 
trapped inside the burning car, her leg pinned between the passenger seat and 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue said he rushed to a telephone a few blocks away to call for assistance 
while Lemon helped the injured driver. When Donoghue returned, he reached into 
the burning car to try to pull the woman out. 
</P>
<P>
"I remember I was kind of concerned wondering whether the whole car would go 
up" in flames, Donoghue said. "It was kind of engulfed. But I saw she was a 
normal-sized girl and I'm kind of a big-sized person, so I said, 'I should be 
able to do this.' " 
</P>
<P>
His first attempt was unsuccessful, said the 180-pound Donoghue. "It was real 
hot, and the dashboard was dripping on her jeans and sweater," Donoghue said. 
On his second attempt, he was able to free the woman with Lemon's help. 
</P>
<P>
Seconds later, they discovered a third victim, a man who had been thrown 
through the windshield and was lying a few yards in front of the car. The man 
regained consciousness, became delirious and ran up the road. Both rescuers had 
to restrain him until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
The three victims -- Denise Reid, now 20; Dennis Honey, 20, and John Brown, 18 
-- had been returning from Disneyland when Honey fell asleep at the wheel. Now 
fully recovered, the three have kept in contact with their rescuers. Reid and 
Honey, of Ojai, are expecting a baby any day, both said. Brown is a college 
student in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they really deserve it," Reid said. "They definitely saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
The men have also been honored by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors, the 
county's Peace Officers Assn. and a state firefighters organization. 
</P>
<P>
Donoghue, who works for a Ventura car dealership, said he has received training 
in cardiopulmonary resuscitation and that Lemon is a trained CPR instructor. He 
called the two-minute rescue "one of the most extraordinary experiences in my 
life." 
</P>
<P>
"I feel there is a God, and he wanted us to be there and do what we did," 
Donoghue said. "I don't remember being afraid." 
</P>
<P>
Honey said he will always be grateful to Donoghue and Lemon. "The way I look at 
it," he said, "there's nothing that could repay what they gave us."

Ventura County Superior Court Judge Kenneth R. Yegan was sworn in Thursday as 
an associate justice of the 2nd District Court of Appeal after the Commission 
on Judicial Appointments confirmed his nomination by Gov. George Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
The commission, made up of California Supreme Court Chief Justice Malcolm 
Lucas, Atty. Gen. John K. Van De Kamp and Lester Roth, presiding judge of the 
2nd District Court of Appeal,unanimously approved Yegan's nomination during a

CAWDREY CHALLENGES TERM LIMIT AS 8 OTHERS FILE FOR 2 REDONDO COUNCIL SEATS; 
</P>
<P>
CAMPAIGN: TWO-TERM INCUMBENT SAYS HE'S RUNNING DESPITE THE CITY'S REFUSAL TO 
LET HIM FILE FOR REELECTION. 
</P>

<P>
Redondo Beach City Councilman Ron Cawdrey, who is taking on the city's two-term 
council limit by seeking reelection in March, was confronted with a host of 
challengers Thursday as five candidates filed for his District 5 seat. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey was turned away when he tried to file his nominating papers at the 
close of the filing period Thursday. The rejection was expected, since City 
Clerk John L. Oliver had warned him in a letter earlier this month that he 
could not accept the nominating papers of ineligible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cawdrey, a veteran of eight years on the council, said he will 
campaign nonetheless and will seek a court order mandating that his name be 
placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"I wouldn't even consider dropping out," Cawdrey said in an interview Thursday. 
"They've now pushed it to the point where I've got to find out who's right and 
who's wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The contestants for Cawdrey's North Redondo Beach seat include Bruce Unruh, who 
four years ago set a record for campaign spending in the city, and two local 
activists who have already won endorsements from other elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
For the other open seat on the ballot, Councilman Stevan Colin, who represents 
north-central District 3, will face two opponents in the March 5 election: E. 
Gregory Cox, a resource conservation commissioner who led a drive to prevent 
relocation of two historic homes in Perry Allison Park, and Jack Tyler, who 
lists his occupation as "tax-cutting crusader." 
</P>
<P>
Two of the city's most senior incumbents, four-term Treasurer Alice E. DeLong 
and two-term City Clerk Oliver, will run unopposed. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey has drawn the ire of several council members and Mayor Brad Parton for 
refusing to abide by the City Charter, which voters amended 15 years ago to 
restrict the mayor and council to two four-year terms. Cawdrey has charged that 
the restriction is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, he proposed a ballot measure that would allow voters to 
reconsider the limit. But when sufficient council support failed to 
materialize, he vowed to test the charter in court. 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey estimated that his legal crusade will cost about $10,000. About half of 
this amount has already been donated by local business people and political 
supporters, he said, adding that he has limited individual contributions to 
$500 each. 
</P>
<P>
Among the donors, he said, are Gordon McCrae Jr., executive vice president of 
the Redondo Beach Marina; businessman Steve Shoemaker; and executives of 
Western Waste Industries, a local trash hauler supported by Cawdrey in its 
efforts to obtain an exclusive garbage collection contract in the city. 
</P>
<P>
However, Cawdrey refused Thursday to release a full list of those who had 
donated money for his legal bills, despite being told by the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission that the donations are campaign contributions 
that must be publicly disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
"These are legal funds," the councilman said. "They don't have anything to do 
with my campaign." 
</P>
<P>
Cawdrey said he will keep the contribution lists private until the FPPC forces 
him to disclose them. 
</P>
<P>
The charter dispute aside, the 54-year-old Cawdrey faces stiff competition. 
</P>
<P>
One challenger, 35-year-old businessman Michael Herman, is already being touted 
by Mayor Parton and is expected to win the mayor's endorsement. Another, Public 
Improvement Commissioner Mary Rockwell, 36, is backed by two council members, 
Colin and Barbara J. Doerr. 
</P>
<P>
A third, Unruh -- son of the late state Treasurer Jesse M. Unruh -- spent 
nearly $158,000 in his recent loss to incumbent City Treasurer DeLong. 
</P>
<P>
And a fourth, marketing executive Roberleigh Richester, has been active on one 
of the district's hottest issues -- the problem of cut-through traffic on the 
overloaded residential streets near the TRW office park. 
</P>
<P>
Also on the ballot is retired construction superintendent Joseph White, 63, who 
said he decided to run, in part, because the city's term limit should be 
enforced. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not concerned, because I've done a good job," said Cawdrey, referring to 
the challengers. 
</P>
<P>
But his opponents took issue with that. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think he has done his job for several years," said Richester, 41. "I 
don't know what makes him think the people in this area want him back." 
</P>
<P>
Richester, a 30-year resident of the city, said he decided to run after the 
council failed to follow the recommendations drawn up by the North Redondo 
Traffic Committee, on which Richester served. The committee spent more than two 
years devising a set of alternatives for controlling gridlock on residential 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
"The socioeconomic climate in this district has changed dramatically," he said. 
"The 'thirtysomething' group is settling in and buying homes here, and I don't 
think (Cawdrey's) taken that into consideration. I don't think he's considered 
anything but himself." 
</P>
<P>
Herman, a member of the citizens advisory committee on the city's General Plan, 
also cited traffic as a key issue in the district, along with the fate of the 
former Aviation High School campus, which is slated to become a public park. A 
vice president for Bay Distributors, a Redondo Beach beer wholesaler, Herman is 
an eight-year resident of the city. 
</P>
<P>
White, a 53-year resident and a former superintendent for Anastasi Construction 
Co., a local home builder, said he, too, would work to keep traffic under 
control. He noted that he has not served on any boards or commissions, but 
decided to run for council after retiring this year because "I feel it's time 
to give something back to the city." 
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, a single parent and 12-year resident, cited child care, the 
construction of a new library and the completion of Aviation park as her 
priorities. 
</P>
<P>
Unruh, meanwhile, touted his fiscal experience -- he was his father's campaign 
finance director -- and his ties with the community as a 10-year resident and 
nine-year member of the Redondo Beach Lions Club. He added, however, that he 
plans to spend far less money on this campaign than he did four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Last time, there seemed to be so much sensationalism that the money 
overwhelmed the message," Unruh said. "This time around, I'm going door to 
door." 
</P>
<P>
In District 3, candidates' priorities centered on the local parks and the pier, 
which is undergoing reconstruction after a disastrous series of fires and 
storms in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Councilman Colin, a 33-year-old lawyer who was elected in 1988 to 
fill Marcia Martin's unexpired term, noted that $25 million worth of claims are 
pending against the city, many of them resulting from the 1988 disasters. He 
said the city would benefit from his legal expertise in dealing with the 
litigation. 
</P>
<P>
Cox, a 43-year-old salesman of X-ray equipment, stressed the importance of 
controlling spending on the new pier and the Aviation recreation complex. 
</P>
<P>
And Tyler -- a 29-year-old activist who has for years campaigned unsuccessfully 
to get the city to remove a 6-foot monolith bearing the Ten Commandments from 
the City Hall lawn -- said he wants, among other things, to remove the police 
substation at the pier and have pier businesses pay for their own security.

LEGALITY OF CRA PLAN QUESTIONED; 
</P>
<P>
NORTH HOLLYWOOD: THE REDEVELOPMENT AGENCY'S ARRANGEMENT CALLS FOR USING$5 
MILLION OF ITS OWN MONEY TO BUY LAND FOR A SHOPPING CENTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency has patched together an 
arrangement to preserve endangered plans for a long-awaited shopping center in 
North Hollywood, but a city budget official said Thursday the arrangement might 
violate city law. 
</P>
<P>
The shopping center, which is to include a Ralphs supermarket, is the top 
priority of the North Hollywood Redevelopment Project, an arm of the city 
redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
City officials said Thursday they were surprised to hear of the new plan, which 
calls for the CRA to use $5 million of its own money to buy about five acres of 
land at Vineland and Magnolia for the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
The City Administrative Office is concerned that the new financial plan may not 
comply with a city law requiring that the City Council be notified of 
significant changes in the agency's budget, said Bob Brewer, a top city budget 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
"We're looking into that very issue right now," Brewer said. 
</P>
<P>
The council passed the law earlier this year in an attempt to tighten its 
control of the powerful redevelopment agency. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the council voted to approve a CRA plan to buy about a dozen 
privately owned parcels in North Hollywood and sell the land for $2.76 million 
less than the agency's cost to North Hollywood Partners, a private firm that 
would build the Vineland-Magnolia shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
But two weeks after the council approved the plan, the agency's board of 
directors voted to alter its terms without telling the council of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Don Spivack, CRA director of operations, said Thursday that the new financial 
plan is only an "interim measure" and does not require a review by elected city 
officials. Only if the new plan remained in effect would a review be required, 
Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
Norton Halper, a community activist and adviser to foes of the North Hollywood 
Redevelopment Project, said the CRA had "circumvented the council's oversight 
process" by not informing the council of the change. 
</P>
<P>
Halper also said he was concerned that the CRA's use of its own funds to 
underwrite the Vineland-Magnolia land acquisition might detract from more 
worthwhile CRA projects. 
</P>
<P>
As originally approved by the council Oct. 30, the shopping center financing 
plan called for the CRA to borrow $5 million from Downey Savings &amp; Loan 
Assn. to buy 5.2 acres for the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
North Hollywood Partners would then pay the CRA $5 million for the land and 
build the center, which is to include a 39,000-square-foot Ralphs market, 
29,000 square feet of retail space and a 3,000-square-foot restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
But the CRA would lose about $2.76 million on the deal because it would cost 
the agency about $7.9 million to buy the land, clear it of structures and 
prepare it for development, according to a city budget office report. 
</P>
<P>
But Downey is reconsidering whether to make the $5 million loan, and the CRA on 
Nov. 15 -- realizing then that Downey's money was not forthcoming -- approved 
the use of $5 million of its own funds to carry out the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
The agency had to set aside the money by Nov. 15, the deadline to use its power 
of eminent domain to force the sale of properties from a number of owners who 
are unwilling to sell. The agency's eminent domain powers, under its original 
charter, expire in February and actions were required to begin by Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
A Downey official involved in the loan agreement could not be reached for 
comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
But Spivack said the savings institution pulled back from making the loan by 
Nov. 15 after new federal regulations were enacted that required the S&amp;L to 
conduct its own appraisal of the Vineland-Magnolia property and to study the 
site for toxic deposits. 
</P>
<P>
Under previous federal rules, Downey could have accepted the CRA's own toxic 
review and appraisal of the site. Continued uncertainty about how federal rules 
aimed at shoring up the wobbly savings and loan industry might affect the 
project have made Downey's "willingness to loan questionable," Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
The agency is still trying to get Downey to make the loan, Spivack said. 
</P>
<P>
Questions also were being raised Thursday about whether the new plan, if it 
remains in place, might provide an additional subsidy to the developer. Under 
the original plan the developer was to have paid about half -- more than 
$400,000 -- of the interest and other costs of the $5 million Downey loan. 
</P>
<P>
If there were no Downey loan, there would be no such costs. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the CRA expects to be paid interest by the North Hollywood 
Redevelopment Project for its use of the agency's "internal $5 million loan," 
Spivack said. Spivack said the developer "is willing to make good on the 
interest owed to the agency," but the terms of that agreement have not been 
finalized, he said.

NEIGHBORS SAVE 4 TRAPPED IN HOUSE FIRE; 
</P>
<P>
BLAZE: BYSTANDERS, ALERTED BY CHILDREN'S SCREAMS, PRY OFF SECURITY BARS OVER 
WINDOWS AT A COMPTON HOME.

All Oliver Scroggins could recall seeing as he approached the burning house in 
his Compton neighborhood was "black smoke and the hands of those little 
children, reaching out for help." 
</P>
<P>
Scroggins and several of his neighbors used a discarded plank to pry security 
bars off the windows of the burning house Wednesday afternoon and rescued at 
least four people trapped inside. Four others apparently escaped on their own, 
said authorities, who on Thursday credited the neighbors with helping sheriff's 
deputies avert disaster. 
</P>
<P>
"The heat was so intense that each of us could work at it for only a moment," 
said Scroggins, 29, one of the neighbors who responded to the fire in the 
single-family home at 14822 Cookacre Ave. "But it was one of those things we 
had to do." 
</P>
<P>
Officials said everyone who was in the house was taken to a hospital for 
observation. None was admitted. The fire, which officials say may have been 
started by Christmas tree lights, caused $150,000 damage to the home. 
</P>
<P>
Scroggins said he and another neighbor, Basel Jackson, 33, were across the 
street from the single-story, wood-frame house when their conversation was 
interrupted by screams. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the children," Scroggins said. "They were shouting, 'Help us! Help us! 
Please help us!' " 
</P>
<P>
Heavy security bars -- fastened to the outside of the building with eight-inch 
screws -- blocked escape from the windows at the rear of the house. 
</P>
<P>
"We ran over there, and smoke and flames were just shooting out of everywhere," 
Scroggins said. "Four of them made it out the front, but then the flames 
blocked that, and the rest of them were caught in the back. 
</P>
<P>
"We found an old 2-by-4 lying in the back yard and we used that to pry off the 
bars. We started pulling out kids, and then the officers (sheriff's deputies) 
got there, and they started pulling them out too." 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department identified the officers who 
participated in the rescue as deputies Manci Medina, Christopher Hicks, Matthew 
Dunn and Charles Barton. Spokesmen said Medina and Hicks had to enter the 
burning home to save a 12-year-old girl overcome by smoke. 
</P>
<P>
The victims were unidentified, except for Sandra Washington, an adult who 
police believe was the owner of the home.

WEEKENDER: MUSEUM TIDE-POOL TOURS SHOW WATER AND ROCKS TO BE TEEMING WITH LIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GERALD FARIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At the tide pools beneath the bluffs south of the Cabrillo Marine Museum, not 
all sea life readily meets the eye. 
</P>
<P>
It's easy to spot the strands of kelp and algae that undulate in the wave-fed 
pools. Or you may see a hermit crab using an empty snail shell for refuge. But 
you have to hunt for little sea worms. (They hide under the rocks.) And some of 
those bumps on the rocks aren't rock at all. They're barnacles that have 
cemented themselves to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
Just poking around tide pools and taking in the sea air and ocean views is fun. 
But marine experts at the San Pedro museum say it's a lot more enjoyable if you 
know what you're looking for. 
</P>
<P>
"With education, even people who have been there before notice a number of 
things they've never seen before," said Steve Vogel, the museum's education 
curator. "Maybe they've seen them, but they didn't recognize them as anything 
but part of the rock." 
</P>
<P>
Tide-pool fanciers will be able to get a little of this education Sunday from 1 
to 2:30 p.m. when the museum holds one of its Weekend Tide-Pool Walks, which 
often attract up to 100 people, from children to senior citizens. Museum 
staffers will present a talk and slide show on tide-pool life, then lead people 
on an exploration of the habitat area. 
</P>
<P>
"They have a good time, and the staff is there to share what we find and 
interpret what others find," Vogel said. 
</P>
<P>
Registration isn't required, but warm clothing is advised. Because of the rocky 
terrain, people should wear non-skid shoes. Children under 13 must be 
accompanied by an adult. 
</P>
<P>
The walks are given at low tide periods, and museum Director Susanne Miller 
said Sunday's tide may be the lowest of the year. "Several more feet out from 
the shore will be exposed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Even though the tide pools are heavily visited and sometimes marred by litter, 
Miller said they are "a good introduction to tide-pool life." And unlike some 
pools that require rugged hiking to reach, these are a short walk from the 
museum. Visitors even pass the fossil head of a whale. 
</P>
<P>
Located within the Point Fermin Marine Life Refuge, the tide pools support a 
variety of seaweed and animals that attach themselves to the rocks or find 
refuge beneath them. The area is home to mussels, sea stars, hermit crabs and 
sea hares, which are large sea slugs that look like snails without their 
shells. 
</P>
<P>
There are barnacles that look like tiny volcanoes and others that Miller said 
"look a little like the neck and head of a goose." The pools also have their 
own variety of fish, called sculpins. 
</P>
<P>
The low tide also may provide glimpses of the southern kelp crab. "It's the 
time of the year you see large aggregations of those crabs because they come 
into the area to breed," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
Many tide-pool creatures are small, and Miller said visitors will benefit from 
the museum's expertise. The animals are "subtle, and people . . . will benefit 
a lot from the talk and get a clue as to what to look for," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Tide-pool walks are part of the museum's emphasis on giving people a direct 
experience with Southern California marine life. "We try to get people out 
there to become familiar with the animals in their natural habitat and develop 
an appreciation for caring for them," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
The presentation before the walk will not only highlight tide-pool life but 
show people how to enjoy tide pools without disturbing them. According to the 
museum, animals should be touched gently but not picked up, and rocks should be 
lifted and replaced with care. People also should step cautiously because that 
crunch underfoot could be a barnacle. 
</P>
<P>
"They're especially instructed not to move these animals, as they are sensitive 
to their surroundings," said Miller. Because marine life is protected in the 
refuge, nothing may be collected and taken home. 
</P>
<P>
For some people, Vogel said, the museum walks are an introduction to "what is 
out there on the shoreline. The majority of people go to sandy beaches, and 
tide pools can be a new and unusual experience." 
</P>
<P>
What: Weekend Tide-Pool Walks. 
</P>
<P>
When: Sunday, 1 to 2:30 p.m.; also Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
Where: Cabrillo Marine Museum, 3720 Stephen White Drive, San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Admission: $1; Beach Parking: $5.

CARSON ARRANGES COLLECTION, RECYCLING OF CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For the second consecutive year, the city of Carson has teamed with two private 
firms to recycle Christmas trees. 
</P>
<P>
Residents are being asked to place their trees -- minus ornaments, nails and 
stands -- curbside on their regular trash pickup day Wednesday, Thursday or 
Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
Western Waste Industries, the city refuse hauler, will pick up the trees and 
take them to Kellogg Supply, a Carson-based fertilizing company. The firm will 
grind up the trees to make compost. City officials said last January's pickup 
collected about 8,000 trees that produced 55 tons of compost chips. 
</P>
<P>
Flocked trees cannot be recycled but will be picked up with other garbage.

JAZZ NOTES: P.S. FESTIVAL: DON'T CALL IT DIXIELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though this weekend's Palm Springs Jazz 1990-91 at the Wyndham Palm Springs 
Hotel (888 E. Tahquitz Way) boasts such bands as Jake Porter and the Dixie 
Roadrunners, the Dixieland Express and the Jazzin' Babies, don't let producer 
John McNally hear you call his show a Dixieland event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate that word," says the man who, with partners Libby Huebner and Laurie 
Whitlock, will be running the Saturday-through-Monday festival for the third 
year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather call it classic jazz, which means we're not restricted to music 
simply from the '20s and '30s." 
</P>
<P>
McNally, whom many know from his radio programs on KCRW-FM (89.9) -- 
"Castaway's Choice," which ran from 1984 until last April, and "The More 
Traditional Sounds of Jazz" from 1977-85 -- acknowledges that many of the 
close-to-20 bands appearing on four stages at the event are offering "early" 
jazz. 
</P>
<P>
"But they can stretch their boundaries," he says, "as when the Beverly Hills 
Unlisted Jazz Band does their roaring version of Dizzy Gillespie's 'A Night in 
Tunisia.' " 
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old native of Kent, England, adds that on the schedule are such 
non-traditional outfits as Tom Kubis' Orange County-based big band (featuring 
trumpeter-singer Jack Sheldon), pianist Yve Evans and Finnish artists Antti 
Sarpila and Matti Oiling. Among the unusual trad artists is Spencer Davis, the 
British rock/pop musician who has long embraced "early jazz" as well. 
</P>
<P>
McNally -- who with his partners has formed Classic Jazz Management, a 
California nonprofit corporation -- says that his festival started off as a 
trad -- or, if you will, Dixieland -- event because he had been a fan of that 
style of music since the 1960s trad revival in Britain and it has a solid 
following in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
"Economics dictate you start somewhere and build and we decided earlier forms 
of jazz would be a good base, since the trad crowd spends its year traveling 
from festival to festival," McNally says. 
</P>
<P>
Pre-festival ticket sales are running well ahead of last year's, which 
attracted 2,500 fans, McNally says. He has had ducat requests from 22 states 
and nine countries, including Germany and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
McNally says this is a critical year for his event. "As with any event, the 
third year is really important. If we go up, we're viable, and it looks like 
that's what's happening," he says, adding that he's hoping for 3,000 this year. 
"We're now getting people who say, 'Oh, you're having that festival again? 
Well, we'll want to come this year.' The repetition, as with advertising, 
reinforces the idea in the public's mind." 
</P>
<P>
Still, McNally doesn't foresee breaking even this year -- he and his partners 
lost about $10,000 in 1988 and again in 1989 -- but he is optimistic he will 
with future festivals. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a normal pattern with these festivals that it takes three to five years 
to establish themselves. We believe that when it's been going for a while, it 
will, like the L.A. Classic Jazz Festival, become self-sustaining. And we're 
losing a little less money each year." 
</P>
<P>
The festival lineup also sports Dutch singer Greetje Kauffeld, Chris Kelly's 
Black and White New Orleans Jazz Band with Thais Clark, the Palm Springs Yacht 
Club and the Palm Leaf Ragtime Orchestra and concludes with a gala New Year's 
Eve dinner and dance party. 
</P>
<P>
Information: (619) 322-6000, (213) 799-6054. 
</P>
<P>
Party at Home: You can have a great bash New Year's Eve without leaving your 
front room. Just tune in the American Jazz Radio Festival's New Year's Eve 
celebration Monday from 7 p.m.-1:30 a.m. on KPCC-FM (89.3). 
</P>
<P>
The show begins with a performance by Nina Simone direct from New York's Grand 
Hyatt Hotel, then shifts to Tipitina's in New Orleans, where bluesmen Snooks 
Eaglin, Johnny Adams and Earl King wail from 9:30-11:30 p.m. The party ends, 
and the New Year begins, with a trip to our very own Catalina Bar &amp; Grill 
in Hollywood, where trumpet maestro Freddie Hubbard's quintet, augmented by 
tenorman Ernie Watts, holds forth from 11:30 p.m-1:30 a.m.

JAPAN'S BART SIMPSON: KINDER, GENTLER, CUTER;

<P>
TELEVISION: THE ANIMATED ADVENTURES OF 'TINY MISS MARUKO' HAVE TOPPED THE 
RATINGS AND SPAWNED A 'SIMPSONS'-STYLE MERCHANDISING BLITZ.

Does this script sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
The surprise TV hit of the year is a wacky little cartoon show about a funny, 
middle-class family. The family becomes a national pop-culture phenomenon. 
Posters, T-shirts and other commercial spinoffs pop up everywhere. After a long 
battle, the cartoon drama catches the long-running No. 1 show to become the 
nation's top-rated prime-time program. 
</P>
<P>
That scenario is being played out on both sides of the Pacific this fall as the 
great good fortune of "The Simpsons" is matched here by a spectacularly 
successful cartoon show called "Chibi Maruko-chan," the mega-hit of the season 
on Japanese television. 
</P>
<P>
At that point, however, all similarities between the Simpson household and the 
Sakura family featured in "Chibi Maruko-chan" come to an end. 
</P>
<P>
Where the cartoon Simpsons are sour and cynical, the cartoon Sakuras are sugary 
sweet. Where the Simpsons mock traditional values, the Sakuras glory in them. 
If Bart Simpson ever met Maruko Sakura, the round-faced third-grader who is the 
star of the Japanese cartoon, he would get off a few rude cracks about her 
serrated bangs and pink cheeks, and she would dissolve into embarrassed 
blushes. 
</P>
<P>
The ascent of "Chibi Maruko-chan" -- it translates to "Tiny Miss Maruko" -- to 
the top of the heap in the hugely competitive ratings war here reveals a basic 
secret about Japan. This mighty economic powerhouse, home of samurai and sumo, 
is hopelessly addicted to cute. 
</P>
<P>
While "Chibi Maruko-chan" concerns the daily to and fro of a 9-year-old -- also 
her friends in the third grade, her sixth-grade sister, her parents and 
grandparents -- it is just as popular among adults as it is with elementary 
schoolkids, according to the ratings firm Video Research. 
</P>
<P>
When four 20ish women, all reading Chibi Maruko-chan comic books in a downtown 
Tokyo restaurant, were asked the other day to explain their passion for the 
cartoon, they replied nearly in unison: "Kawa-iiiiii." In English, that would 
be "cuuuuuuute." 
</P>
<P>
Advertisers, consequently, are using the cartoon show to sell everything from 
Barbie-like dolls aimed at preteens to credit cards and cordless phones for 
young executives. Part of the program's success stems from its theme song, 
"Odoru Ponpokorin," an infectious ditty along the lines of "Zip a Dee Doo Dah." 
Released as a record (with Maruko's picture on the jacket, of course), it has 
become the third-biggest-selling single in Japanese history. 
</P>
<P>
The tune is ubiquitous here; it is by far the most popular choice in the 
karaoke, or sing-along, bars where "office ladies" and "salarymen" congregate 
after work. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the record, "Chibi Maruko-chan" has spawned a massive spinoff 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
Sales of the six bound volumes of the comic book featuring Tiny Miss Maruko 
have gone through the roof. Every store in Japan seems to have set aside a 
special section for Chibi Maruko-chan plates, pennants, calendars, ashtrays, 
aprons, candy, games, etc. The Tokyo public prosecutor last week held a press 
conference to announce a raid on a gangster's warehouse full of non-licensed 
Chibi Maruko-chan T-shirts and awnings. 
</P>
<P>
The fervor comes to a head each Sunday at 6 p.m., when millions of households 
tune in to the Fuji Television network for Maruko's weekly adventure. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the appeal seems to be that each episode revolves around utterly 
familiar aspects of Japanese school and family life. The audience sees 
earthquake evacuation drills, teacher visits to the home, students sweeping the 
floors in school, family discussions about how to spend the father's biannual 
bonus and trips to view the spring cherry blossoms and the autumn leaves. 
</P>
<P>
All of this is draped in a thick haze of sentimentality. The days don't always 
go perfectly for Tiny Miss Maruko, but things always work out to a happy 
ending, with the star cuddling up to sleep in her father's lap or running off 
happily with her friends.

'GODFATHER' WINS 7 GOLDEN GLOBE NOMINATIONS; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: FOREIGN PRESS RECOGNIZES 'DANCES WITH WOLVES' AND 'L.A. LAW' BUT 
IGNORES 'CIVIL WAR' AND 'SIMPSONS.'

<P>
Francis Ford Coppola's "The Godfather Part III," Kevin Costner's "Dances With 
Wolves" and such mass-appeal hits as "Dick Tracy," "Ghost" and "Pretty Woman" 
led the nominations for the annual Golden Globe Awards for motion pictures 
announced Thursday morning in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
Although the nominations were widely spread among 32 movies, it was "Godfather 
Part III," with nods in seven categories, that topped the list. 
</P>
<P>
On the television side, NBC's "L.A. Law" led with five nominations, while ABC's 
"Twin Peaks" -- which was mostly snubbed by the TV industry's Emmy Awards -- 
took four. The widely acclaimed "The Civil War" received no nominations because 
there is no documentary category, a Golden Globes spokesman said. And Fox 
Television's highly popular "The Simpsons" was shut out completely. 
</P>
<P>
The Golden Globes are regarded by some in the entertainment industry as a 
weather vane for the Oscars, even though there are only 86 voting members in 
the Hollywood Foreign Press Assn., the Globes' governing body. The Golden 
Globes will be awarded on Jan. 19, during a telecast by Turner Broadcasting 
System. (The Academy of Motion Picture Arts &amp; Sciences' Academy Award 
nominations are due Feb. 13 and will be presented March 25.) 
</P>
<P>
The 86 members representing 46 countries, also nominated "Dances With Wolves" 
in six categories, "GoodFellas" in five and "Dick Tracy," "Ghost," "Pretty 
Woman" and "Reversal of Fortune" in four each. 
</P>
<P>
Warner Bros., which released "Reversal of Fortune" and "GoodFellas," led motion 
picture distribution companies with 12 nominations. Walt Disney Pictures, which 
released "Dick Tracy" and "Pretty Woman," and Paramount Pictures, which 
released "Godfather III" and "Ghost," shared 11 nominations each for a 
second-place tie. 
</P>
<P>
The strong showing by Martin Scorsese's "GoodFellas," follows its double 
victory earlier this month among the Los Angeles and New York film critics 
groups as best picture. That factor, plus the even stronger showings in the 
Globe contest for best movie drama by "Godfather III" and "Dances With Wolves," 
is sure to draw attention to that Globe category as an Oscar indicator. Also 
nominated in that category are "Reversal of Fortune" and "Avalon." 
</P>
<P>
The tightness of the dramatic film competition is further seen in the 
best-director category. With the exception of Barry Levinson's work for his 
personal story of an immigrant family in "Avalon," the four other nominees for 
best motion picture -- drama all received nominations for their directors: 
Coppola, Costner, Scorsese and Barbet Schroeder for "Reversal of Fortune." The 
fifth nominee for best director is Bernardo Bertolucci for "The Sheltering 
Sky." 
</P>
<P>
Coppola's widely awaited "Godfather" sequel to the first two Oscar-winning 
films, garnered nominations for himself as director and as co-writer of the 
screenplay with Mario Puzo. Al Pacino, who portrays godfather Michael Corleone, 
was nominated for best actor, and Andy Garcia, who has won rave reviews for his 
performance as Corleone's nephew and godfather successor, was nominated for 
best supporting actor. 
</P>
<P>
The large showing by "Godfather III" comes following a special screening that 
Paramount Pictures set up for members of the foreign press on Dec. 12 in 
Westwood, hours before the rest of the media was allowed to see the film. 
Coppola himself attended the foreign press showing. 
</P>
<P>
"Dances With Wolves," Costner's frontier epic about native Americans, earned 
him nominations for best actor and best director, plus a supporting actress 
nomination for Mary McDonnell as the Sioux-raised woman who serves as a bridge 
between Costner and the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Pacino is in the unusual situation of being nominated not only for best actor 
as the Mafia chieftain, but also in the supporting actor category for his 
underworld comic role in "Dick Tracy." 
</P>
<P>
Besides Pacino and Costner, the other nominees for best actor in a drama are 
Richard Harris for "The Field," Jeremy Irons for "Reversal of Fortune" and 
Robin Williams for "Awakenings." Williams' "Awakenings" co-star, Robert De 
Niro, was overlooked. De Niro, also was ignored for his starring role in 
"GoodFellas," as was another highly praised performance in that film by Ray 
Liotta. 
</P>
<P>
Best actress nominees for a dramatic film are Kathy Bates in "Misery," Anjelica 
Huston in "The Grifters," Michelle Pfeiffer in "The Russia House," Susan 
Sarandon in "White Palace" and Joanne Woodward for "Mr. and Mrs. Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
In the musical or comedy category for best picture, the nominees include some 
of the biggest grossing films of the year, "Ghost," "Pretty Woman," "Home 
Alone" and "Dick Tracy," as well as the just-released "Green Card." None of the 
year's action/tough-guy pictures, such as "Rocky V," "Total Recall" or "Die 
Hard 2," showed up among the Globe nominations. 
</P>
<P>
In the competition for best actor in a musical or comedy, 10-year-old Macaulay 
Culkin, the besieged kid in "Home Alone," is pitted against such major names as 
Gerard Depardieu in "Green Card," Johnny Depp in "Edward Scissorhands," Richard 
Gere in "Pretty Woman" and Patrick Swayze in "Ghost." 
</P>
<P>
In the television competition, Roseanne Barr, whose top-rated TV series 
"Roseanne" was ignored in the Emmys, was nominated for best actress in a 
musical or comedy series and her co-star John Goodman also received a nod. 
</P>
<P>
In network competition, NBC led with 22 nominations, ABC 19, CBS 14 and Fox 2.

LEANER, MEANER TV NEWS IN THE SCALED-DOWN '90S

<P>
In 1982, at the height of the last recession, reporter Doug Bruckner flew to 
Guadalajara for a local Los Angeles TV station. The assignment was to interview 
California retirees who had moved to Mexico to avoid the high cost of living in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
On that three-day trip, Bruckner was accompanied by a union cameraman, 
soundman, field producer and translator -- even though the field producer spoke 
Spanish. What with overtime, per diem, hotel bills, meals, transportation and 
air fare, Bruckner figures the total bill for a bit of videotape that 
eventually translated into about four minutes of air time on a Los Angeles 
evening newscast was somewhere in the neighborhood of $15,000 to $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner has since worked at all three network owned-and-operated Los Angeles 
TV stations at one time or another. Nowadays, he works harder for a non-network 
evening newsmagazine and on more of a shoestring than at any other time in his 
career. But, on whole, he has learned to be leaner, meaner and -- recession 
aside -- happier. 
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, on a Friday afternoon, the syndicated Paramount TV newsmagazine 
"Hard Copy" bought Bruckner a round-trip ticket to Tahiti. The assignment was 
to cover the funeral of Dag Drollet, Cheyenne Brando's lover who allegedly was 
slain by her half-brother, Christian, in the Beverly Hills home of their 
father, actor Marlon Brando. 
</P>
<P>
Bruckner's boss gave him 10 blank videocassettes and $35 a day per diem pay and 
told him to come back Monday with a story. He did and, according to the 
ratings, it was seen by more people in a single night than saw him on Los 
Angeles TV in a week. 
</P>
<P>
Surviving TV news in the scaled-down '90s will have to be more like the Tahiti 
story and a lot less like the Guadalajara junket, says Bruckner. 
</P>
<P>
"The economics of the business have changed," he said. DENNIS McDOUGAL

AFTER REBUFF, GORBACHEV'S NOMINEE IS OKD

<TEXT>
<P>
In a real Kremlin cliffhanger, the Soviet Parliament hit President Mikhail S. 
Gorbachev with a stunning rebuff on Thursday by rejecting his nominee for vice 
president, then reversed itself to approve the same man when Gorbachev risked 
his political authority to renominate him. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev insisted that he would accept only Gennady I. Yanayev, 53, a longtime 
Communist Party functionary, for the newly created post of vice president 
because he needed a man he could trust at his side. 
</P>
<P>
As lawmakers went to cast their ballots for or against Yanayev on Thursday 
morning, it appeared that this would be just one more case of the Parliament 
giving the Soviet president almost anything he asked for after a democratic 
show of raising objections from the floor. 
</P>
<P>
But two hours later, a collective gasp swept through the Congress of People's 
Deputies, the national Parliament, when it was announced that Yanayev had 
fallen 31 votes short of the 1,120 he needed to be confirmed, although he was 
unopposed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
A hubbub of speculation followed. What would Gorbachev do now? Who else could 
he nominate when he had seemed to have such a hard time coming up with Yanayev? 
</P>
<P>
A grim Gorbachev left little time for doubt. 
</P>
<P>
Saying that he sees the new leadership team he is trying to gather around him 
as a "last chance" group that should certainly be ousted if it cannot bring the 
country out of crisis, he announced: "Once again, I propose the candidacy of 
Yanayev. 
</P>
<P>
"I want a person next to me whom I can fully trust in this important and 
crucial moment," Gorbachev said, in a reflection of the dwindling number of 
close comrades around him. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, one of the Soviet president's strongest allies, Foreign Minister 
Eduard A. Shevardnadze, resigned in an emotional speech warning of a coming 
dictatorship. On Tuesday night, Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, the last of 
Gorbachev's inner circle from the early days of perestroika in 1985, suffered a 
serious heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev, in the tense minutes during the second balloting, told reporters in 
the airy, marble-floored lobby of the Congress that he had wanted to withdraw 
after failing in the first vote but ran again "at the request of the 
president." 
</P>
<P>
Some deputies said they voted against him because he appeared too conservative, 
or had no expertise in economics, or because they were insulted that the 
president had chosen a relative unknown and failed to consult with them. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev himself, however, said he believed that his first try failed in part 
because deputies wanted to express their opposition to the president's policies 
in a reflection of "the political struggle under way in society." 
</P>
<P>
The Congress, the highest authority in the Soviet government, began as an 
obedient political tool for Gorbachev when it first convened in May, 1989. But 
at its fourth session, which ended Thursday, it showed more than ever that it 
has a mind of its own, denying the Soviet president several key measures. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev backers resorted to a powerful emotional onslaught on recalcitrant 
deputies, using pathos, scare tactics and guilt to secure Yanayev's nomination. 
</P>
<P>
David N. Kugultinov, a writer, told the Congress it had put the president in 
the position of a young man who says, "I want to marry a lovely girl, but my 
parents say no." 
</P>
<P>
Nursultan A. Nazarbayev, president of the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan, 
called on deputies to "demonstrate, not only to the Congress and the whole 
country but to the whole world, our support for the president at this critical 
period. Otherwise, what kind of position will we put him in?" 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev racked up 1,237 votes in the repeat balloting, and a sense of palpable 
relief came over the hall. 
</P>
<P>
Looking worn, with his large eyes red and twitching and his salt-and-pepper 
hair slightly mussed, he acknowledged his election with a solemn wave. 
</P>
<P>
"The Congress had scared itself with what it did," Longinas Vasiliauskas, a 
Lithuanian observer at the Parliament, commented. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev, the former chairman of the Soviet Council of Trade Unions, told his 
first news conference as vice president Thursday evening that he would take up 
his duties today. 
</P>
<P>
These are vaguely defined in the constitutional amendment that created his post 
this week, but Yanayev said he planned to concentrate on "questions of the 
economy, the budget . . . and the search for solutions to ethnic conflict." The 
vice president also replaces the president when he is away, but his powers 
during that period are not clear. 
</P>
<P>
Yanayev pledged total loyalty to Gorbachev, saying "the vice president should 
carry out the president's orders, and the president, given his dynamic 
character, can issue any orders."

LUXURY ITEMS SELL BRISKLY IN DAYS BEFORE TAX BEGINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The rich know a bargain when they see one. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, for example, a woman who lives on an out-of-state ranch telephoned 
her jeweler in Beverly Hills. "What should I have before the tax?" she asked H. 
Gordon Chaves, the manager at Laykin et Cie. 
</P>
<P>
He knew exactly what she meant: the new federal "luxury tax" that takes effect 
Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
And he knew exactly how to help. He commissioned photographs of diamonds, 
emeralds, rubies and "several important rings. . . . That sort of thing," he 
said. Chaves rushed the personalized catalogue to his publicity-shy client so 
she could quickly place her order. 
</P>
<P>
In sum, the discerning millionaire or billionaire can save a bundle by buying 
now. Remember, only four shopping days left. 
</P>
<P>
Passed by Congress as a deficit-fighting measure, the 10% excise tax will apply 
to the portion of retail prices that surpasses thresholds for certain 
big-ticket items: $10,000 for jewelry and furs; $30,000 for cars; $100,000 for 
yachts, and $250,000 for airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
For example, a $20,000 necklace will cost an extra $1,000 in five days. That 
$210,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche you've been coveting will be an additional 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
No one is more aware of the closing window of opportunity than those who cater 
to the uppermost of the upper crust. During a dismal Christmas season for most 
of the nation's retailers, many purveyors of tax-eligible goods say that they 
did at least as well as last year -- and in some cases, much better. They 
attribute their good fortune to the levy. 
</P>
<P>
Car dealers, in particular, have been urging customers in person and in 
advertisements to make purchases before the impending tax. They say they are 
getting a good response. 
</P>
<P>
"Tax Beater Buys," proclaims a newspaper advertisement for Century BMW in 
Alhambra. At the showroom of Beverly Hills Ltd. Mercedes-Benz, a sign advises, 
"Last chance to save . . . only 'til Dec. 31, 1990." The sign is perched on the 
windshield of a spiffy $84,580 model, complete with sliding roof, leather 
upholstery and first-aid kit. 
</P>
<P>
"Even our clientele likes to save a little money," said Matt Lindmark, general 
manager of Hornburg Jaguar Inc. on Sunset Boulevard at the west end of the 
Strip. "They are sharp business people." 
</P>
<P>
He said at least six of Hornburg's car sales in December were made to beat the 
luxury tax. 
</P>
<P>
The story is much the same in many of the most exclusive jewelry shops. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yes, there's been a lot of activity because of it," confided a sales clerk 
at Tiffany and Co. on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. He turned his attention 
back to his telephone. He needed approvals for two credit card transactions. 
</P>
<P>
"One is for $24,016.86," he murmured into the receiver. "And the other is for 
$21,600.16." 
</P>
<P>
Up the street, at Fred Joaillier Inc. jewelers, general manager Sergio Baril 
said sales were up 30% over last December. 
</P>
<P>
One regular patron, Baril said, has a wedding anniversary in January. Each 
year, he makes a spectacular purchase for his wife to mark the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
"He likes to buy after the holidays," Baril said. "It's a much calmer time. And 
if you're going to spend that much money, you wait until the last minute to 
squeeze every drop of interest out of it first." 
</P>
<P>
But this year, "he had in mind a six-figure item," Baril said. "He called for 
advice and we suggested that he buy it now." 
</P>
<P>
The sudden surge in sales, however, does not a real boom make. "We're just 
stealing a few sales from January," said Jaguar dealer Lindmark. 
</P>
<P>
Shoppers said Lindmark is right. They explained in interviews that they aren't 
making more purchases this year, just making them earlier. In the guarded 
tradition of wealth, none would give their names. 
</P>
<P>
A captain of the movie industry got a black Jaguar last week at Terry York 
Motor Cars in Encino simply because he wanted a new car. (The old one, he says, 
went to his ex-wife). But he made sure to close the deal before New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had bought that Jaguar Jan. 2, I would have killed him," said a 
penny-wise companion. 
</P>
<P>
A producer said he and his wife were in the market to replace their two 
Jaguars, mainly because their two 1988 models were "depreciating rapidly." He 
said he's buying his wife another Jaguar, but treating himself to something 
else. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't like my Jag," he said. "I'll buy another kind, but I will be buying 
before the first of the year because of the tax." 
</P>
<P>
Some upscale merchants fear that after New Year's Day, their mini-boom will 
turn to a bust. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to hurt our industry terribly," said Sid Klein, vice president of 
Frances Klein Antique and Estate Jewels Inc. on Rodeo Drive. He said Congress 
is discriminating against some businesses that sell to the rich, while letting 
others off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
"For instance, clothes," he said. "A necktie for $125 -- that, to me, is a 
luxury. Or you could buy a designer gown for $10,000. She wears it twice and 
never sees it again. Now that's a luxury." 
</P>
<P>
Some are not so alarmed about an imminent downturn in sales. 
</P>
<P>
"It'll make people think twice," said furrier Merrill Lowell, owner of 
Edwards-Lowell on Canon Drive, who added that several of his customers 
hurriedly bought sables to avoid the tax. But still, he's not worrying. 
</P>
<P>
"Our class of people, the moneyed people, have not paid too much attention. If 
they want it," Lowell said, "they'll buy it."

MINORITY CONTRACT SYSTEM CRITICS BLAME GOVERNMENT; 
</P>
<P>
TRANSIT: SMALL FIRMS SAY THEY ARE VULNERABLE TO ABUSES. CONTRACTORS SAY THE 
LAWS ARE POORLY ADMINISTERED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The goal was noble. After decades of being shut out, small construction 
companies owned by minorities and women finally would be given their fair share 
of work on multimillion-dollar public works projects. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of channeling billions of dollars in subcontracts to these 
disadvantaged firms, a showcase federal program has become a morass of missed 
opportunities, avarice and abuses, its critics say. 
</P>
<P>
The critics include minority subcontractors and big prime contractors alike. 
Both groups contend that government agencies which control the purse strings 
and regulate the process are failing to ensure that legitimate -- and qualified 
-- minority firms are the ones who are benefiting. 
</P>
<P>
"Those agencies should either enforce the (equal opportunity) rules or get rid 
of the program," said one black contractor, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
By federal law, at least 10% of the country's $100 billion in public works 
projects each year should go to "disadvantaged business enterprises." No one 
knows exactly how much money is reaching such firms, but a Times investigation 
of the largest Los Angeles transit contracts found that at least $50 million 
has gone to companies with questionable minority status or companies serving as 
"fronts" for non-minority contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Minority-owned companies complain that they receive unfair treatment when they 
seek work on transit projects such as the $3.9-billion Metro Rail subway, and 
that they risk financial ruin when they try to buck the white, male-dominated 
construction industry. 
</P>
<P>
Transit agencies, minority contractors say, do little to protect their small 
and financially vulnerable companies from exploitation and bullying by major 
contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the work earmarked for minorities goes to companies fronting for 
powerful non-minority contractors, said Oscar Streeter and several other 
minority contractors. And when legitimate minority firms win subcontracts, they 
said, the big, prime contractors attempt to wrest control of the work from them 
and cut into their profits. 
</P>
<P>
"It isn't difficult to get certified (as a minority firm), that's the easy 
part," said Streeter, the black owner of a small South Bay construction 
company. "What you have to realize is that the system you operate in is very 
hostile (to minorities.)" 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the 32,500-member Associated General Contractors argues that 
the minority contracting laws are poorly administered and force them to hire 
under-financed, unqualified minority firms that often cannot finish a job. 
</P>
<P>
The contractors favor an open, competitive bidding system without mandatory 
quotas or goals, said Mike Kennedy, a special counsel for the group. There is 
no effort to exclude minority or female-owned firms, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a terrible program . . . filled with corruption," said association member 
Mike Shank, managing partner of Shank-Obayashi, a Denver-based firm that 
finished two Metro Rail tunnel contracts worth $34 million. "The idea that you 
can parcel out work to people who simply aren't qualified . . . is a recipe for 
disaster." 
</P>
<P>
The minority contracting requirements, he said, put prime contractors in a 
Catch-22: If they do not hire disadvantaged firms, they cannot win public works 
contracts. But "disadvantaged" firms tend to be under-funded and inexperienced 
subcontractors who will need help to do the job. If a prime contractor hires 
such a firm and provides too much help, he risks being accused of setting up an 
illegal front. 
</P>
<P>
Transit authorities alleged that Shank did just that on his two Metro Rail 
contracts. Shank vigorously denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Officials at the Southern California Rapid Transit District -- builders of 
Metro Rail -- acknowledge that the prime contractors sometimes have tried to 
force out minority firms and take over their work. 
</P>
<P>
"We recognize there is a problem because the prime contractors are so much more 
powerful than the subs," said RTD spokesperson Andrea Greene. The problem, she 
said, is "inherent in the industry." 
</P>
<P>
Green said there is nothing that the RTD can do because it does not mediate 
disputes between prime contractors and subcontractors -- and usually does not 
hear about them. 
</P>
<P>
Abuses within the minority contracting program are not confined to Los Angeles. 
Problems with fronting have been uncovered in Seattle, Houston, Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Pa., New York and a number of other major cities. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem is that local public works officials are quick to certify 
disadvantaged firms but then ignore reports of fronting or other abuses because 
of the pressure to meet minority contracting goals, according to federal 
officials. If agencies do not meet the goals, they risk loss of federal 
funding. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of abuse going on in the (disadvantaged business enterprise) 
program," said Rich Ugolow, spokesman for the U.S. Justice Department in 
Washington. "There is a lot of pressure on agencies to participate, so they 
turn the other cheek" to apparent abuses. 
</P>
<P>
When Congress passed the first minority contracting law in 1977, the goal was 
to ensure that at least 10% of the public works projects funded with federal 
money would be subcontracted to disadvantaged companies. 
</P>
<P>
Implementation of the program is left up to state and local agencies, which use 
federal guidelines in deciding whether companies are eligible for minority 
subcontracts. 
</P>
<P>
The requirements for certification as a minority business sound simple enough. 
A firm must gross less than $14.7 million and be 51% owned by a minority person 
or a woman who controls the business and manages the work. 
</P>
<P>
In practice, the federal, state and local regulations governing these programs 
are complex, confusing and often contradictory, critics say. In Los Angeles, 
for example, there are at least a dozen agencies certifying minority companies, 
and records show that sometimes firms found to be bogus or unqualified by one 
agency have been certified by others. 
</P>
<P>
The Southern California Rapid Transit District has certified 371 firms since 
1986. The Los Angeles Transportation Commission, which built the Blue Line, has 
certified 234, including some that are on the RTD lists. Disadvantaged 
enterprises from these lists have been awarded 300 subcontracts worth $471 
million. 
</P>
<P>
There is no way to determine how much of the money has actually gone to bona 
fide companies, partly because the monitoring by transit agencies is deficient 
in a number of ways, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
First, the RTD -- unlike the transportation commission -- does not routinely 
review subcontracts for evidence of abuses. 
</P>
<P>
Second, the agencies do not routinely inspect job sites to determine whether a 
minority subcontractor actually is performing the work. Instead, they rely on 
written reports from the non-minority prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
Because enforcement is weak in Los Angeles, prime contractors have learned to 
skirt equal opportunity regulations, according to an expert on minority 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
Arlene Williams, a vice president of Business Development Center of Southern 
California, a federally funded project to assist minority firms, said the 
system is partly to blame: 
</P>
<P>
When a transit project comes up for bidding, several prime contractors usually 
compete for the work. Each bid lists the minority subcontractors that the prime 
contractor intends to use and the work they will do. The contractor that lists 
the most minorities often wins, even if his bid is higher. 
</P>
<P>
To meet minority contracting goals, some prime contractors set up "fronts" to 
make it appear that they are hiring minority subcontractors to do part of the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
"The bottom line is that (legitimate minority contractors) are being 
effectively shut out," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
If legitimate minority firms are listed as subcontractors, the prime 
contractors often try to renegotiate the prices and the amount of work to be 
done by subcontractors. Some minority firms may be dropped from the project. 
Others may be forced to surrender a portion of the work listed for them. 
</P>
<P>
At least one minority contractor says he is reluctant to even bid again on big 
rail transit jobs because prime contractors are manipulating the system. 
</P>
<P>
"We just can't compete . . . against these fronts," said Otis J. Clopton, 
president of OJB Engineering., a Whittier concrete construction company. OJB 
successfully completed one $2-million rail transit subcontract, but now bids 
for work elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Minority contractors are particularly handicapped by the lack of financing and 
an inability to obtain the performance bonds required by most prime 
contractors, according to Ralph Thomas, executive director of the 3,500-member 
National Assn. of Minority Contractors. 
</P>
<P>
Discrimination in the construction and banking industries has historically 
frozen minority firms out of large public works projects, Thomas said. Yet the 
public agencies that certify these disadvantaged firms offer them no help in 
obtaining financing or bonding. 
</P>
<P>
Once a disadvantaged minority firm wins a contract, it must finance the 
start-up of the project, including hiring crews, buying supplies and renting 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
These small struggling firms are vulnerable to unscrupulous contractors who 
want to force them out and take over the work, Thomas said. All the prime 
contractor needs to do is delay payments for work completed, which deprives the 
minority firm of money to continue the job. 
</P>
<P>
An estimated one-third of the minority contractors bidding on public works jobs 
across the country go broke, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
An industry spokesman agreed that there is an "ongoing problem" of minority 
subcontractors going broke in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
Gary Butler of the Associated General Contractors said prime contractors are 
adversely affected by this because they must find substitute minority 
subcontractors or risk losing minority credits. 
</P>
<P>
The blame, he said, rests with public agencies who fail to test the financial 
resources or abilities of the small companies they certify. 
</P>
<P>
"The result is there are not enough qualified minority firms in Los Angeles," 
Butler said. To remedy this, he proposed training programs and new regulations 
that would allow prime contractors to assist minority subcontractors by renting 
them office space and equipment and by handling their payrolls, for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
"In other words, be helpful," Butler said. "Isn't that what the whole thing is 
about, trying to help?" 
</P>
<P>
Federal guidelines do allow for a mentor relationship between the prime and 
minority subcontractors. However, local transit officials said these 
regulations do not spell out how such an arrangement is to be made. 
</P>
<P>
"The federal regulations are vague and often conflicting . . . and a nightmare 
to administer," said the RTD's Andrea Greene. As a result the line between 
setting up an illegal front and extending a helping hand is fuzzy, she said. 
Neither transit agency has any kind of mentor program. 
</P>
<P>
As for determining which minority firms are qualified to do the work, transit 
officials argue that this is none of their business. They say it is up to the 
prime contractor to determine if a certified minority firm is able to do the 
subcontracted work. 
</P>
<P>
"You certify someone as a (disadvantaged business enterprise), that is all we 
are doing," said Walter Norwood, the head of the RTD's equal opportunity 
program. "That certification doesn't say they are an astute businessman."

BUSH DETERMINED NOT TO DELAY GULF ATTACK; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: HE WILL MOVE QUICKLY AFTER JAN. 15 IF IRAQ BALKS. GIS WILL BE 
INOCULATED AGAINST GERM WARFARE.

<TEXT>
<P>
President Bush, after weighing the political and military consequences of 
further delay, has decided that the United States should move quickly to launch 
a massive military attack on Iraqi forces if Iraq fails to withdraw from Kuwait 
by the U.N.-imposed deadline of Jan. 15, senior government officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Neither congressional nor public sentiment on the issue of launching a military 
offensive will make any difference in Bush's determination to proceed, because 
he believes that delaying an attack much beyond the deadline would increase the 
number of American casualties, two officials involved with Bush in Persian Gulf 
strategy said. 
</P>
<P>
"He's thought about all that, and he's comfortable with his decision," one 
official confided. "He said he's prepared to take whatever the consequences may 
be, including if it's an unpopular war and makes him a one-term President." 
</P>
<P>
In an indication of stepped-up preparations for war, Administration officials 
said the military is planning to begin inoculating some American troops in 
Saudi Arabia against biological weapons. 
</P>
<P>
The officials declined to say how many troops will receive the vaccinations or 
when the program will begin. Biological weapons differ from chemical weapons in 
that they are based on viral agents or other living organisms. 
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq has denied possessing the deadly toxins, U.S. intelligence 
agencies divulged in September that Baghdad has an active biological weapons 
program and is thought to have stockpiled significant quantities of germ 
agents, possibly including anthrax and botulism. 
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials have been concerned for some time that U.S. drug firms are 
not able to produce vaccines in sufficient quantities to provide protection for 
all U.S. troops and allied forces that could be exposed to biological agents. 
</P>
<P>
In discussing the timetable for possible military action, the senior officials 
said Bush realizes that a war with President Saddam Hussein's million-man army 
could last at least a month and probably cause tens of thousands of Iraqi 
casualties and perhaps thousands of American lives. 
</P>
<P>
But they said the President and his aides believe that the American public will 
support a war as long as the United States scores a decisive victory and the 
number of American casualties is relatively low. 
</P>
<P>
The disclosures by the officials come in the face of growing sentiment in 
Congress, especially among Democrats, to delay any military offensive for 
several months or even longer beyond the Jan. 15 deadline in hopes that 
economic sanctions, imposed by the United Nations against Iraq soon after its 
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, ultimately will force the Iraqis to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, 110 House Democrats, led by California Rep. George Miller 
(D-Martinez), sent Bush a letter urging him to allow more time for the 
sanctions to work. 
</P>
<P>
Recent newspaper reports have suggested that the White House is preparing to 
put off any attack against Iraqi troops and installations because of warnings 
by top U.S. military strategists that American troops will not be fully 
prepared for war by the Jan. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Several military officials have told reporters that the United States will not 
be ready for war until about mid-February because the full deployment of troops 
and equipment assigned to the Persian Gulf region will not be in place until 
then. 
</P>
<P>
Similar views from military officials were passed on to Bush by Defense 
Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, during a closed-door briefing after their recent visit to U.S. forces in 
the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, however, senior U.S. officials contradicted that view, saying Bush 
believes that he already has given sanctions enough time and has no interest in 
delaying a military showdown after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
Although one official said Bush realizes that a decision to attack soon after 
Jan. 15 would be contrary to the U.S. tradition of exhausting all means of 
negotiations for a peaceful settlement before going to war, another official 
said: "I think the President can make a pretty good case that he has exhausted 
all rational efforts to settle this diplomatically and he has been rebuffed." 
</P>
<P>
And the President dismissed those reports in a brief exchange with several 
reporters who saw him in a White House hallway during a one-day interruption 
from his holiday vacation at Camp David. 
</P>
<P>
Questioned about his session with Powell and Cheney, Bush said: "I'm not going 
to tell you what they said, but I'm going to tell you, don't believe these 
reports you're reading." 
</P>
<P>
Asked if a compromise might yet be reached with Hussein, Bush declared: "That's 
the problem. Everybody wants me to compromise. There's not going to be a 
compromise with this man." 
</P>
<P>
As the Jan. 15 deadline draws nearer, Bush, Cheney and other U.S. officials -- 
in what appears to be a concerted effort to prepare the American public for war 
-- have stepped up their threats to launch a devastating attack on Iraq if it 
does not withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
But not until Thursday did officials -- who agreed to be interviewed on 
condition that they not be identified -- disclose that Bush is prepared to 
order an attack sooner rather than later after the deadline. 
</P>
<P>
"If war comes, it will be long before mid-February," one official declared. 
"The longer the U.S. waits to attack, the more U.S. lives will be lost." 
</P>
<P>
Said another official: "You must remember that the President's position is that 
this will not be another Vietnam, there will not be a slow escalation while 
Americans die." 
</P>
<P>
The officials said Bush assumes that the American public will be mainly 
concerned about the number of U.S. casualties, not the tens of thousands of 
Iraqis who stand to die or be maimed in a massive air assault, and that even 
the killing of thousands of civilians -- including women and children -- 
probably would not undermine American support for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
"He has to count on the American people being behind him or he wouldn't do it," 
one of the officials said. "Many congressmen are worried about this war, and a 
lot of people still don't really understand the stakes involved, but our sense 
is that Americans will fall in behind the President and expect him to make the 
call." 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, said the official, it will be important for the United 
States to defeat Hussein's forces quickly and decisively because "if the war is 
extended over a long period of time -- with all the television coverage and 
watching people get blown up -- it could cause us serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
Bush told reporters that he does not believe Hussein has gotten the message 
"that we are serious and our allies are serious" about carrying out the U.N. 
resolution demanding Iraq's withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
Referring to Hussein's threats to meet any military attack with a deadly 
counterattack, Bush said: "I read the comments he makes about war, and I find 
it difficult to believe that he believes what will happen to him. I still am 
hopeful he will get the message and get out of Kuwait by the 15th of January 
totally without conditions."

Dismissing as "fully fallacious" an Israeli newspaper's report that Secretary 
of State James A. Baker III will meet with Hussein in Baghdad on Jan. 9, Bush 
said: "There's nothing going on on that front. When there's any news on that, 
I'll be putting it out myself. I am staying directly in touch." 
</P>
<P>
Other sources said that, while no U.S.-Iraqi peace negotiations are under way, 
both the United States and Iraq have been exploring the possibility of a 
Baker-Hussein meeting in Baghdad between Jan. 5 and Jan. 8. 
</P>
<P>
The U.S. position so far has been that it would not agree to scheduling such a 
session for later than Jan. 3 and that, in any event, Baker's mission would not 
be to negotiate but rather to reaffirm the demand that Iraq withdraw 
unconditionally from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The 110 House members who joined an earlier call by Senate Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) to give sanctions longer to work told Bush 
that the U.N. resolution authorizing military action "must not be interpreted 
as an authorization for the use of American forces in an offensive capacity 
against Iraq." 
</P>
<P>
"We note that most of the nations that voted for the resolution made no 
simultaneous commitment of troops, materials or money to support military 
action in the gulf," the lawmakers said in their letter to Bush.

GHOST FLEET CARETAKER NOT READY TO ABANDON SHIPS;

MARITIME BATTLE: HE SAYS THE 66 VESSELS STORED IN A CHANNEL ABOVE SAN FRANCISCO 
ARE READY FOR SERVICE IF THE NATION NEEDS THEM AGAIN. CONGRESSIONAL CRITICS

<P>
Scores of old rusting ships line a channel of an inland bay northeast of San 
Francisco, looming out of the fog like a fleet of Flying Dutchmen condemned to 
sail forever. 
</P>
<P>
And they will, if Charlie Johnston has his way. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional critics want to junk the 66-ship Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, but 
Johnston, caretaker of the "ghost fleet," says that the ships are ready to 
weigh anchor if the nation needs them again. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these ships go back to service in World War II, Korea, Vietnam," said 
Johnston, 40, the fleet's acting superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
During the last session of Congress, the ships here and at Ft. Eustis, Va., and 
Beaumont, Tex., came under fire from the House Small Business Committee's 
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced . . . for these maritime 
cadavers," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), subcommittee chairman. William S. 
Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, described the ships as "glorified rust buckets." 
</P>
<P>
The array of ships that local landlubbers call the "mothball fleet" is 
impressive from a distance, however, and the spookiness that earned it the 
nickname "ghost fleet" is evident while approaching in a tugboat. 
</P>
<P>
They're tied in rows, anchored at the bow and stern and joined to one another 
by gangplanks. Almost all are gray, and rust stains their hulls. 
</P>
<P>
They include the Glomar Explorer, the CIA ship built to retrieve a sunken 
Soviet submarine. Since the secret voyage off Hawaii in 1974, the 618-foot ship 
has been waiting for a new role. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep the Explorer here for the Navy," Johnston said, explaining that the 
Glomar isn't Maritime Administration property, as nearly all the other ships 
are. 
</P>
<P>
You can't visit the Glomar, but the Meredith Victory, dubbed "The Gallant Lady" 
for rescuing thousands of Korean War refugees, can be boarded. 
</P>
<P>
Paint chips litter the deck, leaving metal naked to the elements and rust is 
everywhere. Painters used to keep busy on the fleet, but money ran out in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, to us rust is no big deal as long as the metal is sound," Johnston 
said as he stamped his foot to show the steel's hardness. "If it really got bad 
we could put another plate over it."

POLITICAL SCRAMBLE EXPECTED OVER 7 NEW HOUSE SEATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
California soon will reap a rich political bounty because of the 1990 census, 
but there is no particular joy in either Washington or Sacramento as leaders 
ponder the torturous process they face in carving the state into 52 new 
congressional fiefdoms. 
</P>
<P>
Under the census figures, the Golden State will gain seven seats in the U.S. 
House of Representatives and in 1992 will elect 52 members to the House -- more 
than any state has ever had and about 12% of the entire House membership of 
435. 
</P>
<P>
"This is going to be an ugly, ugly year," one legislative consultant in 
Sacramento said Thursday as he contemplated the political bloodletting that 
could accompany the decennial process of allocating congressional seats on the 
basis of new U.S. Census figures. 
</P>
<P>
Five of the seven new seats will go to Southern California, largely because of 
growth in predominantly Republican suburban areas. The two Northern California 
districts will be needed to accommodate a soaring population in the San Joaquin 
Valley, around Sacramento and in the new suburban communities fanning out east 
of San Francisco Bay. 
</P>
<P>
At the outset, Democrats will be fully in command of the political pie-cutting 
since the Nov. 6 election results gave them increased control of the Senate and 
Assembly, which are empowered to draft both legislative and congressional 
reapportionment bills. The Democrats rule the present 45-seat California 
congressional delegation by 28 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
But standing in the way will be Republican Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, who takes 
office Jan. 7 and has vowed to veto any reapportionment bill that does not 
offer Republicans fair representation within the California House delegation. 
</P>
<P>
The situation is complicated by Proposition 140, the new state term-limits law 
that cuts off the careers of all present state lawmakers in either six or eight 
years and eliminates their lucrative retirement plans. With no future for them 
in Sacramento, ambitious legislators are beginning to covet congressional seats 
as never before. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be some long knives out for the new congressional 
districts," said the Sacramento consultant, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
In the past, the state Legislature tended to defer to California's 
congressional leadership in drawing new House district lines. The late Rep. 
Phillip Burton (D-San Francisco) almost single-handedly drew the present 45 
districts with a primary goal of crafting politically safe seats for incumbents 
and, in one notorious case, creating a district tailor-made for his brother, 
John, stretching across San Francisco Bay to do so. 
</P>
<P>
With Phil Burton's death, the job will pass to Reps. Vic Fazio (D-Sacramento) 
and Howard Berman (D-Los Angeles), working with Reps. Duncan Hunter 
(R-Coronado) and John Doolittle (R-Citrus Heights). In a telephone interview 
from Washington on Thursday, Fazio said Phil Burton was guilty of "a little 
overkill" in fashioning the 1980s congressional districting plan, but that it 
does not favor Democrats as much as many Republicans contend. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Fazio promised "a different approach and style this time, with more 
public involvement and nowhere near as much influence by any one individual, 
more public hearings and probably far more attention given to county and city 
lines." 
</P>
<P>
But Fazio and his colleagues will have to deal with a corps of state lawmakers 
who have an eye on Washington and will try to influence the reapportionment 
process so that the new congressional districts are built around centers of 
their own political strength. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no question that some may want to draw lines for themselves," Fazio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
If an influential legislator does not have a new congressional district 
available, that legislator might work to alter an existing district to make it 
favorable to his own Washington ambitions. Such ambitions are likely to pit not 
only Democratic state legislators against some incumbent Republican members of 
Congress, but also Democrats against Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
The allocation of congressional seats has been a contentious and inherently 
political process ever since the beginning of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Until 1842, many states avoided drawing congressional district lines by 
electing House members at large. But Congress decided this practice violated 
the Constitution's intent of having House members directly and frequently 
accountable to the people in local regions. 
</P>
<P>
For more than 150 years, Congress avoided dispute merely by increasing the size 
of the House of Representatives to accommodate growth and shifting populations, 
from 65 seats in 1789 to 435 in 1910. The final size of the House was not 
established by law at 435 until 1929. The nation went from 1910 until the early 
1930s without any reapportionment because of the ongoing dispute over the size 
of House membership. As a result, the California delegation soared in the early 
1930s by nine seats -- the most ever -- from 11 to 20. 
</P>
<P>
The traditional practice in redistricting is for the state party in power to 
draw district lines that maximize the party's voting clout, usually by dividing 
heavy concentrations of its own party members into separate districts. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, federal laws and court rulings have sharply curbed the ability of 
states to draw lines purely for political advantage. The primary constraint is 
that all districts must contain a similar population with a variance of no more 
than 1% or 2% from district to district. In California, the new districts 
should have an average of about 574,000 residents. With the use of computer-fed 
data from individual census tracts it is possible to draw districts that do not 
vary by more than a few residents. 
</P>
<P>
Compactness also is a criteria. Where possible, entire counties, neighboring 
cities or other recognized communities of interest are supposed to be lumped 
into the same district. 
</P>
<P>
Stretching districts over vast distances to bring in favorable voting groups is 
known as "gerrymandering." In 1812, artist Gilbert Stuart whimsically drew a 
head, tail and wings on the map of a Massachusetts district and declared, "That 
will do for a salamander." Observing this, editor Benjamin Russell added, 
"Better say a Gerrymander," after then-Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry. 
</P>
<P>
Fazio said he and Berman would strive for more geographical compactness in 
1991. Neat district lines are not always possible, Fazio said, but he added, "I 
think there will be less creativity this time." 
</P>
<P>
Another critical factor controlling redistricting is federal voting-rights 
legislation that prohibits any plan that dilutes minority representation. This 
poses a special problem for Democrats who, in the past, have sought to maximize 
the political support of Democratic-leaning minority groups by dividing their 
numbers into separate districts. But clustering large numbers of Latinos, for 
example, into one district will not necessarily guarantee a Latino seat since 
many residents may not be eligible to vote or may not be registered, Fazio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The allocation of seven new seats to California, and the Prop. 140 pressures on 
state legislators to seek longevity in Congress, are not the only factors 
likely to lead to a major shake-up in both the Legislature and California's 
House delegation in the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
Election year 1992 will be the last chance for veteran members of the House to 
retire and keep their campaign treasuries as personal income, an incentive to 
retire after the current term. And both California seats in the U.S. Senate 
will be up in the 1992 election. The prospect of a Senate seat already has 
lured at least two Democratic representatives, Bob Matsui of Sacramento and 
Barbara Boxer of Greenbrae. More House members -- Republicans as well as 
Democrats -- may join the race. They will have to relinquish their House seats 
to run for the Senate. The departure of any House member for whatever reason 
will ease the job of reapportionment drafters, eliminating the pressure to 
preserve a seat for an incumbent. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Naylor, the former Republican leader in the Assembly, has predicted, 
"There will be an unprecedented musical chairs-like scramble as members of both 
houses (Senate and Assembly) seek congressional seats, Assembly members seek 
the vacated Senate seats and some incumbents run against others because of 
dramatic shifts in district lines." 
</P>
<P>
Writing in the California Political Review, Naylor said the partisan effect of 
this will depend on the shape of the new districts. That, in turn, "will depend 
upon the effectiveness of Gov. Wilson in keeping legislative Republicans 
unified enough to strike a bargain for districts that are fair from a statewide 
partisan standpoint as opposed to benefitting incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
But Assembly Speaker Willie L. Brown Jr. (D-San Francisco) has said in 
interviews that the first order of business in drafting a redistricting plan is 
to satisfy as many incumbents of both parties as possible. By doing that, Brown 
might develop a consensus legislative bill that is insulated against a Wilson 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL REAPPORTIONMENT 
</P>
<P>
* What is it? Every 10 years, new U.S. Census figures are used to reapportion 
the 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives among the 50 states to 
reflect relative population gains or losses during the previous 10 years. Under 
the 1990 census, California will gain seven House seats, with its delegation 
increasing from 45 to 52, more than any state has ever had. 
</P>
<P>
* The next step: In 1991, it will be up to the California Legislature to draw 
new Congressional districts to reflect the new seats as well as population 
shifts among the existing 45 seats. Five of the new seats will be south of the 
Tehachapi Mountains and two will be in Northern California. Leaders of both the 
Republican and Democratic House delegations will discuss their desires with 
legislative leaders who will draft the reapportionment bills. The legislation, 
reflecting further census figures that are not expected to be available until 
July, probably will pass sometime in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
* What then? As with any legislation, the reapportionment bill will be sent by 
the Democratic-controlled Legislature to Republican Gov.-elect Pete Wilson, who 
takes office Jan. 6. Wilson has vowed to veto any measure that does not assure 
a fair balance of districts that are likely to be controlled by Republicans and 
Democrats, judged on the basis of current party registration in those areas. A 
compromise plan signed into law by Wilson would go into effect for the 1992 
elections. If there is a veto, the Legislature could override the governor and 
put the plan into effect with a two-thirds vote of each house. Otherwise, the 
Legislature would have to try to come up with another plan acceptable to the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
* What if . . . ? Let's say Wilson and the Legislature cannot agree on a plan. 
Then, most likely, the issue would land in the courts. In such a deadlock in 
the early 1970s, the state Supreme Court drew the lines for both Congressional 
and Legislative seats. In the 1980s, the Democratic governor and Legislature 
agreed on a plan, but Republicans challenged it in the courts. The case was 
finally dismissed in 1989. In the case of a protracted conflict, the courts 
could order 1992 elections held in the old districts or under a new plan with 
the understanding that those district lines could change before the 1994 
voting.

MWD CAN'T FACE FELONY CHARGES, JUDGE RULES; 
</P>
<P>
POLLUTION: ONLY MISDEMEANORS CAN BE FILED AGAINST PUBLIC AGENCIES, HE SAYS. THE 
CASE INVOLVED A CHEMICAL SPILL IN WHICH SIX BICYCLISTS WERE BURNED.

In a controversial decision, a municipal judge ruled Thursday that the 
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California cannot face felony charges 
for a chemical spill in Yorba Linda that inflicted second-degree burns on six 
men who were bicycling in a state park last year. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Daniel T. Brice ruled that public agencies cannot stand trial for 
felonies under a major state environmental law. He added that even if they 
could, there was insufficient evidence in this case to warrant the charges. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, the judge ordered the Los Angeles-based agency to stand trial Feb. 6 
on three misdemeanor counts. The agency is the world's largest water supplier, 
serving 15 million Southern Californians. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe it would be inappropriate for any public entity within the state of 
California to be held on a felony," said Brice, who made his ruling after a 
six-day preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
His decision was immediately disputed by top state water quality officials, who 
wrote and enforce the law. 
</P>
<P>
Andrew Sawyer, assistant chief counsel of the state Water Resources Control 
Board in Sacramento said the state water code prohibits release of toxic 
chemicals into waterways, and is patterned after federal law, which says any 
individual, corporation or public entity can be held on criminal or civil 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
"I wrote that section of the water code and it was clearly intended to apply 
wherever the federal Clean Water Act applies, including public entities," he 
said when told of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Pear also said he believes the judge's decision is 
in error and he is considering an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, Marshall Schulman, the MWD's defense attorney, said he will move 
to have the misdemeanor charges dropped. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they should be prosecuted for anything. That is the bottom 
line," he said, adding that the injuries were the result of an unintentional 
act. 
</P>
<P>
State water officials said the case marks the first time in the nation that a 
public or governmental agency has faced criminal charges of violating 
water-pollution laws. Most cases against polluters involve civil charges. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors and water quality officials allege that the MWD's Diemer Filtration 
Plant in Yorba Linda illegally discharged a caustic chemical into Chino Hills 
State Park when there was a pressure buildup in a pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
From Oct. 26 through Oct. 28, 1989, at least 466 gallons of concentrated sodium 
hydroxide spilled from the Diemer plant into Telegraph Creek, which runs 
through the park, according to a report by the Santa Ana Regional Water Quality 
Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
The spill, undetected by the water agency for almost three days, crossed a 
public bike path. Six cyclists who rode the path said they suffered blistering 
burns on their legs, backs and other body parts and that their mountain bikes, 
clothing and tires were pitted and burned. 
</P>
<P>
Without felony charges, the agency faces a much lighter fine and less of a 
public stigma, prosecutors and environmental officials said. The maximum fine 
for each misdemeanor charge is $25,000 per day, or a total of $75,000 for the 
three-day spill, Pear said. That compares with a possible $1-million fine under 
a felony charge. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm disappointed," said Bruce Paine, a senior engineer at the regional Water 
Quality Control Board who investigated the case. "It's a dramatic difference in 
the maximum liability. It certainly is not as strong a message as the potential 
of a $1-million fine." 
</P>
<P>
The decision calls into question whether the state's major environmental law -- 
the water code -- allows any public agency, whether it is a city, a sanitation 
agency or the military, to be convicted of a felony if it disposes of dangerous 
chemicals illegally. 
</P>
<P>
Brice said he interprets the state law to mean that the Legislature did not 
intend to hold public agencies liable for felonies, only misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
But he added that much of environmental law is uncharted waters, so "I could be 
absolutely wrong and counsel may want to litigate further" in a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors stress that the decision was made by a lower court. Therefore, it 
carries no legal precedent and is not binding to other cases. But environmental 
attorneys and water quality officials worry that it might discourage 
prosecutors from making similar felony prosecutions in the future.

COMMUNITY COLLEGES SUE TO BLOCK ENTRANCE TEST; 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION: FEDERAL LAW TAKING EFFECT JAN. 1 WILL REQUIRE THOSE WITHOUT A HIGH 
SCHOOL DIPLOMA TO PASS AN EXAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
California's community colleges filed a lawsuit Thursday against enforcement of 
a federal law that will require all new students without a high school diploma 
or the equivalent to pass a test screening them for likely academic success at 
the two-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
The 107 community colleges in California asked the U.S. District Court in San 
Francisco to temporarily block the rule, which is supposed to take effect Jan. 
1 as part of a federal budget reduction package. The new law is supposed to 
help cut the default rate on federally backed loans to students who quickly 
flunk out of school and never repay the government. 
</P>
<P>
California has long allowed students, regardless of their past education, to 
enroll at community colleges, and state officials fear that this open-door 
philosophy will be destroyed. The law threatens the colleges themselves with a 
loss of federal funds if minimum admission standards are not set for all 
students, not just those receiving the loans. 
</P>
<P>
"We are asking for an immediate 10-day restraining order to get the people in 
Washington to be fully apprised of how serious the impact is of these 
regulations," state Community Colleges Chancellor David Mertes said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes estimated that 126,000 students are about to enroll for the first time 
at California community colleges after the winter vacation and that 36,000 of 
them would have to be tested over the next few weeks because they don't have 
high school diplomas or equivalency certificates. Mertes said such quick 
screening would be physically impossible and he has told colleges not to refuse 
admission to a student who does not have a high school diploma. Students 
already enrolled would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Moran, director of student assistance programs in the U.S. Department of 
Education, said Thursday that it was premature to respond to the lawsuit until 
government attorneys review it more closely. He said many other community 
colleges around the nation have expressed concern about the law but that only 
the California schools have challenged it in court. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Education Department published a list of tests that could be 
used and invited colleges and private test-makers to submit additional ones for 
review. Moran said Thursday that California community colleges might consider 
adapting tests they now use for placement into various course levels. 
</P>
<P>
Mertes agreed that those tests might be used in the future but not by Jan. 1. 
"Just to contact the students and tell them what is required is a major 
undertaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the California congressional delegation may soon draft legislation 
that would limit the diploma-or-test rule to students receiving federal loans 
and scholarships, according to Mertes. But such a change, he said, "would 
present a major constitutional issue by creating two categories of admissions 
standards."

President Bush has decided that problems caused by postponing military action 
against Iraq outweigh the political and military risks of an early offensive, 
senior Administration officials said. His conclusion is based on the belief 
that delaying an attack much beyond the U.N. Security Council's Jan. 15 
deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait would significantly increase the 
number of American casualties, the officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to concerns expressed by top military officials, the President told 
reporters: "Don't believe these reports you're reading" that U.S. forces will 
not be fully prepared to launch a military offensive action by mid-January. 
"The situation is just right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Company A from the Marines Barracks in Washington, D.C., are being 
sent to the Persian Gulf, the first such deployment since 1906. Company A 
Marines are known for their ceremonial duties as guards at the White House and 
other tourist attractions.

<P>
Diplomatic Front: 
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein told Iraqi ambassadors summoned to an emergency 
session in Baghdad that he is ready for "serious and constructive dialogue" 
with the United States, but he insisted that any talks also address the 
Palestinian issue, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. If talks occur, 
President Bush told reporters, "there's not going to be a compromise with this 
man" over demands that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15.

Thousands of Iraqi women and children demonstrated outside the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad to protest the forced diversion of an Iraqi cargo vessel carrying food 
bound for Iraq.

The largest U.S. amphibious task force to leave the Pacific Coast in 25 years 
arrived in the Philippines on Thursday on its way to bolster allied forces in 
the Persian Gulf, the U.S. 7th Fleet said. 
</P>
<P>
A 7th Fleet announcement said the armada of 13 combat ships staged simulated 
amphibious assaults before arriving at Subic Bay Naval Base, 50 miles northwest 
of Manila. 
</P>
<P>
It described the armada as "the largest amphibious task force to leave the 
shores of the West Coast of the United States since 1965."

A group of senior Iraqi diplomats were dispatched back to their overseas posts 
Thursday, and the government said it is ready for "serious and constructive 
dialogue" to avert war. But officials denied that Iraq is launching a new peace 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's foreign minister said it is too late for peace initiatives in the 
Persian Gulf, maintaining that only military force will dislodge Iraq from the 
oil-rich emirate that it invaded Aug. 2. 
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, with less than three weeks remaining before the Jan. 15 U.N. 
deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein met 
with 20 diplomats who had been recalled to Baghdad, diplomats said on condition 
of anonymity. They included Iraq's envoys to the United States, the Soviet 
Union and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for a serious and constructive dialogue based on mutual respect 
and the rejection of the course of hegemony and arrogance which the American 
Administration tries to impose on us," the state Iraqi News Agency quoted 
Hussein as telling the diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
But Hussein repeated his demand to link an Israeli withdrawal from the West 
Bank and Gaza Strip with any Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, the diplomats said. The 
United States has rejected any such linkage. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein showed little willingness to compromise on the issue. Iraq is "ready to 
take any sacrifice for the battle it wages against the United States and its 
allies," the news agency quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq also denied reports surfacing in recent days that Hussein was preparing a 
diplomatic initiative ahead of the Jan. 15 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
The diplomats said the envoys were beginning to leave Iraq on Thursday to 
return to their posts overseas. 
</P>
<P>
Hussein met with Soviet Deputy Prime Minister Igor Belousov about the gulf 
crisis on Thursday, the Tass news agency said in Moscow. Belousov was also 
arranging for Soviet citizens remaining in Iraq who want to leave to be 
evacuated by Jan. 10. There were no other details on their discussions. 
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al Ahmed al Sabah, said that only 
military force will dislodge Iraq from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole world has given enough time for a peaceful settlement of the gulf 
crisis," Sabah told a news conference during a visit to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether by the Arab world, whether by the friendly countries, whether by the 
Third World countries or by the big powers, it is very late for such (peace) 
initiatives. It would not be useful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, thousands of women and children marched past the U.S. Embassy in 
Baghdad on Thursday to protest the boarding and diversion of a "peace ship"' 
bound for Iraq in defiance of an international blockade. 
</P>
<P>
The freighter Ibn Khaldoon was boarded off Oman on Wednesday by U.S. sailors, 
who scuffled with passengers and crew. 
</P>
<P>
The ship, with 200 women peace activists and others aboard, was carrying sugar, 
rice, cooking oil and other cargo banned under U.N. sanctions against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Transport Minister Mohammed Hamza al Zubeidi accused the boarding party 
of beating the women activists. But a U.S. Navy spokesman said no evidence of 
injuries was found. 
</P>
<P>
The Ibn Khaldoon was being escorted to an undisclosed destination after the 
interception.

LIGHTLY ARMED MARINES COULD GET CHEWED UP, SOME EXPERTS FEAR; 
</P>
<P>
MILITARY: MOBILE UNITS DESIGNED FOR QUICK STRIKES ARE ILL-SUITED TO TAKE ON THE 
ENTRENCHED IRAQIS, ANALYSTS SAY.

<P>
When the United States needed to move quickly to block a potential thrust by 
Saddam Hussein into Saudi Arabia, highly mobile Marine units were able to take 
up defensive positions in the desert within days to ensure that any Iraqi 
advance would be difficult and costly. 
</P>
<P>
But almost five months later, with the battle of Kuwait taking shape as a 
collision between two huge war machines, the presence of 50,000 Marines in the 
desert is beginning to stir questions among some in the defense community. 
</P>
<P>
Positioned beside heavy Army units on the allied "line in the sand," the rapid 
deployment Marine troops face an armored Iraqi force across the border that has 
more and heavier tanks and greater firepower. And that force is becoming better 
entrenched by the day. 
</P>
<P>
Unless the lighter-equipped Marines are pulled back and repositioned for their 
brand of quick amphibious assaults against the enemy, some defense analysts and 
former military officials fear, they could be chewed up in a large-scale land 
battle for which they are ill-suited. 
</P>
<P>
"Certainly Marine M-60 tanks would be no match for Iraqi (Soviet-made) T-72s," 
said retired Lt. Gen. William Odom. "And their doctrine says not to go deeper 
than 10 or 20 kilometers off the beach because their log (logistic) train is at 
sea," added the former Army intelligence chief, who is now at the Hudson 
Institute, an Indianapolis think tank. 
</P>
<P>
Questions about the Marines' mission are one part of the debate simmering in 
the ranks of current and former military people about the U.S. strategic 
position as the U.N. Security Council deadline of Jan. 15 approaches for Iraq 
to withdraw from Kuwait or face possible military action. 
</P>
<P>
Many are quick to point out that U.S. commanders in the Persian Gulf, fully 
aware of their troops' relative strengths and weaknesses, would not use the 
Marines in a way that would magnify a mismatch. However, the disproportionate 
casualty rates the Marines suffered in Vietnam underscore the gravity of the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
In that war, where Marines were used as front-line soldiers, they suffered more 
than twice the Army's dead and wounded rate, according to figures from the Army 
Center of Military History. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, of every 1,000 soldiers serving in Vietnam, seven were 
killed, as compared to 16 Marines. And for every 1,000 soldiers, 29 were killed 
or wounded, compared to 81 Marines. 
</P>
<P>
To the argument that the Marines in Saudi Arabia would be drastically 
overmatched, ex-Marine officers offer several rebuttals, although they admit 
that the Army is better equipped and trained for hard-slogging ground warfare. 
</P>
<P>
An Army armored division, for example, has six times more tanks, and more 
modern types, than the typical Marine division. The Marine division now in 
Saudi Arabia, situated in the desert between Saudi troops and an Army armored 
division, has twice the usual number of tanks, but its armor remains 
considerably inferior to its Army neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
One ex-Marine argued, "To the Marines, tanks are just an adjunct -- just one of 
the weapons we have," while "the Army guys in armored divisions eat, sleep and 
breathe tank warfare." 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.), who was a Marine combat officer in Vietnam, 
argued that the casualty statistics there probably reflect "the fact that a 
greater percentage of Marines were in front-line combat," while the Army had a 
high proportion of soldiers holding terrain or in logistics support units. 
</P>
<P>
"If you compared Marines to the (Army's) 82nd Airborne or 1st Cavalry 
(divisions), I bet they'd be about the same," Robb said last week, referring to 
the Army units that saw the most combat in Vietnam. Such a breakdown was not 
available from the Center of military History or the National Archives, 
however. 
</P>
<P>
Robb, who recently visited the Persian Gulf, acknowledged that he has "some 
reservations" about deploying Marines on the ground in ways that reduce their 
flexibility and create additional logistic supply difficulties. But he is 
confident, he said, that U.S. generals in Saudi Arabia "appreciate the strength 
and weaknesses of forces, American and allied, under their command." 
</P>
<P>
A senior Marine general, now retired, complained that comparing a Marine 
brigade to an Army armored division "is comparing apples and oranges." Both can 
have roughly the same number of personnel (about 15,000), but they are 
"different tools," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure, if you have to go into a tank battle, or go 150 miles deep, I'd take an 
Army armored division or mechanized infantry division over the (Marine) 
amphibious assault force," he said. "But I'd also take them over the Army 
airborne. That's not what Marines or Army airborne were designed for. 
</P>
<P>
"The airborne is for dropping behind enemy lines, and the Marines are for end 
runs," he continued. "Like at Inchon (the amphibious landing during the Korean 
War), where we saved the day." 
</P>
<P>
Another retired Army general, also a Vietnam veteran, noted that the Army's 
airborne divisions are equipped even more lightly than the Marines in terms of 
tanks and artillery. These parachute troops, also deployed at the front in 
Saudi Arabia, appear as vulnerable as the Marines and also ill-suited for 
straightforward ground offensives, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"With airborne, there's a rule of thumb -- you've got about 72 hours to get in 
there and relieve them (after they are dropped), or you lose them," he 
explained. These shock troops can't sustain heavy fighting within enemy lines, 
so the main force must break through to them within about three days. He viewed 
the role and limits of Marines in similar fashion. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't imagine that (Gen. H. Norman) Schwarzkopf (who commands U.S. troops in 
the gulf) would want to use Marines for deep penetration missions overland when 
he has those armored divisions," said the ex-Marine general. 
</P>
<P>
Then why not pull them out? "Politics," according to one former Army officer. 
"The Marines have a large and effective lobby in Congress, like (former 
Marines) Chuck Robb and John Glenn (D-Ohio) in the Senate," he said. In a time 
of shrinking defense budgets, every service wants to demonstrate its merit to 
forestall deep funding cuts in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
The Army and Marine Corps have always argued about "roles and missions," but 
the Army chief of staff, Gen. Carl E. Vuono, and the Marine Corps commandant, 
Gen. Alfred M. Gray, have reportedly had more heated exchanges than their 
predecessors over which service can best provide the United States with light, 
fast, mobile forces in the future.

The Israeli Supreme Court temporarily barred the expulsion of four Palestinians 
suspected of being leaders of the Muslim fundamentalist Hamas movement in the 
occupied territories. Lawyers for the four, from the Gaza Strip, had argued 
that the expulsions would violate the Fourth Geneva Convention on treatment of 
prisoners under occupation. The expulsions will be delayed until the court 
completes its deliberations.

GIRL, 3, FOUND CLINICALLY DEAD IN SNOW, IS REVIVED

A 3-year-old girl who was revived after wandering outside and being found 
clinically dead in a snowdrift was well enough Thursday to sit up in her 
hospital bed and fuss at her nurses. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Children's Hospital said that Brittany Eichelberger was alert, 
suffering from frostbite of her hands and toes and congestion in her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
"When we first took her to the hospital, I didn't think she had a chance 
because she just looked so bad," said Brittany's mother, Melinda Eichelberger, 
20. "Now, she's fighting with the nurses, telling them to get away." 
</P>
<P>
The blond, blue-eyed child was found lifeless in the snow early Monday, 
apparently several hours after she had wandered outside her Elkins, W. Va., 
trailer home, wearing only her underwear and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
Eichelberger speculated that the child was enchanted by the snow and ran 
outside to build a snowman for her grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
Brittany is breathing and eating on her own, Dr. Shekhar Venkataraman, her 
physician, said. Frostbite could cause her to lose the tips of her fingers and 
toes, and it will be "some time" before doctors determine if there has been any 
brain damage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors estimated that Brittany had been outside for two to three hours. Her 
temperature had dropped to 74 degrees, causing her heart to stop -- apparently 
minutes before her mother found her. 
</P>
<P>
In the absence of oxygen, the severe cold helped preserve her brain function, 
Venkataraman said. 
</P>
<P>
Eichelberger and her fiance, Steve Robinson, found Brittany about 10 yards from 
the home. A neighbor, Paul Owens, administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation 
until paramedics arrived. 
</P>
<P>
Doctors at Davis Memorial Hospital in Elkins continued CPR for 3 1/2 hours 
until Brittany's temperature rose. They also began warming the girl by wrapping 
her in blankets, exposing her to warm lights and pumping a warm saline solution 
into her stomach. 
</P>
<P>
She was flown to Pittsburgh Monday evening. Her mother said Brittany was able 
to speak to her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
"Her voice was real hoarse, but I was excited. I was afraid she wasn't going to 
be able to talk," Eichelberger said. "She says 'no,' 'mommy,' 'get' and 'stop.' 
"

State wildlife officials in Helena, Mont., put off a decision on a plan for 
federal wardens and state rangers to kill bison that wander out of Yellowstone 
National Park to ensure that they do not spread disease to cattle. 
</P>
<P>
About half of the 2,500 to 3,000 buffalo in the park are believed to carry 
brucellosis, which causes cattle to abort. Animal rights groups contend the 
threat of the bisons' passing the disease to domestic cattle is minimal, but 
Montana ranchers say the invading bison should not be allowed even the 
slightest chance to contaminate rangeland. Montana spent millions of dollars 
over a decade to eradicate brucellosis.

The Food and Drug Administration said it will test raw milk weekly around the 
nation to determine if it contains certain antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
The agency said that 250 sites will be designated for testing, and randomly 
selected raw milk samples from five sites will be tested each week. The tests 
will look for the presence of eight sulfa drugs and three tetracycline drugs. 
The FDA said when residues are found, the states will be told and the agency 
will help track down the source. Antibiotics are often used by veterinarians to 
treat infections in dairy cattle. Testing is conducted to determine if residues 
from the drugs are present in the milk.

Union leaders promised they now will turn the battle for regulation of 
computers in the workplace to the state and federal arenas. Agnos agreed to 
sign the measure after prodding labor and business leaders to compromise on 
amendments that will make the ordinance less costly for businesses and extend 
to four years, from two, the time they would have to comply fully. City Atty.

GENE CALLAHAN; OSCAR-WINNING SET DESIGNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Academy Award-winning art director and set designer Gene Callahan, praised for 
his warm, often elegant settings in more than 50 movies and 1,000 television 
programs, has died at 67. 
</P>
<P>
He died Wednesday at his home in Baton Rouge, La., of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan won an Oscar in 1961 for his set-designing work in "The Hustler," 
starring Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason, and in 1963 for art direction in 
"America, America." He received a third Academy Award nomination in 1963 for 
"The Cardinal" and a fourth in 1976 for "The Last Tycoon." 
</P>
<P>
Callahan, a Baton Rouge native, once described his work in an interview with 
the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
"As a production designer, I am responsible for the 'look' of the show -- from 
locations, or exterior scenes, and how they are to be shot, to the design (of 
the) sets themselves, their constructions, their painting, and then the set 
decoration. Sometimes I design the titles too." 
</P>
<P>
His work ranged from building a village in Greece to painting a mountainside a 
different shade to building shores in Turkey. 
</P>
<P>
Callahan, who began his career in the 1940s designing opera sets at Louisiana 
State University, recently worked as production designer for the movie "Steel 
Magnolias," shot in Natchitoches, La. 
</P>
<P>
He also was a production designer for such films as "The Group," "The Magic 
Garden of Stanley Sweetheart" and "The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon 
Marigolds." 
</P>
<P>
As set decorator, his many film credits included "Butterfield 8," "Splendor in 
the Grass," and "Long Day's Journey Into Night." 
</P>
<P>
As art director, he earned film credits for "Funny Girl," "The Stepford Wives," 
"Julia," "The Eyes of Laura Mars," "Seems Like Old Times," "Whose Life Is It 
Anyway?" "Grease II," "Places in the Heart" and "Children of a Lesser God."

PADRES' SANTIAGO ARRESTED, CLAIMS POLICE BEAT HIM 
</P>

<P>
Padre catcher Benito Santiago was arrested Sunday night on suspicion of driving 
under the influence of alcohol and resisting arrest after an incident during 
which the player alleged he was beaten by three police officers. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado Police Dept. spokesman Detective Keith James said Santiago was booked 
for DUI and resisting arrest. Ed Checkert, deputy district attorney in the 
South Bay office, said charges have not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said Thursday night he was innocent and said he sustained a black eye, 
a scratch on the side of his face, a sore neck and a sore forearm. 
</P>
<P>
Ishmael Fonseca, the arresting officer, was unavailable for comment. Sgt. James 
Adams, a shift supervisor who said he was familiar with the case, said Santiago 
was not mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
"What our guys did was right," Adams said. "Benito pushed it." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Boras, Santiago's agent and lawyer, said Thursday night that he is 
uncomfortable with the way the matter was handled. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire case will be reviewed succinctly by myself and our legal 
department," Boras said, "and (police) conduct will be scrutinized in 
accordance with provisional rules and regulations governing the conduct of 
police officers in that situation. If after review we find their conduct not 
within those standards, we will definitely pursue litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Adams: "Let's go to court. When the situation comes out in court, I think 
you'll find what Benito said is not accurate, and we'll prove it. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a free country. People can say what they want. Let Benito say whatever he 
wants. He's a public person." 
</P>
<P>
Adams went on to say he anticipated the matter will end up in court. 
</P>
<P>
"Sure," he said. "That's what most people in his condition do, go to court. 
People making $1 million a year. Zsa Zsa Gabor went to court, didn't she?" 
</P>
<P>
Padre President Dick Freeman said he knew nothing about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of it," Freeman said. "I've got no comment." 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said the incident occurred after he stopped his car to try to assist 
his sister and daughter, whose vehicle had been pulled over by police. 
</P>
<P>
According to James, who said he was reading from the police report, Santiago 
was arrested at 11:33 p.m. Sunday in the area of the Coronado Toll Plaza as he 
was traveling eastbound. 
</P>
<P>
"It appears that another vehicle was stopped for a traffic violation and the 
vehicle driven by Santiago pulled over and got involved in the stop the officer 
made on the other vehicle," James said. 
</P>
<P>
James said it was determined at that time that Santiago was under the influence 
of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
"After he resisted arrest, he was subdued, taken into police custody and taken 
to the police department." 
</P>
<P>
He was then booked in the County Jail and released about four hours later. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, 25, said he and his wife, Blanco, were leaving Coronado in one car 
and his sister, Eneida, 42, and daughter, Benny Beth, 5, were following him in 
another car. He said that they had just had dinner at his family doctor's house 
in Coronado and were on their way home to Chula Vista when Eneida's car was 
stopped by the police. 
</P>
<P>
According to Santiago, he also stopped because Eneida does not speak English. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to find out what's wrong," Santiago said. "They said, 'Stay inside your 
car.' I told the guy, 'I don't want no trouble.' A couple of minutes later, one 
more car came up." 
</P>
<P>
Boras said Santiago told him: "He went (to his sister's car) because he wanted 
to get his daughter because she was crying. The officer told him to get back in 
(his) car and he went back to the car and waited. The officer called a back-up, 
and Benito said he got out of the car to see what was going on . . . his 
daughter was still crying in (his sister's) car. That's when the three officers 
pushed and grabbed him and arrested him." 
</P>
<P>
Adams said Santiago's sister -- whom all parties agreed was the person who was 
first pulled over -- was neither arrested nor charged with anything. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said he was given a blood test after his arrest but was not given 
results. 
</P>
<P>
Boras, meanwhile, said he can't understand why Santiago was arrested on 
suspicion of drunk driving because he was never observed driving the car by 
police officers. 
</P>
<P>
"He was never pulled over by police officers," Boras said. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago, who has been with the Padres since he breaking into the major leagues 
in 1986, was selected to last summer's National League All-Star team but 
couldn't play because of a fractured left forearm. He played in 100 games and 
finished the season batting .270 with 11 home runs and 53 RBI. 
</P>
<P>
It was his best year since 1987, when he had a 34-game hitting streak and was a 
unanimous choice for NL Rookie of the Year. He batted .300 that year with 18 
homers and 79 RBIs.

DAVE DISTEL: CHARGERS MOVING IN WRONG DIRECTION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Just take a little time off during the holidays and watch the news pile up . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
So the Chargers went and did what the fans have been clamoring for them to do. 
They changed their starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
But not to Mark Vlasic, the No. 2 guy who made that cameo start in the season 
opener at Dallas. Maybe it would have been too logical to give him another 
opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
They've changed to John Friesz. 
</P>
<P>
What a minute, I may be stuffed after Christmas, but I am not suffering from 
the fuzziness that occasionally comes with New Year's Day. I can see and I can 
hear and I can think, and I don't think I believe what I am hearing and seeing. 
</P>
<P>
John Friesz? 
</P>
<P>
Undoubtedly, a fine young man. 
</P>
<P>
Arguably, a potentially fine young quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
In reality, raw as steak on the hoof. 
</P>
<P>
Al Davis must have spiked the egg nog when the Charger staff sat down Christmas 
Eve to work on the game plan for Sunday's season finale in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
How else to explain that a rookie with nary a practice snap with the Charger 
offense since the exhibition season gets his first start in what could be a 
very meaningful game? 
</P>
<P>
If Kansas City wins Saturday in Chicago, a victory by the Chargers would give 
the Chiefs the AFC West championship. The Chargers should prepare Tolliver as 
well as Friesz and start Tolliver if the game has a bearing on the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
Forget that the fans are applauding this switch. When I moved to San Diego in 
1978, fans were debating whether the Chargers should be quarterbacked by Dan 
Fouts or James Harris. It's a good thing that one did not go to a vote, because 
Fouts' 1977 holdout made him about as popular hereabouts as . . . say Billy Joe 
Tolliver . . . 
</P>
<P>
When last I checked, the Padres' Christmas stocking had gaping holes at third, 
left and center. 
</P>
<P>
So Santa Claus brings them a right-handed relief pitcher. His name is Larry 
Andersen and he is 37 years old. He will be making $2.2 million a year until he 
is the age Jack Benny always made fun of. 
</P>
<P>
In truth, the Padres needed a right-handed relief pitcher. In today's market, 
this guy was probably a cheap way to fill a void. 
</P>
<P>
However, should this new ownership group not have the financial wherewithal to 
shop deluxe for its biggest needs, why didn't it go to a second-hand store and 
see if Hoyt Wilhelm was interested in coming out of retirement? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe Tom Werner is going to surprise us and merge his highest-priced talent. 
That could mean Bill Cosby at third base and . . . voila . . . Roseanne Barr 
covering both left and center. 
</P>
<P>
By herself. 
</P>
<P>
Without moving . . . 
</P>
<P>
Aren't going to places like Bloomington, Ind., to play basketball supposed to 
be excellent opportunities for gaining experience? 
</P>
<P>
You don't expect to win against Indiana, but you come away better for having 
been there. 
</P>
<P>
Tell it to USD. 
</P>
<P>
Since losing at Indiana, 91-64, the Toreros have stumbled on the road against 
UC Santa Barbara, 72-63; Cal State Northridge, 83-73; and Eastern Washington, 
73-69. UC Santa Barbara figured to be a test, but the others should have been 
nothing more than nutritional supplements to the win column. 
</P>
<P>
If you are dreaming of a West Coast Conference championship and a trip to the 
NCAA tournament, you beat Northridge and Eastern Washington . . . anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
Those should have been road wins rather than road kills . . . 
</P>
<P>
With USIU's athletic program staggering toward a possible demise, an old 
theoretical question comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
If a tree falls in the woods and no one is there to hear it, does it make a 
sound? 
</P>
<P>
Athletics would be missed by the players and coaches and maybe even the 
secretaries, if they have any, and it would be a shame for them. It's a shame, 
of course, when anyone is put out of work and, more so, when youngsters are 
deprived of an opportunity to "play" their way to an education, assuming they 
are into the educational part of the equation. 
</P>
<P>
But this program would go under with barely a whimper of notice beyond the 
eucalyptus-lined roads of USIU's Scripps Ranch campus. 
</P>
<P>
In this community, which follows its largest university with chilling apathy, 
USIU athletics never really had a chance . . . at least at the Division I level 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
Playing as well as it did at the end of the season, San Diego State's football 
team would have fared quite well in maybe half of the 19 bowl games this year. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Al Luginbill can probably talk about bowl aspirations in 1991 without 
being considered quite the lunatic he was considered when he expressed such a 
notion this year. 
</P>
<P>
Dan McGwire, the departing quarterback no less, thinks the Aztec offense will 
be as good as it was this year. If he is not being outrageously optimistic, the 
Aztecs can become bowl contenders if they can make only reasonable progress on 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
One more thing, of course, is that San Diego fans must turn out in sufficient 
numbers to show an interested bowl there is community support. That may be 
tougher than building the defense.

SEAU SHOWS WHAT'S INSIDE REALLY COUNTS

<P>
His metamorphosis from misplaced linebacker to Pro Bowl alternate has been lost 
in the rubble of another season to forget. 
</P>
<P>
A few more victories, an attention-getting playoff berth, and instead of laying 
low, Junior Seau might be taking a bow today. 
</P>
<P>
You remember Junior Seau, the bitter, sullen, mistake-prone Junior Seau. He was 
the woe-is-me first-round pick who grudgingly signed a $4.525-million contract 
to play for his hometown Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
He began his National Football League career in a pout. Early in the season he 
had more penalties than he did tackles. The fans in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium booed him, and then the opposition ran right by him. 
</P>
<P>
"How low is low?" Seau said. 
</P>
<P>
Disaster, however, eventually gave way to gradual improvement: A proper read 
here, a tackle there. 
</P>
<P>
"Accepting my role as an inside linebacker was the big thing," Seau said. "No 
more glory. It was hard to get rid of the glory years on the outside. It was 
hard to let go." 
</P>
<P>
Junior Seau's pursuit of glory has been relentless. It drove him hard at USC, 
where he piled up 19 sacks as a junior. It pushed him to train and work harder 
than most any other draft-eligible player, and prompted his draft-day value to 
rise dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
Glory suits Junior Seau. It makes him happy. Makes him cocky. And in an 
appealing boys-will-be-boys way, it makes him unbearable. 
</P>
<P>
"He's giving me a ration of grief, because he's playing out of position and 
he's in his first year and he's selected to be an alternate to the Pro Bowl," 
linebacker Gary Plummer said. "He's telling me he's gotten what I've been 
trying to get for the last eight years. 
</P>
<P>
"So I go over and get two glasses of water and throw them on him to cool him 
down." 
</P>
<P>
A glorious shower. An inspiring affirmation of what defensive coordinator Ron 
Lynn has been trying to tell him for the past four months: "There is glory to 
be found as an inside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"He can be a glamour player, the glamour player in the league where there are 
no glamour players," Lynn said. "Who do you talk about when you talk about 
inside linebackers? (Miami's) John Offerdahl? (Detroit's) Chris Spielman? 
(Chicago's) Mike Singletary? 
</P>
<P>
"This guy can be all those guys and much, much more. He also has the ability 
when all else is said and done to get into our four-down linemen scheme and 
rush the passer. He offers the best of both worlds." 
</P>
<P>
However, none of it has happened as quickly as Seau had planned. By his 
calculations, he was on his way into the Hall of Fame as soon as he donned the 
shoulder pads for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
"He expected to play like Superman," Lynn said. "But you take (Seattle's) 
Cortez Kennedy and (Tampa's) Keith McCants, and tell me who has had the most 
impact on their team? I don't think it's even close. Junior is light years 
ahead of both of those guys because he's played more plays." 
</P>
<P>
Seau has been in the team's starting lineup since the second game of the 
season. And although he's been standing on the sideline in third-down 
situations, he's No. 2 in tackles with 73. 
</P>
<P>
"On third downs I'm sitting on the pines just looking at the guys go at it," he 
said. "It's frustrating. I never dropped back in coverage in college. It's 
coming together, but they're schooling me and I have to accept my role." 
</P>
<P>
His role, while presently that of a youngster in training, will change. As Lynn 
envisions it, Seau will play here, there and everywhere -- the way Denver has 
used Karl Mecklenberg in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"I think Junior can be the dominant guy in the league at his position," Lynn 
said. "I don't see any one else on the horizon. Name another inside linebacker. 
(Buffalo's) Shane Conlan? Shane Conlan can't carry this guy's helmet." 
</P>
<P>
That's all well and good, but Seau knows how well he played as an outside 
linebacker. His forte was rushing the passer, and here he is 15 games into his 
NFL career and he has yet to record a sack. 
</P>
<P>
It's no fun playing inside. No one notices. There is no glory. 
</P>
<P>
"Inside linebackers don't have as high a profile as outside linebackers," he 
said. "On the outside you get sacks. One sack a game, and you're considered a 
dominant player. 
</P>
<P>
"You get nine tackles a game as an inside linebacker, and you're just a good 
player. You don't get money nowadays for tackles. You don't get the prestige. 
You don't get the respect outside guys get." 
</P>
<P>
Before the draft, Seau met with the Chargers' coaching staff and said he 
welcomed the opportunity to play inside. After being selected, however, he 
began to balk at making the position change. After saying all the right things, 
everything went wrong. 
</P>
<P>
When contract negotiations stalled and then turned ugly, he became more 
irritated at the prospect of playing inside linebacker. By his own estimation, 
he had the most talent to offer at outside linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
"I was a lost kid at that time. Very confused," he said. "You can feel yourself 
falling off track and I fell off track. I lost my morals and values on what got 
me here. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I went out and played against the Raiders in the final preseason game and 
I wasn't ready. I got in the fight and everything happened so quickly. I 
couldn't grasp what happened. And what happened was Junior Seau was immature 
and ran away. He wanted to find a rock and just hide behind it." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers, however, stuck with Seau. They played him. They reminded him they 
were going to play him at inside linebacker, like it or not. And when he 
struggled, they continued to stay with him. 
</P>
<P>
"It's gonna take time. He would be involved in a lot more things on a lot more 
downs if he was in a position to handle it," Lynn said. "He isn't going to beat 
people by running by them like he did in college. He isn't going to be getting 
big stiffs at left tackle like he did in college. 
</P>
<P>
"He's become more patient and more disciplined. His first response to anything 
was to go at a 100-m.p.h. tempo. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like the first time you pick up a baseball bat. You're going to swing as 
hard as you can to hit the ball as far as you can. It takes some time to learn 
the timing is more important than brute strength. Junior can still be the great 
home run hitter, but being more efficient, he will be better." 
</P>
<P>
With his size -- 6-foot-3, 243 pounds -- Seau brings something special to the 
middle of the field. He's built like Chip Banks and runs like Anthony Miller. 
And when he's on target, he hits like Lee Williams and Leslie O'Neal -- 
combined. 
</P>
<P>
"You couldn't draw an athlete more perfectly," Lynn said. "He's a big man, and 
there are very few guys playing where he's playing that have the speed he has. 
</P>
<P>
"He made a play (against Denver) on a screen pass that got the attention of all 
his teammates. He was on the wrong side of the field, standing in the wrong 
place and yet he responds athletically and runs all the way across the field to 
stop a guy for a two-yard gain. You see something like that, and you realize 
he's not even scratching the surface." 
</P>
<P>
Williams recalled the same play. "Just unbelievable," he said. "I'm talking a 
great athlete here. It wouldn't be far-fetched to say what you have here is a 
potential superstar." 
</P>
<P>
Seau doesn't turn 22 until January, and he still hasn't experienced his first 
NFL training camp. He's as green as he is talented. 
</P>
<P>
"Junior's got the kind of raw physical ability, that regardless if you put him 
at free safety, he would make some great plays," linebacker Billy Ray Smith 
said. "I kind of gained a new appreciation for him, because he's got that 
natural ability, but he didn't rest on it." 
</P>
<P>
Smith, like Seau, was the fifth player selected in the first round of the 
draft. And like Seau, Smith was asked to make the switch from outside 
linebacker to the inside. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a different game inside," Smith said. "To be head up on the tight 
end or on the line of scrimmage looking in, you really only have to worry about 
guys coming at you from one side. 
</P>
<P>
"You move to the inside and it's kind of like the difference between 
tic-tac-toe and 3-D tic-tac-toe. It adds another dimension that you have to 
worry about." 
</P>
<P>
Smith stayed inside for three years -- a lifetime for an impatient Seau. 
</P>
<P>
"It's so different," Seau said. "When I was lining up at the beginning of the 
year, I was looking at half of the field. This was my half of the field. I 
wasn't looking at everybody who was participating in the game; just the people 
in my half. That's how I dealt with it. I had to simplify the defense." 
</P>
<P>
In the middle of the field, it's Times Square on New Year's Eve. If you make 
one wrong move, "you can't recover," Seau said. "On the outside, you can still 
make a mistake and your speed and athletic ability can bail you out of 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
Plummer, who perennially leads the team in tackles from his inside position, 
has provided a steady example for Seau. Plummer also has grown to respect his 
understudy. 
</P>
<P>
"I've really been amazed at his progress," Plummer said. "I've seen guys come 
and go and these guys played inside linebacker in college. 
</P>
<P>
"So what Junior has done without any previous experience amazes me even more. 
If he continues to improve like he has, there is no doubt in my mind he'll be 
an All-Pro some day." 
</P>
<P>
Seau, the embryonic superstar, still has the first sack to record, the first 
interception to grab, the first fumble to recover. And already, he's come so 
far. 
</P>
<P>
"No question in our mind," Lynn said, "we've got a gem here."

AZTECS NEARLY FALL APART, BUT BEAT BAYLOR; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 24-POINT LEAD CUT TO ONE BEFORE SAN DIEGO STATE WAKES UP. 
</P>

<P>
Baylor came into Thursday night's game against San Diego State with an 
impressive 6-1 record and a rather daunting statistic: Of its six victories, 
five came by an average margin of 32.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
Baylor, however, proved to be less than advertised. The Bears left the Sports 
Arena somewhat humbled, having been beaten by the Aztecs, 84-70. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth victory for the Aztecs in their past six games and gives them 
a 5-4 record as they head into Saturday night's game at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
They might bring some momentum into that one, or at least some added confidence 
if they consider they managed a 14-point victory Thursday night in front of 
2,025 despite going scoreless for six minutes and 22 seconds, a span that began 
with three minutes left in the opening half. 
</P>
<P>
"I think there are a couple of guys on this team who would like to sneak into 
the TV room early (today) and erase six minutes of game tape," Aztec coach Jim 
Brandenburg said. "We played six minutes of billiards ball there, but, hey, 
that's a 6-1 (now 6-2) basketball team, and they're pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
With just over three minutes remaining in the half, SDSU's Ray Barefield hit 
two free throws to give the Aztecs a 38-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
That's a 24-point safety zone of which, over the next six minutes, the Aztecs 
needed 23. 
</P>
<P>
Feeling comfortable with his team's lead, Brandenburg decided to give three 
starters -- guard Arthur Massey, center Marty Dow and forward Joe McNaull -- a 
rest after Barefield's free throws. 
</P>
<P>
An unfortunate ploy because the teammates those three left behind on the floor 
took a nap. 
</P>
<P>
"I broke our momentum at that point," Brandenburg said, "by putting in a bunch 
of guys who were cold. When you make changes like that, either of two things 
can happen. Either they'll hit the deck running and keep up the momentum, or 
they'll hit it cold and break the momentum." 
</P>
<P>
The latter occured and the Aztecs didn't score again in the half. 
</P>
<P>
So instead of going into the locker room with a comfortable buffer, the Aztecs 
went in with a precarious 10-point lead, 38-28. 
</P>
<P>
A big disappointment, considering the way Baylor was operating its man defense. 
Only the Servomation employees manning the hot dogs were less attentive. 
</P>
<P>
The Aztecs were able to go up by 24 points with three minutes left in in the 
half largely because Baylor let them. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego State had no trouble finding passing lanes to Dow underneath the 
basket. So they used them. Dow finished the half with 10 points, all from down 
low. 
</P>
<P>
"The middle was open a lot in the first half," Dow said. "And our perimeter 
guys did a great job passing the ball to me so I could just take it right to 
the hole." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman Chris McKinney, meanwhile, was opening up from the outside. He hit 
three jumpers of 15 feet or more and finished the half with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
Arthur Massey added five points, but was more effective passing the ball. He 
had six assists in the half. 
</P>
<P>
All that came in the first 17 minutes. The next three belonged to Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
More specifically, they belonged to David Wesley, who scored 10 of Baylor's 14 
points in that period and got an assist when he passed to center Alex Halcombe 
for a dunk that made it 38-23 with 66 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
No problem, Brandenburg thought. The Aztecs would just have to open the second 
half with a big run. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought we could come out and reestablish ourselves," Brandenburg said. "But 
they open by hitting a three and it's a seven-point lead instead of 10. 
</P>
<P>
It was Wesley who hit the three-pointer to close Baylor within seven. 
</P>
<P>
But the Bears did not stop there. In fact, they pulled within one, 40-39, four 
minutes into the half when Anthony Lewis got free underneath and put an easy 
one through the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
But that basket was also a wake-up call for the Aztecs, who went on to score 
the next nine points. 
</P>
<P>
"Everybody responded to our little lapse really well," Dow said. "They got 
within one and we came back and went on a big run." 
</P>
<P>
Massey started the streak by hitting two free throws. On the night, he made 12 
and improved his streak to 26 in a row. Only Joe Kramer has a longer free-throw 
streak in Aztec history. He hit 33 consecutively in 1977-78. 
</P>
<P>
Dow added 11 second-half points and finished with 21, most for the Aztecs. 
Massey finished with 19 points and nine assists and McKinney added 15 points. 
</P>
<P>
Wesley led all scorers with 22.

COLLEGES / ALAN DROOZ; 
</P>
<P>
THEY STILL LIONIZE LOYOLA DESPITE A SERIES OF KOS 
</P>

<P>
It is open season on the Loyola Marymount men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
December has seen Top 20 teams from sea to shining sea ring up Mike Tyson-style 
KOs over the outmanned Lions and laugh about it on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
UCLA conducted a dunk clinic and won by 51. In Norman, Okla., Billy Tubbs let 
his shooting guard, Brent Price, try to break the school scoring record. 
</P>
<P>
"I told him to break downcourt every time Loyola shot," Tubbs said. 
</P>
<P>
Price finished with 56 points and several Sooner starters were still on the 
floor at the end of a 60-point victory. 
</P>
<P>
Through it all, amazingly, Loyola remains a marquee name, a victim of its 
enormous success the past three seasons under then-Coach Paul Westhead. 
</P>
<P>
Featuring such standouts as Hank Gathers, Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer, the Lions 
lost a 148-141 overtime thriller to Louisiana State at Baton Rouge, La., last 
season on national TV. 
</P>
<P>
"I probably got more calls and letters about that game than any I can 
remember," LSU Coach Dale Brown said last week. "That was one of the most 
exciting games of all time." 
</P>
<P>
Because of that appeal, the now-outmanned Lions are still playing a 
star-studded, made-for-TV pre-conference schedule, and paying for it. 
</P>
<P>
And people are still coming out to see them on the road, expecting another 
great shootout. 
</P>
<P>
"They're not nearly the team they were," Brown said. "But because they score so 
many points they're dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
The blowouts aren't sitting well in Westchester, but Coach Jay Hillock and his 
team met last week to reaffirm their commitment to the running system. Last 
week they played their best game, playing LSU nearly even in Baton Rouge before 
losing by eight, then playing a competitive half against Georgia Tech in 
Atlanta before eventually losing by 41 points to fall to 2-7. 
</P>
<P>
"It seems like some people out there would like to bury us," said Loyola 
Athletic Director Brian Quinn, who felt Tubbs poured it on in Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm a little concerned about that. I mean, it isn't even the same coach here. 
I was a little emotional after the Oklahoma game but I was reacting as a fan at 
first. I'm sure people felt like that about us last year. I don't want to get 
into a cross-country spat with Oklahoma." 
</P>
<P>
Quinn said Lion fans need to be forgiving while the 1990-91 team finds the 
right combinations. 
</P>
<P>
"This is not the team we had last year," he said. "Everyone needs to be a 
little patient, the team needs to get its own identity. You just don't lose 
players like Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble and Jeff Fryer and Per Stumer. That was 
90 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
"That team last year would've won with any system. What the (Westhead) system 
does is put people in the seats. Remember, with the system (Westhead) went 4-10 
in conference the year he didn't have Bo and Hank (1986-87). 
</P>
<P>
"Jay's a very good coach and we've got some good players but they're kids, and 
we're really decimated (with injuries). If everyone can be patient, I think 
this is still going to be a very good team." 
</P>
<P>
En Garde: Due to injuries, Hillock is desperate for a backup for scoring leader 
Terrell Lowery at point guard. The situation is so forlorn that Hillock 
recently told a reporter, "We're so thin I'm No. 2 on the depth chart and 
you're No. 3." 
</P>
<P>
U.S. International University has made basketball headlines in recent years by 
giving up record numbers of points to running teams like Loyola Marymount and 
Oklahoma. But those setbacks are minor compared to the problem now facing the 
Gulls: bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
The San Diego-based school filed for economic reorganization last week and 
athletics may be among the casualties. The school's board of trustees will meet 
today and could decide to close down athletic programs immediately, putting the 
Jan. 5 game at Loyola in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
The players were on the road last week when they were informed of the 
bankruptcy moments before a tournament game in Dayton, Ohio. The Gulls (1-10) 
then were beaten by Murray State, 103-55. 
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of tears in the locker room (before the game) because they 
were afraid," USIU Coach Gary Zarecky said. "These are young men. They're 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky said he has not been paid in two months, and the only assurances the 
team got was that scholarships would be honored for the remainder of the school 
year. Zarecky said he was as shaken as his players when Dayton reporters called 
the Gulls "a team without a school." 
</P>
<P>
Zarecky's team allowed an NCAA-record 181 points by Loyola two seasons ago, and 
last December Oklahoma scored a best-ever 97 points in a half. But Zarecky said 
he used those games as motivation. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been motivated for six years . . . by all the adversity and negativisms 
and sneering," he said. "I've been motivated to prove people wrong." 
</P>
<P>
"Now things are happening that are out of my control. Everybody's fighting for 
their lives right now." 
</P>
<P>
Stat of the Week: Despite the four-game losing streak the Lions took into the 
week, Loyola has seven players scoring in double figures, led by Terrell 
Lowery's 29.4 average. The statistic is misleading, however, because the Lions 
have never been able to put all seven players in the lineup in the same game. 
Freshman Kareem Washington, averaging 13.3 points, has missed the past three 
games with a groin pull and will probably be held out until mid-January, and 
sophomore Brian McCloskey, scoring 12.3 per game, missed the last two games 
when tests revealed a stress fracture in his lower back. 
</P>
<P>
Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team (7-4) takes a five-game 
winning streak into Azusa Pacific (7-5) at 7:30 p.m. Saturday. Brian Jones 
leads four Toros averaging double figures with a 14.3 average. Dave Yanai's 
team is holding opponents to 63.7 points a game and only 58.2 during the win 
streak. . . . The Dominguez Hills women, off to their second-best start at 
10-2, travel north to play Cal State Hayward on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Two former El Camino College football players are appearing in bowl games this 
week. Defensive end Jeff Cummins (Torrance High) will start for Oregon in 
Saturday's Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium, and wide receiver Sean Smith 
(Leuzinger High) will be in Iowa's starting lineup in Tuesday's Rose Bowl. . . 
. According to the newsletter of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los 
Angeles, a basketball player now has a better chance of playing with a team 
overseas than making an NBA roster. The NBA has 324 players and there are more 
than 500 Americans playing in 22 foreign countries, with the most in France 
(110), Italy (73) and Spain (68). The list includes Dominguez Hills graduate 
Anthony Blackmon, who is playing in Japan.

MULLIGAN IS KEY ADDITION TO PALOS VERDES' LINEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The new player who will probably help the Palos Verdes High girls' basketball 
team the most this season is Kristen Mulligan. She transferred from Rancho 
Santa Margarita after a sophomore season in which she averaged 23 points a 
game, was named Olympic League most valuable player and was a first-team 
All-CIF selection. 
</P>
<P>
Mulligan, a point guard, will fill the scoring role vacated by Lisa Humphreys, 
who graduated. 
</P>
<P>
The Sea Kings have another set of twin towers this season in Monique Morehouse, 
a 6-foot-3 junior, and transfer Jeffra Gausepohl. Two seasons ago, it was the 
6-5 Burge twins -- Heather and Heidi -- who gave Coach Wendell Yoshida a unique 
inside combination. 
</P>
<P>
Gausepohl, a 6-5 junior who moved from Kennett Square, Pa., a small town 20 
miles outside of Philadelphia, was an all-district performer last season and 
will give the Sea Kings added scoring (14.5 points) and rebounding (10 
rebounds). 
</P>
<P>
Mimi McKinney, a 5-9 freshman, is the type of player coaches wish they had time 
to develop. Fortunately, Yoshida does have time to work with McKinney, who was 
a member of a second-place Amateur Athletic Union 13-and-under team and was 
named an All-American. 
</P>
<P>
McKinney moved into the Palos Verdes district from San Pedro, where she would 
have still been in the junior high system because of the three-year high school 
system in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
Yoshida got a strong, experienced inside player when Nicole Dietel, a 6-1 
senior, transferred from Westminster High, where she had played on the varsity 
team for three seasons.

LEUZINGER, NARBONNE ADVANCE TO TORRANCE FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leuzinger High basketball Coach Phil Sherman said that despite the Olympians' 
6-2 record, they haven't been executing particularly well. And in the first 
half of their Torrance tournament game Thursday night at West Torrance High 
against Rancho Alamitos, Leuzinger's play fit the coach's pregame description. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what our problem has been for the last three games." Sherman 
said. "We haven't been playing very well at the beginning of our ballgames. . . 
. The difference tonight was that (Rancho Alamitos) could not handle the 
pressure that we applied in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger finally defeated Rancho Alamitos, 85-60, to advance to tonight's 
championship game. The Olympians will play Narbonne at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger seized control of the game in the final quarter with an 11-2 run that 
increased its lead to 69-49. 
</P>
<P>
Back-to-back slam dunks by Frank Willis and Tyrone Merriweather seemed to get 
the Olympians out of their early funk, but pesky Rancho Alamitos (2-4) kept it 
close and trailed, 40-32, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Tough defense coupled with the hot perimeter shooting of Antwan Lewis enabled 
Leuzinger to begin to pull away in the third quarter. Lewis scored eight of his 
game-high 16 points in the period and the Olympians stretched their lead to 
59-47. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Northern added 14 points and Merriweather 12 for Leuzinger. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne 61, West 59 -- Two free throws by Vijay Mani with 28 seconds remaining 
helped the Gauchos preserve their come-from-behind victory. 
</P>
<P>
"They (West) were able to get off to a fast start in the first half because 
they dominated the boards." Narbonne Coach Bob Hoppes said. "We made some 
adjustments at halftime and played a man-to-man defense in the second half. 
That allowed us to get back into the game." 
</P>
<P>
It was an uphill battle for the Gauchos (5-6). After falling behind by 12 
points in the first half, they chipped away at Warriors' lead and trailed, 
32-27, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the final quarter, Narbonne trailed, 41-40. 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos' Wil Weir led all scorers with the 21 points. Dmitri Rideout had 18 
and Charles Watkins added 10. 
</P>
<P>
West's Todd Blischke had 19 points, Jim Faulkner scored 13 and David Foster 
added 12. 
</P>
<P>
West (3-7) will play Rancho Alamitos in tonight's consolation game at 6 p.m.

HOLIDAY BOWL NOTEBOOK; 
</P>
<P>
LUNCHEON HAS ADDED MEANING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
History joined the football teams from Brigham Young and Texas A&amp;M aboard 
the aircraft carrier USS Independence at a luncheon/tour Thursday, and it 
wasn't just Holiday Bowl lore. 
</P>
<P>
The carrier returned from the Persian Gulf about a week ago, and team officials 
and players were a bit awed. 
</P>
<P>
"As we rounded the corner and came into the parking lot, I looked up at the 
Independence and realized this is the ninth time we've had the opportunity at 
Brigham Young to be here in this great city and at this great bowl game," BYU 
Coach LaVell Edwards said. "And all of a sudden, the realization struck me that 
it's a little different perspective this year than what it's been in other 
years. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great experience, and a great opportunity for all of us to be here. 
These young men serving on this ship give us pause to stop and think about some 
of the events happening around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Said Texas A&amp;M Coach R.C. Slocum: "We're delighted to be here. We think it 
is particularly fitting that Texas A&amp;M, a school steeped in military 
history, is out here on this boat." 
</P>
<P>
Edwards and Slocum each presented a team jersey to honorary captains for 
Saturday's game. Edwards gave Chief Petty Officer Bill Holt, from Spanish Fort, 
Utah, a blue BYU jersey. The word "Independence" was lettered across the back 
above No. 62 -- the ship's number. Slocum, meanwhile, presented an Aggie jersey 
to Lance Cpl. Byron Hall of Tyler, Tex. Hall's jersey was No. 12, for the 
traditional Texas A&amp;M 12th man. 
</P>
<P>
Injury report: BYU senior halfback Matt Bellini wasn't going to start 
Saturday's game, then he was. Now, he's questionable. 
</P>
<P>
"Whether he does or doesn't (start) really doesn't matter," Edwards said. "He's 
going to be suited up and playing -- it just depends on how much he can 
handle." 
</P>
<P>
Bellini tore ligaments in his right ankle Nov. 17 against Utah. Senior Stacey 
Corley, who started two games and gained 288 yards on 70 carries, will start if 
Bellini can't. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BYU secondary has been hit hard. Junior cornerback Tony 
Crutchfield (knee) and senior strong safety Norm Dixon (back spasms) are both 
doubtful for Texas A&amp;M. Crutchfield has been nursing his injury all season 
and didn't play much in BYU's final two games. He will be replaced by junior 
Ervin Lee. Dixon's back, meanwhile, acted up in practice Wednesday. He will be 
replaced by junior Josh Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
For Texas A&amp;M, fullback Robert Wilson was sick Thursday with a virus. 
</P>
<P>
What injury? BYU quarterback Ty Detmer was surprised Thursday at a reference in 
a newspaper to his shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
No big deal, Detmer said. He has a ligament strain in his right shoulder, 
suffered Nov. 17 against Utah. He played with pain the next week against Utah 
State and Dec. 1 at Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"It's not a big deal," he said. "I guess (the newspaper) is looking for some 
excitement. I don't know why it came up." 
</P>
<P>
Is the shoulder sore? 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't hurt to throw."

George Curtis, BYU head trainer, said Detmer has not had any kind of therapy 
for shoulder, nor is there a need for any. 
</P>
<P>
Add Detmer: The game isn't the only thing that will be on Detmer's mind 
Saturday. His grandfather, Hubert Sr., has cancer and the family doesn't expect 
him to be around for next football season. 
</P>
<P>
"He's hanging in there, barely," Detmer said. "This will probably be his last 
football game involving me. . . . Some days he will have bad days, and other 
times he'll be a little bit better." 
</P>
<P>
Detmer said he spoke with his grandfather, who lives in San Antonio, on 
Christmas Day and plans to again after Saturday's game. 
</P>
<P>
Primal scream: There are several traditions at Texas A&amp;M. One is called 
"Midnight Yell Practice." It is held at Kyle Field in College Station, Tex., on 
the Friday night before home games. The Aggie band starts a parade on campus 
and marches to the field, led by A&amp;M Yell Leaders carrying torches. 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, the tradition storms into San Diego County. Texas A&amp;M fans are 
planning to hold Midnight Yell Practice at the La Jolla Hyatt. At midnight, of 
course. 
</P>
<P>
Holiday Bowl Notes: 
</P>
<P>
Texas A&amp;M kicker Layne Talbot got married Saturday, three days before 
Christmas. His wife was due to arrive in San Diego Thursday. Her name is Noel. 
We are not making this up. . . . At Thursday's luncheon, Texas A&amp;M fullback 
Robert Wilson and BYU quarterback Ty Detmer each received the Admiral's Trophy. 
The award goes to a player on each team who exemplifies unselfishness and 
teamwork and is selected by a secret ballot from members his team. . . . Square 
Pan Pizza hosted the luncheon, so you know what was served. In case you're 
wondering, a pizza official said 5,760 slices were prepared -- 240 trays of 24 
slices each. . . . BYU Coach LaVell Edwards has been able to spend some time 
with his family this week. "First time we've all been together in three years," 
he said. In town are son John, 32, and his wife and three children from New 
York; son Jim, 28, with his wife and two children from Nevada; and daughter 
Ann, with her husband and four children from Utah. They all arrived Wednesday 
afternoon. Edwards' plan was to get Mexican food that night, but he ran into an 
hour wait in Old Town so he opted for Italian. . . . The funniest thing to 
happen to BYU since the Cougars' Christmas Day arrival? "Probably going to the 
otter show, when the walrus spit water," BYU defensive back Brian Mitchell 
said. "I think he (spat on) all Texas A&amp;M fans."

</P>
<P>
BOXING: STEPHANIE LAMOTTA IS IN A LOT TOUGHER FIGHT THAN HER FATHER EVER WAS. 
THE OPPONENT IS MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
The punching bag in the drafty gym rattled loudly at first but then Stephanie 
LaMotta increased the tempo of her punches and the bag produced a steady, 
throbbing hum. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 minutes she pounded the bag, alternating between her left and right 
fists. Sweat began to stream down her face. 
</P>
<P>
In a sense, LaMotta, a Los Angeles actress, wasn't punching the speed bag. 
Instead, her punches lashed out at a silent, unseen enemy more terrifying, more 
dangerous than any human opponent. 
</P>
<P>
The opponent: Multiple sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
It was possibly the best mugger story of the 1980s. Stephanie LaMotta, daughter 
of former world middleweight champion Jake LaMotta, not only warded off a 
knife-wielding mugger, she knocked him out. 
</P>
<P>
"Dat's my goil!" cooed her happy father. "Idn't dat cute?" 
</P>
<P>
It happened late one night in 1982, on a London street. LaMotta, alone, walked 
out of a nightclub toward her car when a man approached and asked for money. 
</P>
<P>
"The funny part is, I was going to give him some money," she recalled recently, 
after a boxing workout. 
</P>
<P>
"I said: 'Come over to my car and I'll write you a small check.' Then he wanted 
my jewelry, and he pulled out a knife. 
</P>
<P>
"Then I said: 'Do you know who I am? I'm going to hurt you if you use that.' 
</P>
<P>
"He tried to stab me, but I blocked the knife with my left hand. When I saw 
blood from the cut, I went into a rage. 
</P>
<P>
"I hit him in the stomach with my left hand and as he started to double up, I 
hit him on the jaw with my right. He went down on his back, out cold. At first, 
I thought I'd killed him. 
</P>
<P>
"When the police came, I was holding his head off the sidewalk, wondering if he 
was alive." 
</P>
<P>
The mugger was alive . . . and lucky. He got only seven years, for attempted 
murder. His intended victim, Stephanie LaMotta was serving a life term with MS. 
</P>
<P>
The first symptom appeared in 1979. She was in a London recording studio, 
cutting a record with her band, called "Stephanie LaMotta's Band." 
</P>
<P>
"I was the guitarist, and I was playing the lead riff, a piece I'd played 
hundreds of times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"All of a sudden, I couldn't press the strings with my left fingers. All I 
could do with my left hand was slide it down the guitar. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think much about it at the time. I attributed it to stress and 
fatigue. Then I started dropping things and falling down. 
</P>
<P>
"Shortly after that, I was on vacation in Vienna when I started losing sight in 
my right eye. 
</P>
<P>
"It was like a shade descending slowly over my sight. Then the left eye started 
going. By the time I got to New York to start seeing doctors, I was blind. 
</P>
<P>
"The first two doctors I saw were ophthalmologists, and they had no idea what 
was wrong. Then I started seeing neurologists. The third one I saw, Dr. John 
Schaefer, was the one who diagnosed me for MS. At this point, I was wearing a 
Braille watch. I was really depressed." 
</P>
<P>
LaMotta regained her sight. Sort of. Some days she has 20-20 vision. On others, 
she says, she can't see her hand in front of her face. Some days she has 
slurred speech. She once played both guitar and piano, but hasn't played either 
since that day in 1979 when the weakness in her left hand appeared, and stayed. 
For nine months in 1980, her entire left side was paralyzed. The paralysis 
left, but she still has no feeling on her left side. But to see her today doing 
her vigorous boxing workout, you'd never know this was a woman with a gun to 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
The special terror of MS is its uncertainty -- the daily, chilling fear 
sufferers carry for a lifetime. The disease wages a psychological warfare upon 
those afflicted that is nearly as debilitating as its attack upon the central 
nervous system. 
</P>
<P>
In MS, a disease that afflicts about 250,000 Americans, the protective coating 
around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord inexplicably begins to 
deteriorate. Scar tissue forms. The effect is similar to what happens when an 
electrical wire short-circuits. 
</P>
<P>
Symptoms ranging from minor to major paralysis, to vision impairment -- which 
can be complete blindness -- can become permanent. Or the symptoms can come and 
go during a lifetime. Or they can come once, disappear, and never appear again. 
</P>
<P>
That is Stephanie LaMotta's torment -- not knowing if tomorrow is the day she 
becomes a prisoner in her own body . . . or if she will be free of MS symptoms 
for the rest of her life. LaMotta, 31, the national spokeswoman for the 
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, looks you straight in the eye when she 
tells you she's fighting MS just as her father fought the likes of Sugar Ray 
Robinson and Marcel Cerdan, decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
Her father, known as "The Bronx Bull" because of his free-swinging style, was 
the middleweight champion in 1949 and '50. He was the fighter portrayed in the 
1980 film, "Raging Bull." 
</P>
<P>
So when the story came out that Jake's little girl -- actually, at 5-feet-8, 
she's as tall as her father -- had flattened the mugger in London, no one who 
knew her was surprised. To kids who grew up in her Sutton Place neighborhood in 
New York, the byword was: "Don't mess with Stephanie." 
</P>
<P>
"I hung out in gyms with my dad all the time when I was little," she said. "My 
dad was through boxing then, but he worked out, and he taught me how to fight. 
</P>
<P>
"One time when I was 12, a girl beat me up at school. I mean really beat me up. 
So when my dad saw my face, we went to the gym and he taught me some stuff. So 
I beat her up pretty good, the next time I saw her. 
</P>
<P>
"We both got kicked out of school for fighting, but the best part of that was I 
got to go to the gym every day with my dad." 
</P>
<P>
Jake LaMotta's marital history is a bit complex. He has been married six times 
and has seven children. Stephanie is the middle child, and her mother is 
Dimitria LaMotta, Jake's fourth wife. 
</P>
<P>
"My mother is Greek and beautiful," Stephanie said. 
</P>
<P>
She hopes to make the LaMotta name prominent again in boxing. She teaches the 
LaMotta boxing workout to people who want to become fit by training as a boxer, 
but who don't want to box. 
</P>
<P>
She has 42 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
"When I start with someone, I tell them what equipment to buy -- the gloves, 
bags, jump ropes and all that," she said. "Then I go to their home on a regular 
schedule and teach and supervise the workout. I teach a real mix of people -- 
actors, secretaries, construction workers, waiters, Century City executives . . 
. even one chairman of a board. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometime down the road, I'd like to open a gym." 
</P>
<P>
She has produced a boxing video, "Stephanie LaMotta's Boxersize Workout," due 
out in March. 
</P>
<P>
Her boxing trainer is Tony Rivera of Montebello, who is also former champion 
Roberto Duran's assistant trainer. He supervises all her workouts. 
</P>
<P>
This day, he helped her pull on and lace up her boxing gloves. 
</P>
<P>
"These were once worn by Hilario Zapata, isn't that great?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
Zapata was world flyweight champion in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
During a recent LaMotta workout at the Los Angeles Youth Athletic Center gym -- 
it's on the fifth floor of what once was the Lincoln Heights Jail -- Rivera 
talked about LaMotta's athleticism as she tattooed the speed bag. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at the rhythm she has," he said. "She's a very good athlete. Even though 
she doesn't hit anyone, she looks better doing her workout than half the pros 
you see in here." 
</P>
<P>
Rivera has taught her a wrinkle from Duran's workouts, "the money walk." 
</P>
<P>
Striding about with long steps, LaMotta bent down at every other step and 
touched the floor with first the left hand, then the right. 
</P>
<P>
"Roberto Duran does this all the time -- it's a stretching exercise," she said. 
"He told me to pretend like I'm walking around picking up money. You stretch 
the back of your legs, your arms, lower back and shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
Although she is proud of her father's boxing career and occasionally 
accompanies him to major Las Vegas fights, she is not a fan. 
</P>
<P>
"Actually, I really don't like boxing," she said. "I really don't enjoy seeing 
men hit each other. But Dad gets ringside seats, so I like to go with him and 
meet important people. 
</P>
<P>
"Did I say that? That sounds terrible." 
</P>
<P>
She is not totally free of MS symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"My legs are weak, I can't run at all," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"A year ago, I entered a 12-mile charity walkathon and practically finished on 
all fours. I was in bed a week after that." 
</P>
<P>
There is no evidence that boxing workouts, or any other kind of physical 
activity, wards off or lessens the degree of MS symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
"All I can tell you is that I feel good after these workouts, that my doctor 
tells me if it feels good, keep doing it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Fact is, doctors know very little about MS. It's known that women are afflicted 
slightly more often than men, and that environmental factors are somehow 
related. The disease strikes people in temperate climates more often than in 
other regions. 
</P>
<P>
MS has been linked by some researchers to where a patient's first 15 years of 
life were spent. 
</P>
<P>
The disease is extremely difficult to diagnose, a process that can take up to 
five years. Most often, diagnosis comes only after a long list of other 
possibilities -- ranging from syphilis to cerebral infarctions to spinal 
arthritis -- are eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
There is no cure. Moreover, spontaneous remissions and the sudden onset of 
symptoms make any treatment difficult to evaluate. Research continues. More 
than $10 million was spent on MS research in 1990, according to the National MS 
Society. 
</P>
<P>
Researchers are hopeful that AIDS research may provide clues to the causes of 
MS. 
</P>
<P>
"It's believed there may be some parallels in the immunology of AIDS and MS," 
said Thomas Fauble, an Arcadia neurologist who keeps close tabs on MS research. 
</P>
<P>
"Very generally, the same thing happens in both diseases -- the immune system 
is disrupted and ceases to act in a normal protective fashion. Everyone hopes 
AIDS research will spill over, and help people with MS." 
</P>
<P>
LaMotta toweled off after her workout and talked about her outlook for her 
life. On May 25, she will marry Jacques Dreyfus, a Los Angeles musician. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm in remission," she said. "But some people go into remission for 10 
minutes, others for 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm totally annoyed by MS," she said. "That's about it -- I'm annoyed. Am I 
bitter? No. You're dealt cards in your life, OK? This is my card. I can deal 
with it."

THIS SECOND-ROUND DRAFT SELECTION IS REALLY A FIRST-RATE PLAYER; 
</P>
<P>
RAIDERS: PASS-RUSH SPECIALIST AARON WALLACE WAS IRATE WHEN HE WASN'T DRAFTED 
HIGHER, BUT NOW HE IS GLAD TO BE IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Raider rookie Aaron Wallace recorded his ninth sack of the season last 
Saturday in Minnesota, his mind raced back to April, when he stormed out of his 
house in Dallas after being bypassed in the NFL draft's first round. He headed 
for the border, car stereo blasting, in indignation. What border? What 
difference? 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders, who took Wallace in the second round with the 37th pick, had to 
flag him down via car phone. The other choice was Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
Foolish child. Wallace was so much younger then. To think he made such a stink 
about a few pegs -- OK, a lot of dollars -- on a draft ladder. But what's 
first-round draft money, really, if you have to spend it as a New England 
Patriot? 
</P>
<P>
Seven months after Wallace carved out a new Chisholm Trail on the Texas 
landscape with his tire tracks, he has come to realize that there is life after 
draft day. 
</P>
<P>
Listen to Wallace in late December: 
</P>
<P>
"I can't think of anyone else I'd like to play for at this point," he said. "I 
would have done my best anywhere I went. When I found out I was in the second 
round, I was upset, but when I found out I was coming to the Raiders, 
everything didn't seem so bad. It's just the mystique. It's hard to explain. I 
guess it's Mr. Davis, Art Shell, the organization. I'm just really happy to be 
here." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace was flattered when owner Al Davis took an immediate interest in him 
during his first days at camp, when Wallace was still brooding over his draft 
selection -- "I'd read and heard that I was going to be as high as a top-10 
pick." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said "Mr. Davis" made him feel as though he belonged. "He told me he 
thought I was going to be a great player," Wallace said. "I had just got here 
and wasn't too confident how good I could really be in the pros. One thing he 
always tells me: 'Make me proud of you.' I try to come out here and do it." 
</P>
<P>
Davis is unique, of course, in that he attends every Raider practice and isn't 
afraid to offer on-the-field advice. Players who don't call him "Mister" 
sometimes refer to him as "Coach." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace said he knew it was serious business when he walked into camp. 
"Football is their game, from what I can tell," he said. "I mean, the man 
(Davis) doesn't have to be out here. A lot of owners probably aren't. But he's 
out there every day offering his advice, telling you what to watch for." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace didn't know what he was in for. The Raiders are on the brink of winning 
their first division title in five seasons, and Wallace is in the thick of it. 
His nine sacks are remarkable in that he's only a part-time player, a so-called 
pass-rush specialist. Wallace calls himself "a-third-and-long guy." 
</P>
<P>
He's rubbing elbows and learning the trade from such defensive line luminaries 
as Howie Long, Greg Townsend and Bob Golic, who marvel at Wallace's speed and 
quickness at 6-feet-3 and 235 pounds. Long said Wallace can chase down anything 
with a heartbeat. They believe he's only scratching the surface. 
</P>
<P>
"I get in there and I want to do the things they do, like the rip techniques," 
Wallace said. "But they say my biggest asset is speed. I guess they see 
something that I have, something that could be great, I guess, the way they 
act." 
</P>
<P>
With one game remaining, Wallace has a chance to join some elite company among 
pass rushers. The NFL record for sacks by a rookie is 12 1/2, set by San 
Diego's Leslie O'Neal in 1986. The San Francisco 49ers' Charles Haley had 12 
sacks as a rookie in the same season. 
</P>
<P>
"I had no idea what the record was," Wallace said. "I had no idea I was that 
close." 
</P>
<P>
Wallace had three sacks in an exhibition game against the Chicago Bears last 
summer, so the record is not out of reach in Sunday's regular-season finale 
against the Chargers at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Coach Art Shell said Wallace reminds him of a young Townsend, who burst 
upon the scene in 1983 with 10 1/2 sacks as a rookie. Townsend was considered a 
pass-rush specialist at first, too, but eventually developed into a menacing 
full-time player. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace presently serves as Townsend's backup. And heir apparent? 
</P>
<P>
"Eventually, yeah," Shell said. "He's going to be a big man. He's still young. 
By the time he's finished, he'll probably be a 250-pounder. When Greg Townsend 
got here, he was a 230-pounder." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend acknowledges some similarities between himself and Wallace but 
disavows others. 
</P>
<P>
"Aaron is much faster than I was," Townsend said. "Plus, he was picked higher, 
too (Townsend was a fourth-round choice). Aaron has raw talent, as I did as a 
rookie. I played on pure hustle, and some of the things I was just born with. 
By the same token, Aaron is unique. If you see him out there on the field, when 
he gets his sacks, he very seldom makes contact with the (blocker). I was all 
physical. Aaron is more finesse. I think he has a magnet, because when the 
quarterback gets close, he just jumps on the guy." 
</P>
<P>
Townsend and Wallace also share a disdain for being labeled one-dimensional 
players. 
</P>
<P>
"I had this crazy attitude about being a pass-rush specialist," Townsend said. 
"I hate that title." 
</P>
<P>
But Wallace was drafted strictly as a pass rusher, for now. In his Texas 
A&amp;M career, he recorded a school-record 42 sacks. His nickname has been 
"Sackman" since high school. 
</P>
<P>
"Go back and check his college record," Shell said. "The guy was a pass rusher. 
He was a sack guy. With the kind of speed he has, and the kind of quickness he 
has, there's no doubt in our minds the guy will be a good pass rusher in this 
league."

FUTURE UNDECIDED, ROBINSON SAYS

<TEXT>
<P>
Although Ram Coach John Robinson insisted that he didn't want to add more drama 
to his job situation, he kept things intriguing by suggesting that he isn't at 
all sure what will happen in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson is expected to meet with Executive Vice President John Shaw next week, 
and until then neither side will predict whether Robinson's eight-year tenure 
with the team will end. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't have any idea," Robinson said, adding that he wouldn't have any 
further comment "until it's decided one way or the other. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"The (job situation) thing took on a life of its own. I think there were a lot 
of things that were written that were not true . . . 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, it's going to be on everybody's mind and we will all make a 
statement one way or the other at some point. Until then . . . I mean, I'm not 
going to contribute to . . . something that's gone as far afield as it has." 
</P>
<P>
Couldn't Robinson say something now that could stop the speculation? 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I can," Robinson said. "If you could give me some clue to what I 
could say to slow down the snowball, I would be happy to say it." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, reached earlier this week, said that nothing had changed to warrant a 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything's the same as it's been," Shaw said, disregarding talk that 
Robinson himself might decide to leave even if the front office wants to keep 
him. "It's an ownership decision, and nothing has changed that." TIM KAWAKAMI

Dallas Cowboy quarterback Troy Aikman says don't write him off yet -- his 
separated right shoulder feels much better -- and he wants a second opinion 
about surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Jimmy Johnson, however, still expects to place Aikman on injured reserve 
today. Aikman, who was hurt in Sunday's loss at Philadelphia, put off a 
decision Wednesday regarding surgery because he said the pain and swelling in 
the shoulder had subsided and its mobility had increased.

Former heavyweight champion Mike Tyson filed suit in New York to stop the next 
heavyweight championship bout, saying that he, not George Foreman, should have 
the first opportunity to challenge champion Evander Holyfield. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit seeks $10 million in damages from the World Boxing Assn., the 
International Federation of Boxing and officers of the two organizations. Tyson 
claims that the WBA and IBF violated their own rules when they denied him a 
rematch with Buster Douglas.

PADRES' SANTIAGO JAILED; PLAYER SAYS HE WAS BEATEN BY OFFICERS

San Diego Padre catcher Benito Santiago was arrested Sunday night on suspicion 
of driving under the influence of alcohol and resisting arrest after an 
incident during which the Padre All-Star said he was beaten by three officers. 
</P>
<P>
Coronado Police Dept. spokesman Detective Keith James said Santiago spent about 
four hours in jail. 
</P>
<P>
Ed Checkert, deputy district attorney in the South Bay office, said charges 
have not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
Santiago said Thursday night that he was innocent and that he suffered a black 
eye, a scratch on the side of his face, a sore neck and a sore left forearm. 
</P>
<P>
Ishmael Fonseca, an arresting officer, was unavailable for comment. Sgt. James 
Adams, a shift supervisor who said he was familiar with the case, said Santiago 
was not mistreated. 
</P>
<P>
"What our guys did was right," Adams said. "Benito pushed it." 
</P>
<P>
Scott Boras, Santiago's agent and lawyer, said he is uncomfortable with the way 
the matter was handled. 
</P>
<P>
"The entire case will be reviewed succinctly by myself and our legal 
department," Boras said, "and (police) conduct will be scrutinized in 
accordance with provisional rules and regulations governing the conduct of 
police officers in that situation. If after review we find their conduct not 
within those standards, we will definitely pursue litigation." 
</P>
<P>
Said Adams: "Let's go to court. When the situation comes out in court, I think 
you'll find what Benito said is not accurate, and we'll prove it." 
</P>
<P>
Padre President Dick Freeman said he knew nothing about the matter. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not aware of it," Freeman said. "I've got no comment."

Six USC seniors will play in postseason all-star games: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Linebacker Scott Ross, offensive tackle Pat Harlow and offensive guard Mark 
Tucker will play in the Hula Bowl Jan. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 -- On the same day, flanker Gary Wellman will play in the Senior Bowl at 
Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Harlow, tailback Ricky Ervins and defensive guard Don Gibson will play in 
the Japan Bowl Jan. 13 at Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Gibson and Ross will play in the East-West Shrine game Jan. 26 at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Larry Smith said USC has received unwritten commitments from 12 recruits, 
about twice the number that would usually have committed by this time. Letters 
of intent can't be signed until Feb. 6. "We've really gotten off to a great 
start," said Smith, who hopes to sign 24 players. "We had about 30 guys visit 
and we've gotten 12 commitments. We've got another 35 visiting after the first 
of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Among those who have committed is Smith's son, Corby, a quarterback who led 
Loyola High to the Southern Section Division I championship. JERRY CROWE

LONGHORNS' THOMAS CAN'T STAY SILENT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Before Texas' game against Texas A&amp;M this season, Longhorn offensive tackle 
Stan Thomas boasted to a group of reporters that the Texas starters would be 
out of the game by the third quarter, "eating hot dogs and telling Aggie 
jokes." 
</P>
<P>
Although Texas did indeed win the game, 28-27, Thomas, a senior from El Centro, 
Calif., got some friendly advice from Texas Coach David McWilliams: Keep your 
enthusiasm in check -- or at least out of the newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
It doesn't appear that Thomas took the message to heart, however. 
</P>
<P>
Thursday, surrounded by reporters at the Cotton Bowl, he predicted that Texas 
would beat Miami in the New Year's Day game, 28-10, and described the 
Hurricanes in a variety of unflattering terms, "gangster-looking" being one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Apparently what set Thomas off was a joint appearance by the teams at a 
barbecue given by the Cotton Bowl at a Dallas club Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought I was in the Huntsville (Tex.) penitentiary," Thomas said. "I can't 
wait to play them. They walked around like they owned the whole place. That's 
their attitude. They're arrogant." 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Miami players reacted to Thomas' comments with shrugs. "We were a 
little more relaxed (at the barbecue). The Texas guys stayed pretty much to 
themselves," safety Charles Pharms said. "Maybe they do feel like we're cocky. 
I just thought we were trying to relax." DANNY ROBBINS

GAMEL QUITS BOARD, VOTES PROXIES FOR HUBBARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Gamel, one of Hollywood Park's major shareholders, said Thursday that he 
has resigned from the board of directors of the Hollywood Park Operating Co. 
and is voting his proxies for R.D. Hubbard in Hubbard's battle to unseat Marje 
Everett as chief executive officer of the track. 
</P>
<P>
Gamel, who owns 5.6% of the stock, said he will continue to serve on the board 
of Hollywood Park Realty, which controls the track's property and leases it to 
Hollywood Park Operating. 
</P>
<P>
Gamel's proxy declaration was not surprising, since he and Hubbard once 
belonged to a group that tried to buy Hollywood Park. Last summer, Gamel 
unsuccessfully tried to get Hubbard appointed to the operating company's board. 
Hubbard, Hollywood's largest stockholder, owns 9.9%, the most allowed one party 
under the track's Real Estate Investment Trust arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the firm tallying consent cards Hubbard has sent to 
shareholders indicate that he has more than the 50% plus one vote needed to 
replace the Everett-led operating company board with his slate of directors. 
Any result is tentative, however, because the shareholders also have until 
midnight Monday to cancel their original votes. 
</P>
<P>
"I voted my proxies simply because I feel that Hubbard is better suited to run 
the track than Everett," said Gamel, a horse owner who lives in Denver. "It was 
clear that I had no place on the operating company's board. I've been excluded 
from a lot of the things they've been doing lately. In effect, they've fired me 
from the board, which I think is totally wrong. I also wanted off the board 
because I don't want to be subjected to any legal actions that might be taken 
against the company." BILL CHRISTINE

AIR AROUND BURWELL CLEARED UP IN OREGON; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FRESHMAN'S TEAM-HIGH 1,539 TOTAL YARDS HELP WASH AWAY THE 
FRUSTRATION OF HIGH SCHOOL TRANSFER PROBLEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF MEYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
University of Oregon tailback Sean Burwell chuckled recently when he was asked 
about the bleakest moment of his football career -- the City Section's 1987 
decision to bar him from playing at Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
"It was really stupid," Burwell said, "but I can laugh at it now." 
</P>
<P>
Burwell treats the incident lightly because his career turned out all right. In 
fact, it turned out better than all right. Burwell, a redshirt freshman, was 
Oregon's leading rusher this season and he set a school record for all-purpose 
yards with 1,539. On Saturday, the 5-foot-11, 181-pound tailback will lead the 
Ducks against Colorado State in the Freedom Bowl at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
But as a high school junior back in '87, Burwell's future wasn't so certain. He 
had transferred to Cleveland from Chaminade -- a small, private parochial 
school -- rather than face punishment for his role in a fight with a teammate 
during a summer weight-training session. But City Section red tape and rules 
turned Burwell into a gridiron exile at his own school. 
</P>
<P>
He could attend Cleveland, a public school only a few blocks from his Canoga 
Park home but was not allowed to play football for the Cavaliers. A newspaper 
article at the time called him "football's version of the man in the iron face 
mask." 
</P>
<P>
Burwell had been projected as a starter for Cleveland. As a sophomore at 
Chaminade, he had gained more yards (1,211) that year than any area high school 
athlete, with the exception of Russell White. 
</P>
<P>
He practiced with Cleveland in the fall of '87, but a few days before the 
opener, the City declared him ineligible because, basically, his mother made 
too much money. 
</P>
<P>
The City grants eligibility to a player who changes schools but not his 
residence if the player proves that it would be a financial or emotional 
hardship to go anywhere else. Burwell first claimed financial hardship, but a 
City rules committee voted 6 to 0 to deny him eligibility on the grounds that 
his mother's financial position was above the allowable minimum, although City 
officials conceded that their criteria for deciding minimums were "subjective." 
</P>
<P>
The Burwells then felt forced to change their plea to emotional hardship, but 
that only turned the situation ugly. Burwell, who is black, said racial tension 
had made it impossible for him to continue going to Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
His former teammates called him a troublemaker and a negative person. Cleveland 
coaches accused City Section officials of carrying on a vendetta against the 
Cavaliers. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "All of this is really putting the family through the wringer," his 
mother, Sharon Burwell, said at the time. "Sean's been depressed. It's been 
very hard on us." 
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, reason eventually prevailed. On Oct. 9, 1987, two games into the 
season, a three-member City appeals panel ruled that Burwell did indeed have 
both emotional and financial hardship and made him eligible to play at 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
Three hours after the judgment, Burwell played in the Cavaliers' 27-6 loss to 
Taft, rushing for 55 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"I was upset" about missing the season's first two games, Burwell said. "I 
didn't understand them not letting me play. I should have been able to go to 
public school where I wanted and have all the privileges a regular student 
had." 
</P>
<P>
After the eligibility controversy, Burwell's junior year was anticlimactic. He 
gained only 256 yards in 69 carries but made All-Valley 4-A League as a 
defensive back. 
</P>
<P>
While Burwell had trouble getting on the field his junior year, Cleveland 
coaches couldn't keep him off it his senior year. Burwell played all 48 minutes 
of every game, rushing for 1,145 yards, including a torrid five-game stretch 
during which he averaged 8.6 yards a carry and gained a career-high 225 yards 
against Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
But his offensive exploits went largely ignored -- thanks to the presence of 
Russell White. 
</P>
<P>
Burwell did get named West Valley League defensive most valuable player and 
made The Times' All-Valley first team as a defensive back, but he was 
determined to play offense in college, so he made it known to recruiters that 
his defensive days were over. 
</P>
<P>
"I like offense better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the angst of transferring schools in 1987, Burwell believes it was all 
worthwhile. "Switching schools helped me get recruited" by Division I teams, he 
said. "I know I would have done good at Chaminade, but I may have been 
overlooked because it was such a small school. It was a lot easier getting a 
ride coming out of Cleveland." 
</P>
<P>
Burwell went to Oregon expecting to play right away but was shocked to discover 
that the freshman class was going to be redshirted. "At first it frustrated 
me," he said, "but then it didn't bother me." 
</P>
<P>
In spring practice this year, Burwell competed with Ngalu Kelemeni for the 
tailback position. 
</P>
<P>
The two alternated as starters in the Ducks' first three games until Burwell 
won the job permanently and went on to become the fourth-leading rusher in the 
Pacific 10 Conference with 949 yards. 
</P>
<P>
A back injury limited his playing time in the season-ending Oregon State game 
and probably prevented him from being the first Duck freshman to rush for 1,000 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
"If you give him a little space, he's an explosive player," Oregon Coach Rich 
Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite his impressive statistics in only his first year playing big-time 
college football, Burwell "hasn't thought about playing in the pros," he said. 
"I'm just concentrating on being a good college player." 
</P>
<P>
And he promises not to even think about transferring.

Tisa Rush scored 23 points and four other players scored in double figures to 
pace Valley College to an 84-67 victory over El Camino on Thursday in the first 
round of the Fullerton tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs (14-1), who have won nine consecutive games since losing to 
Moorpark, were ranked No. 1 in the state in the latest J.C. Athletic Bureau 
rankings. 
</P>

The Monarchs made nine three-point baskets, erasing the school record of seven 
set in 1986-87. Rush and Sylvia Castaneda each had three. Castaneda scored 15 
points and Katina Mines, Roz Linton and Wendy Bruse each finished with 12 for 
the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
In another first-round Fullerton tournament game: 
</P>
<P>
Canyons 91, Long Beach City 69 -- Shannon Solway had 24 points and 10 rebounds 
to lead the Cougars. Guards Keira Irwin (six assists) and Shawnee Danels 
(seven) had little trouble breaking Long Beach's full-court press. 
</P>
<P>
MEN 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley 99, Cerritos 86 -- J. R. Rider scored 36 points and teammate

CSUN'S FISHER WAITS, HOPING FOR NEW GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Whether Cal State Northridge basketball center Percy Fisher regains his 
eligibility hinges on his efforts to have a D+ grade changed to a C-. 
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who learned late Wednesday that he was 0.01 shy of the cumulative 2.0 
grade-point average required, was so shocked by his history grade that he 
thought a mistake had been made. 
</P>
<P>
"I hope there was a mistake and I hope there is a change in his favor," CSUN 
Coach Pete Cassidy said, noting that it is not uncommon for grades to be 
changed for regular students after they are posted. 
</P>
<P>
"(But) coaches can't talk to professors," Cassidy added. "It is a university 
rule and it is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
Erik Cooper, who also missed the first semester because of academic 
ineligibility, is still waiting for all of his grades to be posted. 
</P>
<P>
Cooper and Fisher have struggled academically despite the efforts of Cassidy 
and his staff, which include monitoring classroom attendance. 
</P>
<P>
"We do the best we can," Cassidy said. "Can you wake a kid up in the morning 
and walk him around campus? When we find out they are negligent we call them to 
task, but there is a time when a man has to stand up and be counted. They know 
the importance of this." THERESA MUNOZ

SAUGUS CONTINUES ROLL WITH DECISIVE VICTORY

Saugus High Coach John Clark remembers Dec. 10 well -- the day of a seven-point 
loss to Rio Mesa in the first round of the Beverly Hills tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We played absolutely terrible," Clark said. "We shot poorly and were selfish. 
I lectured their butt off for about 35 minutes. I challenged them to put it on 
the line." 
</P>
<P>
Saugus rose to the occasion Thursday night in a 74-33 victory over San Fernando 
in a championship quarterfinal of the Hart tournament to notch its fourth win 
in a row since a loss to Ventura in the consolation final of the Beverly Hills 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions (9-3) have scored 261 points in the past four games, an average 
of 65.3 points, while limiting opponents to 123 points (30.8). 
</P>
<P>
Saugus center Greg Yumbar scored a career-high 28 points and pulled down 12 
rebounds. Geoff Dains and Steve Tampus added 13 and 12 points. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus, which raced to a 22-4 advantage in the first quarter against Cabrillo 
in the first round Wednesday, built a 12-0 lead against San Fernando (4-7) with 
Jeromy Smith, who recorded five steals in the contest, scoring six of the 
Centurions' first eight points. 
</P>
<P>
Ruben Caballero scored the Tigers' first points with 3 minutes 48 seconds left 
in the period. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus defeated San Fernando, 77-55, earlier in the season in the Saugus 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We always try to pressure on defense," said Yumbar, a 6-foot-5 senior. "We 
have to hustle because our team isn't that big." 
</P>
<P>
Saugus led, 17-11, after the first period, but limited San Fernando to three 
points in the first six minutes of the second quarter and expanded its lead to 
36-14 with 2:21 left before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
Yumbar, who connected on 12 of 16 from the field, was five of five during the 
second-quarter run. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus made 27 of 53 from the field (50.9%) in the game and limited San 
Fernando to seven, nine and six points in the final three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
"We shot about as well as we could," Clark said. 
</P>
<P>
San Fernando did not score the final 2:12 after trailing, 63-33. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Riggio and Chris Hernandez each had six assists for Saugus, which will 
play Hart in the semifinals tonight at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
In other championship quarterfinal games: 
</P>
<P>
Hart 87, Calabasas 62 -- Hart scored 18 consecutive points in the third quarter 
to increase a 25-24 lead. Ali Peek, who was eight of 12 from the field, scored 
seven of his 19 points during the run. 
</P>
<P>
Keith Halcovich scored a game-high 20 points and Marty Downen added 17 for Hart 
(7-5). Peek and Downen each grabbed 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Jason Young led Calabasas (4-6) with 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley 64, Westlake 57 -- Brock Chase led Antelope Valley with 22 
points and John Van Spyk had 22 for Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
East Bakersfield 79, Glendale 71 -- Mike Wright and Hai Tran scored 15 and 14 
points for Glendale (6-5). East Bakersfield will meet Antelope Valley tonight 
at 6 in the other semifinal.

AFTER WINNING TITLE, EIGHT IS NOT ENOUGH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: ANTELOPE VALLEY CHRISTIAN WILL STEP UP TO 11-MAN VERSION ON THE HEELS 
OF A 13-0 CHAMPIONSHIP SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
In 1990, his football team scored 658 points and allowed only 88. The average 
margin of victory was 43 points, the team posted five shutouts and of its 13 
games -- all victories -- only four were completed; the others were ended 
because of the "mercy rule." 
</P>
<P>
And still Ted Knapp, the first-year coach of Antelope Valley Christian, feels 
obliged to make excuses for his players' individual statistics. 
</P>
<P>
"When it's over at halftime, it's hard to build up your stats," Knapp said. "My 
first teamers (were) frustrated about getting yanked." 
</P>
<P>
To keep the players happy, Knapp has found a new challenge for a team that went 
13-0 and won the Southern Section Eight-Man Small Schools Division title: The 
school will move up to play 11-man football next season. 
</P>
<P>
Valley-area schools such as Montclair Prep and Camp Kilpatrick have made the 
jump from eight-man to 11-man and enjoyed great success. There is reason to 
believe that Antelope Valley Christian, located in Lancaster, might follow in 
their cleat-steps. 
</P>
<P>
"I think they can make the move," said Viewpoint Coach Steve Sherman, whose 
team lost to the Eagles, 50-0, in midseason. "They have more athletes than 
other small schools, and that is the first thing they need. They have the 
talent and you can see that when they play. 
</P>
<P>
"Most eight-man teams don't pass well, (but) they do it with regularity. They 
also have the facilities, the equipment and the support. Those things should 
make it easier for Coach Knapp. Really, from a coaching standpoint, there isn't 
much of a difference." 
</P>
<P>
Besides being able to impress those on the field, Knapp has won backing from 
key administrators in the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything we have heard about playing 11-man is positive," Knapp said. 
"(Southern Section Commissioner) Stan Thomas is supporting our move and several 
football people have said we are ready." 
</P>
<P>
When Antelope Valley Christian begins practice next August, the team will be 
trying to develop some much-needed depth. The current roster numbers 27. The 
Eagles do have a junior varsity (4-0-1 last season) and additional players will 
come from that group. Still, Antelope Valley Christian, with an enrollment of 
95, will be one of the smallest schools in Division X. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Christian, a co-educational private school, has been in 
existence for only three years. In its first two years, the team won only three 
games. A school that is still somewhat unproven and certainly small, Antelope 
Valley Christian has not convinced everyone it is ready to play 11-man 
football. 
</P>
<P>
"I think the next step should be to the (eight-man) large division," said 
retiring Central Valley Christian Coach Keith Houtsma, whose team lost to the 
Eagles, 54-26, in this year's small schools final played Dec. 1. "They are 
going to have a tough time competing anywhere in the Southern Section. I don't 
think they can play with the Division 10 schools, and if they think they can 
they are going to have another think coming." 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley Christian already has scheduled Trona, Montclair Prep and 
Christian High in El Cajon for next season. The Eagles will play as a Division 
10 independent team in 1991 and move into the Desert-Inyo League in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
The players are confident after the success of this season. "I think we've 
proved we can play with anyone," sophomore quarterback Kris Kershaw said. 
"We've shown that we have what it takes to succeed. With some more success, 
some dads are going to start taking notice and may send their kids here instead 
of Quartz Hill and some other schools." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the top performances of this past season came from young players. 
Kershaw threw for 33 touchdowns, completed 65% of his passes and threw but one 
interception. Another sophomore, fullback Vinny Galis, averaged 9.6 yards a 
carry and scored 16 touchdowns. A linebacker on defense, Galis had 138 tackles 
and 13 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
Yet maybe the most important returnee is Knapp, 34, a proven coach who has 
compiled an 11-year record of 100-26-1, including six division or state titles 
in Georgia, Maryland, Alabama and California. All but two have been at the 
11-man level. 
</P>
<P>
"I want to move fast and I want to be dynamic," Knapp said. "I want to attract 
quality kids and I think the way to do that is to constantly build on your 
program. This is not a five-year program, this is a fast-as-you-can program."

FASHIONABLE FURNISHINGS;

<P>
BLANKET CASE FOR THE RUGGED LOOK

Whether you drape one over a sofa or over your shoulder, rugged wool blankets 
are all the rage. Yards of woolly Indian patterns, buffalo plaids and bold 
stripes in earthy reds and golds are on display this winter, both at home and 
on the fashion range. 
</P>
<P>
The "Twin Peaks" factor seems to be encouraging the trend. The Northwest 
produced all those Pendleton Mills (as in Pendleton, Ore.) blankets and shawls 
now found at flea markets and in such upscale antique stores as Indigo Seas, 
which provided items for the horsy corner (pictured). Environmental, 
save-the-forest concerns may also be subtly inspiring the northern-woods look. 
</P>
<P>
And such designers as Ralph Lauren and Calvin Klein have been glorifying 
anoraks and outsdoorsy sportswear of all kinds. Whatever the inspiration, 
fashion and interior designers are on the same wavelength, and it's 
all-American. 
</P>
<P>
Shown here is I. Magnin Design Studio's Indian blanket coat, $225, at all I. 
Magnin stores. Pendleton blankets are $300, Mexican blankets are $400, and 
serape-covered cushions are $115, all at Indigo Seas, 123 N. Robertson Blvd., 
Los Angeles. BETTY GOODWIN

<P>
RING IN THE NEW YEAR WITH FESTIVE FROCKS THAT GO FOR $100 OR LESS

<P>
New Year's Eve outfits for about $100 are easier to find than most women might 
expect. Post-holiday markdowns help, so does some creative thinking about how 
to spruce up what you already own. 
</P>
<P>
At ClothesTime, a bargain-hunter's paradise, there are velvet cocktail dresses 
for less than $40 and sweaters trimmed in gold ribbon for less than $30. 
</P>
<P>
Other stores, including Whip Cream in the Beverly Center, have marked down some 
holiday items as much as 50%. "Our customers are more cost-conscious this year, 
and looking for sales," says Chris Coyle, manager of Whip Cream. Even at full 
price, party fare at the store, which specializes in junior fashions, ranges 
from $70 to $98. 
</P>
<P>
For women whose budgets best fit a new accessory, not an outfit, shoe ornaments 
have become a favorite wardrobe reviver. Nordstrom stores and Le Petite Jean, a 
Beverly Hills shoe store, stock elegant clip-on shoe ornaments, encrusted with 
faux pearls, rhinestones, bows and other trims, priced from $7.95 to $50. 
</P>
<P>
Scarfs in festive fabrics can dress up a plain sweater, tunic or evening 
jacket. At Robinson's, a solid sequined scarf by Oscar de la Renta sells for 
$60. 
</P>
<P>
Deborah Harmon, a Sherman Oaks actress, takes an imaginative approach to 
accessories. She bought a large scarf in black crepe with gold soutache trim to 
wear as a sarong on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
CBS senior publicist Lori Huhn combats outfit fatigue by mixing old and new. 
For this New Year's Eve, the Manhattan Beach resident and infrequent party-goer 
decided to pair a new, black lace skirt with a chiffon-sleeved black jacket 
already in her closet. She added a new hat to complete the ensemble. Total 
investment: $80. 
</P>
<P>
Another money-saving tip: Shop resale stores. April, a new Long Beach 
consignment store, recently sold a gently worn, red wool jersey dress by Donna 
Karan for $100, a fraction of the original cost. 
</P>
<P>
For the most temporary yet trendy looks of all, rental stores such as Dressed 
to Kill in West Hollywood will loan big-name designer chic for about $150. The 
fee buys an evening with a Bob Mackie black velvet short cocktail dress with 
gold lame trim, or a black strapless Gianni Versace cocktail number. Given the 
holiday crunch, the by-appointment-only store suggests a week's notice.

STUCK WITH THE DOGS OF WINTER; 
</P>
<P>
MARKETING: AS RETAILERS ADD UP THEIR HOLIDAY SALES, SEVERAL MUCH-BALLYHOOED 
PRODUCTS STAND OUT AS DUDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Neon bicycle pants and T-shirts flickered out. Books about the environment are 
heading to the dump. And the movie "Bonfire of the Vanities" is going up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
In a Christmas season of weak consumer spending and widespread economic pain, 
these seem to be among the biggest commercial flops. 
</P>
<P>
Marketers went into the holidays knowing that Americans were worried about the 
economy and reluctant to part with their dollars. So, many merchants took few 
chances -- by and large, they stocked their shelves with conservative fashions 
or products that appeared to be proven winners. 
</P>
<P>
Stores also tried to keep their inventories lean to avoid getting stuck with 
piles of surprise losers. "We didn't have any big dogs," said Gail Dorn, a 
spokeswoman for Target Stores. 
</P>
<P>
Still, there were Christmas duds aplenty. Take, for example, the parade of 
dolls designed to compete with Mattel's ever-popular Barbie. 
</P>
<P>
Among them were Matchbox's Real Models, including likenesses of Christie 
Brinkley, Cheryl Tiegs and Beverly Johnson. They found out that Barbie is one 
tough cookie. 
</P>
<P>
"Anyone who goes against Barbie gets their head handed to them," said Larry 
Carlat, editor of the trade publication Toy &amp; Hobby World. "Most little 
girls see these dolls as Barbie's friends, and girls would rather have Barbie 
than a friend." 
</P>
<P>
Likewise, action figures aimed mainly at boys -- among them, Beetlejuice and 
Police Academy characters -- were thrashed by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, 
a repeat hit from last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Not that all of last year's hot toys thrived again this year. Sales of Micro 
Machines -- inch-long replicas of cars -- sped downhill. In fact, many 
consumers turned away from the favorites of past years in the toy business and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
Carlat said the action figures based on the hit television show, "The 
Simpsons," weren't "an out-and-out bomb or a stiff, but they didn't do nearly 
as well as expected." He said the figures arrived in toy stores too late, in 
October, after "Simpson mania" subsided. 
</P>
<P>
This year's books about the environment arrived too late and too numerous. 
"None of them sold," said an executive for Crown Books, the biggest bookseller 
in Southern California. "By the Christmas of 1990, people had had enough." 
</P>
<P>
"They all are on recycled paper, but it's still going to mean throwing away a 
lot of paper," the executive added. "That's the ironic thing." 
</P>
<P>
One of Crown's biggest disappointments: "Just a Dream," a children's story 
about ecology, written by Chris Van Allsburg, author of the previous 
best-seller "Polar Express." 
</P>
<P>
Expensive gift and coffee table books also faltered, with the $30 price level 
being a breaking point. But there was at least one major exception to the rule: 
One of the season's biggest hits was "The Civil War: An Illustrated History," a 
companion to the public television miniseries. It sold at some chains for the 
full list price of $50. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cookbooks staged a comeback. Biographies and autobiographies also 
did relatively well, including books about movie actress Ava Gardner, football 
and baseball star Bo Jackson and television newsman Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
But former President Ronald Reagan's memoir, "An American Life," was a 
disappointment even though it made the best-seller lists. It trailed "Millie's 
Book," the dog's-eye view of the White House ghost-written by First Lady 
Barbara Bush. 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a joke in the industry," said Neal Webb, marketing director for 
Ingram Book Co., one of the nation's biggest book wholesalers. 
</P>
<P>
In the fashion business, the neon fad faded, particularly on skin-tight bicycle 
pants. Why? 
</P>
<P>
"The bulk of the baby boomers are now past 40, and they can't afford 
liposuction," said Alan Millstein, publisher of Fashion Network Report. 
</P>
<P>
Loose sweat suits fared much better, and men's neckties with bold or playful 
prints were an undisputed hit. 
</P>
<P>
Other mass market fashion flops were corduroy, cowboy boots and, in particular, 
suede and leather coats. Millstein explained that because leather is so 
durable, many people who bought flight jackets and other leather apparel in 
past years don't need to replace it yet. 
</P>
<P>
In the sluggish consumer electronics business, electronic piano keyboards were 
probably the biggest disappointment, said Louis Block, vice president of 
merchandising for the Philadelphia-based Silo chain. After several years of 
selling briskly, keyboards are being hurt by competition from Nintendo and 
other video games, Bloch said. 
</P>
<P>
One of the biggest hits of the season, though, also was a consumer electronics 
product: the $60 Video Plus, an easy-to-use remote-control device for 
programming VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
Along with buying gifts, people normally flock to the movies during the 
holidays. This year, though, such highly promoted films as "Bonfire of the 
Vanities" and "Havana" have gotten off to weak starts. "Rockie V" also has been 
less than a knockout. 
</P>
<P>
Their box office receipts may have been hurt by the glut of holiday season 
releases, with nine major films coming out since Dec. 19. In some cases, pans 
by critics may have hurt too. 
</P>
<P>
Citing two of the biggest Christmas hits, "Kindergarten Cop" and "Home Alone," 
analyst Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler Amdec Securities suggested that "stories won 
out over stars." He said moviegoers also seem interested in cheerful stories, 
perhaps as an escape from all of the economic gloom. 
</P>
<P>
A notable exception was the explosive box office debut on Christmas Day of "The 
Godfather Part III," which Logsdon attributed partly to the loyal following 
developed by the first two Godfather movies. 
</P>
<P>
Novelty items, as usual, had mixed results. Neiman Marcus stores, the tony 
retailer long known for its fancy, unconventional gifts, fared well with its 
$95 Silly Putty in an engraved sterling silver egg. The chain also succeeded 
with the 18-karat Golden Slinky, which went for $55. 
</P>
<P>
But Neiman Marcus' 25-hour clock, costing $82, was a disaster. Its claim to 
fame is that it shaves 2.4 seconds off of every minute, but what purpose that 
serves is anyone's guess. 
</P>
<P>
"I guess people don't want more hours in the day, they want fewer," said Neiman 
Marcus spokeswoman Pat Zajac. "It must have something to do with stress 
management."

REP. HAMILTON URGES FED TO CUT RATES FURTHER; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE GOVERNMENT REPORTS THAT ORDERS FOR BIG-TICKET GOODS PLUNGED 10.5%, 
SIGNALING A MORE SEVERE RECESSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
WASHINGTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The chairman of the Congressional Joint Economic Committee urged the Federal 
Reserve Board on Thursday to cut interest rates further to revive the weakening 
economy and to ease pressure on the nation's fragile financial system. 
</P>
<P>
The comments by Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), panel chairman, came as the 
government disclosed more evidence of a deepening slump. On Thursday, it 
reported that factory orders for big-ticket durable goods plunged in November 
to their lowest levels in 2 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
The surprisingly large 10.5% drop in orders for big-ticket goods, such as 
aircraft and automobiles, followed a 3.6% increase in October and was far worse 
than analysts had expected. It represented the biggest monthly decline since 
last January and signaled that the recession may be deepening and spreading 
across the entire economy. 
</P>
<P>
And, separately, a new survey by the Conference Board, a New York-based 
economic research organization, confirmed Hamilton's assessment that Americans 
are increasingly concerned about both their personal finances and the state of 
the economy. 
</P>
<P>
The organization's index of consumer confidence fell again in December to 
roughly half of year-ago levels, as more and more Americans have come to 
believe that the economy is now in a recession. The New York-based business 
group's survey showed that consumers remain jittery and are wary about 
spending, contributing to the poor Christmas selling season reported by many of 
America's retailers. 
</P>
<P>
In a report that reviewed the current economic situation and surveyed prospects 
of 1991, Hamilton said it "feels like a recession" in the United States now, 
even if authorities have not officially acknowledged it. His report speculates 
that economists eventually will find that October was the month when the 
1990-91 recession began. 
</P>
<P>
"The economic expansion of the 1980s is over," Hamilton told a press conference 
here. "Excesses and policy mistakes are taking their toll." The 1980s -- which 
saw the creation of a huge buildup of debt by both corporations and consumers 
-- are coming back to haunt the economy in the more frugal 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
"It's going to be very tough going in the next few months" for Americans 
confronted with the nation's first recession in eight years, Hamilton added. "I 
think individual Americans are very uneasy about the economy right now and for 
very good reasons." 
</P>
<P>
Hamilton noted that the economic slump now seems "broadly based," with economic 
weakness most pronounced in construction but "with manufacturing not far 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
And he warned that the current slump may prove to be very different from and 
longer-lasting than other recent recessions, because the nation's banks, 
savings and loans and other financial institutions are so weak that they may 
not be able to lead the economy in a recovery. Many of those problems were 
building long before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait brought on a surge in oil 
prices that finally sent the economy over the edge into a recession, Hamilton 
observed. 
</P>
<P>
"The oil shock merely capped this process," he said. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, however, the panel's report cautioned against quick changes 
in the tax or budget laws in an attempt to stimulate the economy. With the 
government already running massive deficits, Congress and the White House 
should not try to modify last fall's budget accord to pump-prime the economy 
with lower taxes or increased federal spending, the document said. Such moves 
would only worsen the deficit and undermine Washington's first successful 
effort in years to reduce the government's flow of red ink. 
</P>
<P>
"Government spending programs to reverse an economic downturn seldom have their 
effect before the downturn is over," Hamilton observed. "Temporary tax cuts can 
be quicker, but temporary tax cuts have a way of becoming permanent, and the 
budget deficit is already too large." 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Hamilton argued that the deficit eventually will have to be cut even 
further than is called for under the five-year budget agreement that Congress 
passed last autumn. He said that while the economic slump will lead to 
larger-than-expected budget deficits in the next two years, the current 
agreement should not be altered to try to reduce those short-term problems.

Smoking Banned From EPA Offices: The Environmental Protection Agency announced 
that employees may no longer routinely smoke inside EPA offices and facilities. 
</P>
<P>
The EPA directive, aimed at protecting nonsmokers from passive smoke, applies 
to 120 agency facilities nationwide. The agency said employees will be provided 
with separate smoking lounges equipped with special ventilation systems. The 
new smoking policy comes as the EPA staff is considering a draft study that 
concludes there is considerable evidence that passive smoke causes lung cancer.

Hong Kong Millionaires Advised on Immigration: The U.S. Consulate began 
advising impatient Hong Kong millionaires on how to get in line for immigrant 
visas to the United States in return for $1-million investments in U.S. 
ventures. Under immigration law effective last month, visas will be granted to 
aliens able to invest at least $1 million in a venture that employs 10 or more 
Americans. Similar laws in Canada, Australia and Britain have caused tens of 
thousands of Hong Kong Chinese to seek immigration papers.

The Food and Drug Administration identified the brands as Orafix Special, Brace 
and, to a lesser degree, Cushion Grip. All three are being recalled by their 
manufacturers. Officials said there was no immediate health hazard but that it

DU PONT WORKERS' BET ON FIRM'S PROFIT DIDN'T PAY OFF; 
</P>
<P>
COMPENSATION: AN INCENTIVE PAY PLAN IS SCRAPPED AFTER THE FIBERS UNIT FAILED TO 
MEET ITS GOAL AND WORKERS DIDN'T GET BACK WHAT THEY INVESTED.

<P>
Workers in Du Pont Co.'s fibers division, who tied their pay raises to profits 
under a special incentive plan, had banked on a tidy payout around the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
But the bank went bust -- and so did the experimental program. 
</P>
<P>
Because the division failed to reach its $725-million annual profit goal, the 
department's 20,000 employees, who had as much as 4% of their pay at risk, 
won't see extra payouts or bonuses at year-end. 
</P>
<P>
Du Pont also decided to scrap the innovative three-year plan in its second year 
after several employees cried foul. Beginning in January, employee wages and 
raises will be paid in the traditional way. 
</P>
<P>
James F. Kearns, who heads the fibers division, said employees weren't ready 
for a pay-at-risk program. 
</P>
<P>
"It was fine when they were getting more back than they put in, which was the 
case last year. But when they found out they were not going to get back as much 
as they invested, it began to come out 'No, this is not fair,' " Kearns said. 
</P>
<P>
The pay incentive plan was mandatory for non-union employees at the 
department's 10 nationwide plants. Four of the five plants that have unions 
also agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Here's how the plan worked: 
</P>
<P>
Employees this year "gambled" as much as 4% of their annual pay that the 
division would reach its $725-million goal. Last year, it was as much as 2% on 
a $670-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
An employee with an annual salary of $30,000 this year could have received a 
one-time payout of as much as $1,200 if the goal were met. His or her regular 
salary, however, wasn't touched if the goal wasn't met. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, that same employee with the same salary earned an extra $600 because 
the goal was met, plus a small bonus because the target was exceeded. 
</P>
<P>
The Du Pont program was designed to give employees a stake in the department's 
profits to help improve the fibers business. The theory was that such a plan 
would make employees feel that they owned part of the company, encouraging them 
to become more efficient and to find cost-saving ways to do their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
But the fibers business, which represents nearly a quarter of Du Pont's total 
profit, has been hurt by a rise in foreign competition and raw materials costs. 
</P>
<P>
Through the third quarter of this year, Du Pont's fibers division earned $400 
million, about $100 million less than a year ago. The company predicts that 
fourth-quarter net income will be lower than the $191 million earned in the 
1989 quarter and, therefore, well below the $725-million goal. 
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, employees also could have received half of what was at risk if 
the department achieved 80% of this year's profit goal, or $580 million. 
</P>
<P>
But Kearns, the fibers division head, said it would take a "heroic effort" to 
reach that goal by year-end. 
</P>
<P>
When the pay plan was announced in the fall of 1988, chemical industry analysts 
said it was trend-setting. But in a slumping economy, it's not a popular plan. 
</P>
<P>
"I thought it was a pretty bold move. . . . (But) workers want stability in 
their job and compensation, and from that standpoint it may have been too bold 
a move," said James H. Wilbur, an industry analyst with Smith Barney, Harris 
Upham &amp; Co.

General Mills Inc. plans to spend about $65 million for the national 
introductions of Basic 4 and Triples -- breakfast cereals that it hopes will 
generate tasty profits. 
</P>
<P>
The promotional cost, estimated at $35 million for Triples and $30 million for 
Basic 4 over at least a year, is in line with the national rollout costs for 
cereals. 
</P>
<P>
Introducing a cereal costs $20 million to $30 million, said a spokesman for 
rival Kellogg Co. in Battle Creek, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
The expense of national rollouts and the proliferation of brands already on 
supermarket shelves, from 90 to more than 200 depending on the store, caused 
cereal introductions to slow in the past year, said William Maguire, an analyst 
with Merrill Lynch Research in New York. 
</P>
<P>
"The industry has come to realize the high cost of new-product introduction and 
realized that when you go to the market place . . . you've got to introduce a 
product that has some potential," said Kellogg's Joe Stewart, senior vice 
president of corporate affairs. 
</P>
<P>
Add to rollout costs the budgets for promoting existing brands -- figures not 
disclosed by the cereal companies for competitive reasons -- and marketing 
costs for breakfast cereals are tremendous. 
</P>
<P>
But the payoffs are great. U.S. retail cereal sales total anywhere from $5.5 
billion to $7 billion a year, according to industry sources and stock analysts. 
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, if a cereal achieves even a 1% share of such a large market, 
"you have a very successful cereal," said Craig Shulstad, a spokesman for 
General Mills, based in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're looking at 1%, that translates into sales of $70 million in the 
first year," he said. "That $70 million is a good return on an investment of 
$35 million." 
</P>
<P>
Shulstad said cereal is purchased by 95 of every 100 households. At any time, a 
household has more than one brand, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cereal consumption grew at about 3% a year from 1985 to 1989. In per-capita 
terms, the growth in consumption was even stronger, said John Bierbusse, an 
analyst with A. G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
But consumption slowed in 1990, Bierbusse said, partly because cereal price 
increases in the previous five years outpaced the consumer price index. Another 
factor, he said, was a loss in volume by industry leader Kellogg. 
</P>
<P>
"Their brand-name products have faced competition from General Mills, most 
notably, in selling products that have either better nutritional positioning or 
are more elaborate and have better price value," he said. "At the other end of 
the spectrum, their more mundane branded products, things like Corn Flakes and 
Raisin Bran, have suffered some market share erosion to private-label products 
who compete on the basis of price." 
</P>
<P>
When measured in terms of tonnage sold, Bierbusse said, Kellogg has a 38% 
market share, followed by General Mills with 24%; General Foods Corp., 11%; 
Quaker Oats Co., 7%; Ralston Purina Co., 6%; Nabisco Brands Inc., 4.5%; private 
labels, 6%, and all others, 2.5%. 
</P>
<P>
Bierbusse said "it is a fact that the industry leader has not been able to 
introduce a successful new-product for the last several years." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg's Stewart said the company is active in new product introductions. 
</P>
<P>
He pointed to Oat Bake, "introduced at the height of the oat craze," Common 
Sense Oat Bran and Ken Mei Rice Bran, introduced recently. 
</P>
<P>
Stewart said the key factor for success in the industry is the quality of a 
company's cereals, "the ability to provide customers with that value," rather 
than the quantity of brands available. 
</P>
<P>
The characteristics of a successful cereal have changed little since Kellogg 
introduced its Corn Flakes in 1906, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It has to taste right. It has to offer value to the customer, and it has to be 
in line with the perceived consumer need on health, fitness -- whatever that 
consumer is looking for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He said Kellogg is "extremely optimistic" about the cereal market's future, 
despite limited growth this year. Growth in the near future may be limited, he 
said, adding that health considerations position cereal to do well over the 
long term. 
</P>
<P>
"When you consider the health ramifications and the fact our society is moving 
from a treatment society to a disease-prevention society, then these 
grain-based products will play an increasingly meaningful role in a healthy 
diet," he said.

Being at the threshold is Herbert Lindo's seduction and curse. He has been 
verging on success for so long that even he concedes the peculiarity of 
gambling more than $20 million and nearly two decades on a breakthrough that 
was always just around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
Thus it is with tremendous glee that Lindo says triumph is now within reach. 
"It took Xerox 17 years before it became known," Lindo declares. "We're in our 
17th year. It's my time." 
</P>
<P>
Those numbers are a little off. Lindo's company, Kenilworth Systems Corp., has 
been around for 18 years, and the copier giant's great leap took about 21. But 
Lindo is talking about revenue so large that arguing over dates would be picky. 
</P>
<P>
The Melville, N.Y., company has developed a cashless betting system that made 
its world debut a month ago in the Australian state of Victoria. In its first 
24 days of operation, the unique Tabaret casino in Melbourne drew 20,000 
gamblers who spent 10 million Australian dollars, the equivalent of $7.7 
million here. "That's not bad, is it?" asks Rhett Kirkwood, a spokesman for the 
Tabaret agency. 
</P>
<P>
Victoria's decision to run cashless casinos with Kenilworth's technology has 
given the company a revenue stream and, perhaps most important, credibility. 
This is a company that once was seized by the Internal Revenue Service, that 
has survived bankruptcy and that hasn't held a shareholders' meeting in two 
years because of the expense. It also is one that will need a lot more money to 
keep the pump primed. 
</P>
<P>
If the gusher comes, Lindo says, the company could be awash in sales, perhaps 
$40 million annually two years from now. "I have demonstrated something in 18 
years," says its 65-year-old president. "That I have staying power, the will to 
continue and the understanding of what the market is." 
</P>
<P>
That market is gambling, a labor-intensive industry whose profit is tumbling 
even though revenue is rising. In Lindo's view, casino operators should rush to 
embrace a technology that could cut their operating costs by as much as 60%. So 
far, they are not. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be when you ran a casino, all you had to know was how to open the 
door," Lindo says. Gamblers still come, but, especially in Atlantic City, most 
are low-rollers who bet on a budget. 
</P>
<P>
"The cost of booking a $100 bet at a casino is the same as booking a $1 bet," 
says Jeffrey Lindo, Herb's 38-year-old son and Kenilworth's executive vice 
president. "The problem is there's less and less $100 bettors and more and more 
$1 bettors." 
</P>
<P>
Much of the huge overhead is the expense of dealing in cash. There are costly 
accounting systems to prevent skimming, elaborate security systems to keep 
employees out of the till and the cost of handling cash itself. "They wrap and 
count more money than the Federal Reserve," Jeffrey Lindo says. 
</P>
<P>
"Quite frankly," his father says, "we feel that unless the gaming industry 
takes the cash out of gaming, the gaming industry isn't going to make any 
money." 
</P>
<P>
This they could do with Kenilworth's system, which is based on electronic 
transfer of funds. A gambler deposits money with a cashier, who opens an 
account that is activated by a special plastic card. The gambler inserts the 
card in a slot machine and plays as usual, except that winnings and losses are 
tracked in the bettor's account. There is no money except at the cashier's 
cage, and thus no expense in handling it. Computers record the transfers as 
they do in a brokerage or bank. 
</P>
<P>
With the Totalizator Agency Board of Victoria, a state-run operation, 
Kenilworth combined its special cards and software with a video machine that 
works like an automated teller machine. A bettor inserts the card and touches 
the screen to choose from a variety of games and select the amount of the bet. 
</P>
<P>
Odds are programmed as they are now, and winning combinations -- the number of 
pins knocked over in the bowling game, for example -- are randomly generated by 
the computer. Gamblers at the Tabaret can play video games or use other 
terminals to bet on live events, such as races. 
</P>
<P>
"This machine has nothing mechanical in it," Herb Lindo says. "It has no parts 
to jam. There's no money to collect, nothing. There's nothing to steal, nothing 
to take -- and if that isn't attractive to the industry, then I don't know what 
is." 
</P>
<P>
One fear of operators is that gamblers will not like a cashless casino. Another 
is that the system will not work, an anxiety that Kenilworth believes will 
disappear as it proves itself in Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
The heart of the system is Kenilworth's chemically encoded card, which was 
developed as a means of identification in high-security nuclear power plants. 
That business rose and then fell with the nuclear industry, and the Lindos 
decided they'd better find another market for their special cards. 
</P>
<P>
The banking and credit-card industries were closed to Kenilworth because 
billions of dollars had already been spent on cards that hold information on a 
magnetic strip. What the Lindos needed was a cash-intensive industry in need of 
modernizing. 
</P>
<P>
That turned out to be gambling, an industry that last year, according to Herb 
Lindo, took in $245 billion, legally and illegally, in the United States alone. 
Lindo calls legalized gambling "painless taxation" and says the Kenilworth 
system keeps it clean. 
</P>
<P>
Developing a fraud-proof system was an enormous challenge that called for more 
and more research and investment. They also lost several years, Herb Lindo 
says, when they had to go back to develop an interim system that takes coins 
and cards -- to reduce the industry's anxiety about whether gamblers would miss 
the coins. They also have simulated that seductive clanking as a jackpot hits 
the hopper. 
</P>
<P>
The Lindos' apparent success in Australia actually puts them at the brink of a 
new crisis, which is that a tiny company will have trouble generating 
confidence, not to mention being vulnerable to organized crime. "We either have 
to very quickly become a big company or we have to look for Big Brother," Lindo 
says. "The way to a big brother is to book a lot of sales." 
</P>
<P>
The Australian experience is the beginning of that. The 221 machines of the 
Melbourne Tabaret will soon be supplemented with the opening of four more 
casinos and an expansion that could lead to more than 9,000 machines in 
Victoria alone. Kenilworth and the Totalizator Agency Board also are 
negotiating a joint venture that would let them sell systems worldwide. Casinos 
in Asia are said to be very interested. 
</P>
<P>
And a major casino in Las Vegas has agreed to test Kenilworth's system for 
three to six months while the state gaming commission decides whether to 
approve it for use in Nevada. The other side of the coin, though, is that 
Kenilworth has to foot the bill for a system and 300 machines. They need $6 
million the company doesn't have, but has no choice about investing. 
</P>
<P>
"When I have these orders, you can bet your bottom dollar that the vultures, 
the big companies, will come and look," Lindo says. 
</P>
<P>
He is confident, but doesn't rule out a bad hand. "When somebody buys a stock 
for 20 cents, I hope to heck he didn't think he bought IBM," he says.

LATIN AMERICA TAKES STEPS TO STOP TOXIC IMPORTS FROM U.S.; 
</P>
<P>
ENVIRONMENT: EVERYTHING FROM HOUSEHOLD TRASH TO RADIOACTIVE SLUDGE IS DUMPED IN 
THE REGION, CAUSING A VARIETY OF LIFE-THREATENING DISORDERS.

U.S. and European companies dump millions of tons of toxic waste in Latin 
America every year, leaving poisonous residues that health officials say will 
endanger lives for decades. 
</P>
<P>
Everything from household trash to radioactive sludge is sent to the region 
because lax anti-pollution laws make disposal easier and cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
Waste exporters say they are doing nothing wrong, but environmentalists claim 
that Latin Americans are not being told the full story behind the toxic garbage 
they receive. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists in Brazil say the toxic waste, dumped haphazardly in rivers, 
marshlands or earth wells since the late 1960s, causes cancers, birth defects, 
nerve damage and blood disorders. 
</P>
<P>
"This is an illicit trade, shrouded in secrecy and often done by small 
unregistered companies, that is devastating the environment and will affect 
generations to come," said Dr. Anthony Wong, president of the Brazilian Society 
of Toxicology and director of the Sao Paulo Poison Control Center. 
</P>
<P>
No precise figures are available for Latin America, but Mostafa Tolla, director 
of the U.N. Environmental Program, estimates that 40 million tons of toxic 
waste entered the Third World in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, which generates 275 million tons of hazardous garbage a 
year, is the world's leading waste exporter. 
</P>
<P>
American companies wanting to export hazardous waste must tell the 
Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
Such notifications rose from 12 in 1980 to 626 in 1989. A growing share of the 
waste went to Brazil, Mexico, Argentina and the Caribbean, according to EPA 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
"Latin America is a perfect dumping ground," said Rubens Born, director in 
Brazil for Greenpeace, the international environmental group. "There's lots of 
space, loads of corrupt inspectors and widespread ignorance of the problem." 
</P>
<P>
Waste exporters say wastes are tightly monitored by the EPA and shipments could 
not leave the United States if they contained dangerous levels of toxins. They 
also say the disposal methods they practice in foreign countries are comparable 
to those in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
Latin health officials argue that poorly paid, ill-equipped port inspectors are 
easily bribed to sign consent forms for importing hazardous waste or to look 
the other way when cargoes are disposed of illegally. 
</P>
<P>
U.S. law says foreign countries must be notified about waste shipments, but 
many Latin governments complain about the quality of the information. 
</P>
<P>
"The information we receive from the U.S. EPA is grossly misleading," said Dr. 
Waldemar F. Almeida, head of Brazil's National Institute of Health Quality 
Control. "We are rarely informed of the quantity, the type of waste or its 
destination." 
</P>
<P>
Wendy Grieder, director of the EPA's international office in Washington, 
responded in a telephone interview: 
</P>
<P>
"Waste is shipped with the understanding of all countries involved. Latin 
countries are told through our embassies what kind of waste they are getting, 
how much and the point of exit and entry." 
</P>
<P>
A 1988 report by the EPA inspector general said, however, that the agency did 
not know how much waste was shipped abroad or which exporters failed to comply 
with requirements for notification of intent. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms often approach debt-ridden Latin governments with offers of 
public works projects or increased investment in return for permission to dump 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, a New York company offered to build schools, hospitals and roads in 
San Clemente, Peru, in return for the right to dispose of incinerator ash near 
the city. After public protests, Peruvian officials rejected the offer. 
</P>
<P>
On July 7, 1989, Summit Cement &amp; Development Corp. asked the Bahamian 
government for permission to blend 88,000 tons a year of hazardous solvents 
with prime fuels to fire cement kilns on Grand Bahama Island, according to 
company documents. 
</P>
<P>
In return, Summit promised to create 180 jobs and give $4.5 million to the 
Caribbean island. The government turned the offer down. 
</P>
<P>
"Hazardous wastes would have been unloaded and burned 50 yards from where 
cruise ships dock in the harbor," said Edward St. George, chairman of the 
Bahamas Port Authority. "For a few jobs, we would have polluted the island and 
severely damaged our reputation with tourists." 
</P>
<P>
The Associated Press telephoned several times to the office of the company 
owner, Finn Moller, in Alhambra. His secretary said he would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
Chile, Argentina, Guatemala and Bolivia have received offers from U.S. and 
European companies to build incinerators and dump sites for foreign waste, 
government officials of those countries told the AP. All offers were refused. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Vallette, a Greenpeace coordinator in Washington, said: "These governments 
have so far resisted pressure to enter potentially lucrative dumping contracts 
because nationalists will accuse them of pandering to Uncle Sam's interests." 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists say the cash offers are tempting for Latin American 
governments, which have a combined foreign debt of more than $400 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We are being forced to choose between poverty and poison," said Juan Shroder, 
founder of the environmental group Earth Alert in Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
Some waste is intended for use in development projects. 
</P>
<P>
In January, International Energy Resources Inc. of Greenwich, Conn., offered to 
underwrite the cost of resurfacing 400 miles of roads in Guatemala with 5.5 
million tons of ash from U.S. municipal incinerators. 
</P>
<P>
The government backed out after Greenpeace told Guatemalan authorities the ash 
contained dangerous levels of arsenic, cadmium and mercury. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas Berardo, president of the company, said that the chemicals did not pose 
a health or ecological threat because the ash had been "washed" and that what 
toxicity remained would be immobilized when the ash was mixed with concrete. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything was done according to the EPA's specifications," he said. "This ash 
is clean."

REBOUND? Freedom Bowl ticket sales have declined since 1986 (above) when 
hometown UCLA played. The turnout has been even smaller, for 20% of 
ticketholders typically do not attend. . . . But organizers think the trend 
will be reversed at Saturday's game in Anaheim. About 52,000 tickets had been 
sold, including 10,000 donated to local military bases, and officials say 
game-day sales could bring the game close to a sellout. Bob Schwartz and Len

GHOST FLEET CARETAKER WON'T ABANDON SHIPS; 
</P>
<P>
MARITIME BATTLE: THE 66 VESSELS MOTHBALLED IN A CHANNEL ABOVE SAN FRANCISCO ARE 
READY FOR SERVICE IF NEEDED AGAIN, HE SAYS. CONGRESSIONAL CRITICS WANT TO JUNK 
THEM.

Scores of old rusting ships line a channel of an inland bay northeast of San 
Francisco, looming out of the fog like a fleet of Flying Dutchmen condemned to 
sail forever. 
</P>
<P>
And they will, if Charlie Johnston has his way. 
</P>
<P>
Congressional critics want to junk the 66-ship Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, but 
Johnston, caretaker of the "ghost fleet," says that the ships are ready to 
weigh anchor if the nation needs them again. 
</P>
<P>
"Many of these ships go back to service in World War II, Korea, Vietnam," said 
Johnston, 40, the fleet's acting superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
During the last session of Congress, the ships here and at Ft. Eustis, Va., and 
Beaumont, Tex., came under fire from the House Small Business Committee's 
subcommittee on regulation, business opportunities and energy. 
</P>
<P>
"The taxpayers are getting repeatedly fleeced . . . for these maritime 
cadavers," said Rep. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), subcommittee chairman. William S. 
Broomfield of Michigan, ranking Republican on the House Foreign Affairs 
Committee, described the ships as "glorified rust buckets." 
</P>
<P>
The array of ships that local landlubbers call the "mothball fleet" is 
impressive from a distance, however, and the spookiness that earned it the 
nickname "ghost fleet" is evident while approaching in a tugboat. 
</P>
<P>
They're tied in rows, anchored at the bow and stern and joined to one another 
by gangplanks. Almost all are gray, and rust stains their hulls. 
</P>
<P>
They include the Glomar Explorer, the CIA ship built to retrieve a sunken 
Soviet submarine. Since the secret voyage off Hawaii in 1974, the 618-foot ship 
has been waiting for a new role. 
</P>
<P>
"We keep the Explorer here for the Navy," Johnston said, explaining that the 
Glomar isn't Maritime Administration property, as nearly all the other ships 
are. 
</P>
<P>
You can't visit the Glomar, but the Meredith Victory, dubbed "The Gallant Lady" 
for rescuing thousands of Korean War refugees, can be boarded. 
</P>
<P>
Paint chips litter the deck, leaving metal naked to the elements and rust is 
everywhere. Painters used to keep busy on the fleet, but money ran out in the 
mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, to us rust is no big deal as long as the metal is sound," Johnston 
said as he stamped his foot to show the steel's hardness. "If it really got bad 
we could put another plate over it." 
</P>
<P>
Unlike the outside, the interior of the ship, built in 1945, is almost 
spotless. Charts, books, spare parts, bedding and other items are left where 
they were in 1971 when it returned from Vietnam. The lack of interior rust is 
maintained by systems that keep airborne moisture low. 
</P>
<P>
Below deck, it looks much like it must have in December, 1950, when it 
evacuated 14,000 Koreans as Chinese troops besieged the city of Hungnam. Five 
babies were born during the voyage that ended in Pusan on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
Could it be pulled into service again? 
</P>
<P>
It would take a presidential act to call out the reserve fleet, which is 
supposed to be ready to sail on 30 to 120 days' notice. The Ready Reserve, 96 
newer ships kept at several ports, was set up to carry heavy military gear on 
five to 20 days' notice. 
</P>
<P>
Much of the Ready Reserve, including some ships from here, were called up after 
Iraq invaded Kuwait in August. 
</P>
<P>
"(The ships) carried 90% of the Desert Shield equipment," Johnston said with 
obvious pride. "Planes just can't do it."

The battle against a forest fire that killed a Fontana firefighter was marked 
by the use of inexperienced crews and a lack of medical equipment, a report 
says. 
</P>
<P>
Whether those problems contributed to Kenneth Enslow's death or hampered 
efforts to rescue him has yet to be determined by authorities investigating 
last August's Mendocino National Forest fire. The accident report by U.S. 
Forest Service and state Department of Forestry and Fire officials was obtained 
by the San Bernardino Sun under the Freedom of Information Act. The 
firefighter's parents, Melvin and Valerie Enslow, criticized the lack of 
medical equipment and training cited by investigators.

A man convicted of molesting and killing his girlfriend's 8-year-old daughter, 
then dumping the body in a San Pedro park and setting it ablaze, was sentenced 
Thursday to 42 years to life in prison. Alejandro Lara, 30, was sentenced by 
Superior Court Commissioner Florence-Marie Cooper for the May 11, 1989, murder 
of Alba Susanna Flores. 
</P>
<P>
Lara was found guilty of murder, committing lewd acts upon a child and child 
abuse. The murder trial for the girl's mother, Natividad Flores, 28, begins 
next week. After her burning body was found in the park, her mother told police 
that the girl had left home in anger after being refused ice cream money. She 
later changed her story and said Alba was punished for refusing to take a bath. 
Police said the mother admitted hitting the girl with a broom handle, kicking 
her and tying her up with shoelaces in the apartment she shared with Lara.

CHAPMAN COLLEGE RENAMING SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Say "Chapman University." It doesn't exactly roll off the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
But if Chapman College President Allen E. Koenig has his way, the school will 
have a new name by 1992. And it is only one of the changes in store for the 
shady campus in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Chapman College, a private, four-year, Christian institution of 2,200 students, 
boasts a 130-year history, small classes and an ecumenical sense of morality 
that pervades its curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig, the school's 11th president, created a stir on the quiet campus when he 
came to Chapman in October, 1989, after a decade as president of Boston's 
Emerson College. He left the East Coast as a controversial, pro-growth 
president criticized for his efforts to move the school from its urban home and 
arrived at Chapman with a long list of plans to expand and improve academic 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
Some at Chapman worried that Koenig's goal to make the school a "medium-sized 
university" would lower the quality of education, with classes taught by 
professors who spent more time in the research lab than the classroom. Off 
campus, residents of the surrounding neighborhood feared that the school's 
growth would encroach on Old Towne, Orange's historical district. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig says Chapman is already a university in everything but name, and while 
he hopes the student body will grow to 3,000 in the next decade, he assures 
critics that growth will be gradual. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't consider us to be small now," Koenig said recently. "That is a 
stereotype perpetuated (by the media). We're really like a smaller university 
or perhaps a medium-sized university." 
</P>
<P>
The name change would be a way to "emphasize that we are small enough to be 
personal but large enough to be interesting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Koenig also believes a new name could help enrollment and will recommend the 
change to the Board of Trustees, but he said that if he does not have sweeping 
support, he will drop the issue. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he has implemented other, more substantive changes. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 administrative positions were cut or reorganized this summer so 
that funds could be freed to establish a center for ethics and values and a 
center for international studies. The school's Center for Economic Research is 
nationally recognized. 
</P>
<P>
In October, the faculty approved a new general-education curriculum that 
emphasizes "education for the global citizen." 
</P>
<P>
This month, groundbreaking took place for a new dorm, and construction of a 
student/faculty center is scheduled to begin in July. 
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, community leaders have fought construction at the college. They 
are protective of the area's early 20th-Century architecture and say Chapman 
has not included them in planning expansion of the campus. 
</P>
<P>
But Carole Walters, a community leader in the Chapman neighborhood, said 
working with the Koenig administration has been "like night and day." MARY

Gov. George Deukmejian on Thursday elevated Orange County Municipal Judge Frank 
F. Fasel to the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
Fasel, 51, of San Juan Capistrano, is a former Orange County deputy district 
attorney and Superior Court commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
He will fill the seat vacated by Judge Gary L. Taylor, who was appointed to the 
federal court earlier this year, the governor's office announced. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a straight shooter who will be good for both sides of the council table," 
said Marshall M. Schulman, a Santa Ana criminal attorney who has known Fasel 
since his days in the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
"He certainly deserves the elevation," Schulman said Thursday. "I've never 
heard anybody say a bad word about him." 
</P>
<P>
Fasel had been a commissioner for the Orange County Superior Court from 1980 to 
1989, when he was appointed to the West Judicial District municipal court. 
</P>
<P>
He is also a former Los Angeles County deputy district attorney, and worked as 
a deputy district attorney in Orange County from 1975 to 1979, the governor's 
office said. From 1979 to 1980, he was an attorney in the Santa Ana firm of 
Bunt &amp; Fasel. 
</P>
<P>
Fasel graduated from the University of Notre Dame in 1961 and earned a law 
degree from the University of San Diego in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
His new judgeship pays $94,344 a year, the governor's office said. SONNI EFRON

second rush of people coming from the bars at around 1:30 a.m." 
</P>
<P>
Over the holidays, the department has scheduled eight sobriety checkpoints in 
four South County cities -- Mission Viejo, Dana Point, Laguna Niguel and San 
Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
At their first checkpoint in early December, deputies stopped about 1,400 
vehicles and arrested nine people on suspicion of drunk driving. FRANK MESSINA

Day and night, strangers stroll past the Balboa Island home of Lorri Kemp 
Clarke, pausing to stare in her living room window. The attractions are several 
dollhouses that Clarke has painstakingly decorated with miniature furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
"At nighttime, we lay in bed upstairs and groups of people stand outside and 
talk about it," she said of her creations. "In another house they would be for 
us, but here, they're for everybody to see." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's childhood love of miniatures was rekindled seven years ago when her 
sister discovered Clarke's dollhouse furniture in the attic of the family home 
after their mother died. The childhood dollhouse has since been installed in 
one corner of Clarke's dining room, while two larger models dominate the living 
room. 
</P>
<P>
A peek into one -- a 30-inch, three-story Victorian dollhouse including 
wallpaper, carpet and furniture -- reveals a mini-world of opulence. A mahogany 
spiral staircase fills the entryway and a tiny grand piano stands nearby. In 
the dining room, a dainty crystal chandelier dangles above a Duncan Phyfe 
dining room set. A sterling silver tea set rests on the tea cart and 
hand-painted china fills the cupboards. 
</P>
<P>
On the second floor, a miniature bathroom boasts a free-standing porcelain 
bathtub with 24-carat gold feet and fixtures. A lace-canopied bed in one of the 
bedrooms was the first piece of furniture Clarke bought for the house, which 
weighs 50 pounds unfurnished. She paid about $2,000 for the tiny bed three 
years ago, she said, adding that she scours shops throughout Southern 
California to find the miniatures. 
</P>
<P>
"It's fun to sort of shrink yourself down and imagine yourself in these rooms," 
Clarke said, kneeling to peer inside. "It's exactly like a real house." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, who also buys, remodels and sells real houses, created the Victorian 
dollhouse to "satisfy that craving" when she was unable to find a Victorian 
home to decorate. She tackles a miniature project as she would a larger one, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
"My fun is decorating just as a big decorator would do," she said. "You hire 
the wallpaper man. You hire the electrician." 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's hobby has even taken over the kitchen. She has created a scaled-down 
sweet shop on the counter, with a soda fountain, table and chairs, and a 
display case packed with tiny cakes, eclairs, jelly donuts and cinnamon rolls. 
</P>
<P>
One doorless cupboard has been transformed into a display room for diminutive 
stoves, refrigerators and washing machines, which Clarke said her uncle used as 
models when selling appliances during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
"These miniatures are just totally addictive," Clarke said. LESLIE EARNEST

" I have made up my mind that the 1990s is my decade to retire from education. 
I think I have been a highly intense person in terms of my career, and I have 
been reflecting on that and working on bringing a balance in my life with a 
mixture of hard work and also taking time out for myself. 
</P>
<P>
I think that as a nation we have hit rock bottom in terms of supporting our 
schools. But I'm not discouraged because I feel we have the attention of the 
leadership -- on the federal, state and local levels -- and that's what it's 
going to take. Either as an active public school administrator and/or as a 
private consultant, I will dedicate the remainder of my life to young people. 
I'm going to speak up and say, "If you want quality (education), you'll have to 
pay for it."

21 WILL VIE TO BE CITIES' FIRST COUNCIL MEMBERS

Twenty-one residents of El Toro and Laguna Hills have placed their names on the 
March 5 ballot to become council members if voters approve separate cityhood 
measures that day. 
</P>
<P>
The candidates who filed with the Orange County registrar of voters before 
Thursday's deadline include several who have campaigned for the creation of 
Orange County's 30th and 31st cities. 
</P>
<P>
With five council seats open in each city, there are 11 candidates in El Toro 
and 10 in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
And five of them have actually won council elections before, only to be denied 
their positions when voters simultaneously rejected companion cityhood 
measures: A referendum to create one large city for the Saddleback Valley was 
defeated in 1988. A year later, Laguna Hills voters turned down by a slim 
margin a smaller cityhood proposal. 
</P>
<P>
But after numerous compromises that resulted in the current plan -- 58,000 
citizens in El Toro and 23,000 citizens in Laguna Hills -- and the drawing of 
city boundaries that are acceptable to neighboring communities, little 
opposition to cityhood is expected in the March election. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the previously victorious candidates said they are hoping that this 
time, finally, they will be able to serve. 
</P>
<P>
Most contenders said this week that they will campaign to keep local taxes at a 
minimum, increase law enforcement, preserve neighborhoods, and improve parks 
and recreational facilities. 
</P>
<P>
According to records and interviews, the candidates for the El Toro council 
include: 
</P>
<P>
* Jim Berkey, whose age and occupation were unavailable Thursday.

</P>
<P>

HIGH TIDES, WINDS AND COLD PROMISE UNUSUAL WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mother Nature is pulling out all the stops this weekend in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to bone-chilling cold predicted by late Saturday, the county also 
will be buffeted by some of the highest tides of the year. 
</P>
<P>
The annual alignment of sun and moon will bring tides averaging 7.3 feet, 
starting Friday and culminating Monday. Tides could reach as high as 10 feet in 
some areas, weather forecasters said. 
</P>
<P>
The cold weather coming in will add to that spectacle, forecasters said. The 
Arctic storm could bring winds up to 25 m.p.h. by Sunday, and that could make 
for monster waves on Orange County beaches, according to forecasters. 
</P>
<P>
"The winds will be adding a couple of feet to already high tides, and that 
could make for waves 9 or 10 feet tall," said Steve Burback, a meteorologist 
with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
"December tends to have the highest tides of the year (for the Orange County 
area) because of the alignment of sun and moon. The tides will start going up 
Friday and will peak on Monday, then start going down again." 
</P>
<P>
Burback noted that Orange County also had tides averaging 7.3 feet on Dec. 2. 
The tide forecast for Monday -- New Year's Eve -- thus matches the Dec. 2 event 
as the twin highest tides of the year in the county, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Monday night also will feature the second full moon in the same month, Burback 
said. "When you have two full moons in the same month, the second one is called 
a blue moon," he said. "I'm not sure why it's called that." 
</P>
<P>
Patty Schooley, parks district supervisor for the county's Environmental 
Management Agency, said, "The weather forecast provided to us calls for short 
periods of waves 6 to 8 feet high during the high-tide period." 
</P>
<P>
Schooley said that short periods of waves that high pose no serious threat, but 
she added that the Environmental Management Agency nonetheless has alerted its 
rangers about possible problems from high surf over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"We're not anticipating problems, but we'll be prepared," said Schooley. 
</P>
<P>
Sgt. Tom Wallstrom of the Harbor Patrol office at Newport Beach said that he 
does not expect waves high enough to cause serious problems this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
"The (annual) high tides are nothing by themselves," he said. "It's only when 
they come with a strong wind that they can cause some problems." 
</P>
<P>
According to WeatherData, a mass of cold Arctic air moving south toward 
Southern California will drop temperatures into the 20s by Monday. Burback 
predicted that winds accompanying the cold front will be out of the northwest 
and will range from 15 to 25 m.p.h. "You'll see some pretty good waves coming 
on shore," he said.

Jason Bowman's 13-foot jump shot with 18 seconds remaining helped Inglewood 
High School to a 62-59 upset over Servite in the first round of the Katella 
Klassic Thursday night at Katella High School. 
</P>
<P>
Servite's Adam Anderson put the Friars ahead, 59-58, with 40 seconds to play 
after he rebounded a Friar miss and scored on a five-foot bank shot for the 
last of his 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
After Bowman (22 points) connected to give the Sentinels (7-6) a 60-59 lead, 
Servite's last chance went awry when Inglewood's Codi Evans (20 points) stole 
the ball from Eddie Rubio and made two free throws with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Servite (8-3) made 20 of 29 shots (69 percent) in the first three quarters, but 
went cold in the final period, making four of 14 attempts (29 percent). MICHAEL

<P>
CAL STATE FULLERTON: AARON WILHITE CONSIDERS HIMSELF A 'FULL-COURT' PLAYER, BUT 
HE'S INTRODUCED AS TITANS' STARTING CENTER.

FULLERTON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Being introduced by the public address announcer, strutting onto the court and 
slapping high-fives with teammates is an exhilarating experience for most 
basketball players, one of the perks of being a starter. 
</P>
<P>
But as much as Aaron Wilhite enjoys starting for Cal State Fullerton, he can't 
help but cringe sometimes when he is introduced in the Titans' lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 At center, a 6-foot-7 sophomore from San Diego, No. 32, Aaron Wilhite! 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Wilhite is shy or uncomfortable being the center of attention. 
He just dislikes being called a center. 
</P>
<P>
"I've always had a picture of a center being a 6-10 clumsy guy who only posts 
up," said Wilhite, Fullerton's leading rebounder (7.6 a game) and 
second-leading scorer (12.9 points) entering Saturday's game against Colorado 
State at 1 p.m. in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
"The stereotype of big men is they don't get the ball on the fast break and 
they don't take outside shots. I'm more of a full-court player." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite played all over the court at San Diego's Lincoln High School, where he 
averaged 24 points and 12 rebounds as a swingman in 1988-89 and was the San 
Diego Section 2-A player of the year. Wilhite shot from the outside, filled 
lanes on the fast break and posted up occasionally in three seasons as a 
varsity starter. 
</P>
<P>
But he has since become more of a full-figured player at Fullerton, growing one 
inch but gaining about 25 pounds since high school. "I grew out," the 
240-pounder says. 
</P>
<P>
And in Titan Coach John Sneed's run-by-numbers offense (1=point guard, 
2=shooting guard, 3=small forward, 4=power forward, 5=center), Wilhite -- 
though he doesn't fit the mold of a prototype center -- fits best in the No. 5 
position. 
</P>
<P>
Whether he likes it or not. 
</P>
<P>
"It doesn't bother me that much because the No. 4 and 5 positions are basically 
the same," Wilhite said. "I just don't like being introduced as a center. I've 
never really played it." 
</P>
<P>
But if it means helping the team and starting, Wilhite will play it. 
</P>
<P>
His game may be confined more to the inside than he likes, but Wilhite has 
adapted well, scoring in double figures in all eight games for Fullerton. Not 
surprisingly, his high game of 18 came against Mississippi Valley State, a 
wide-open, run-and-gun affair won by the Titans, 109-100. 
</P>
<P>
"I always figured because there were no special plays designed for me, if I 
scored in double figures it would be a miracle," said Wilhite, who averaged 3.7 
points a game last season. "That's one of the ultimate things I could do for 
the team, but if I didn't do it, it wouldn't matter as long as I rebounded 
well." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite's points have not come at the expense of rebounds, but many have come 
because of rebounds. Of his 61 rebounds this season, 29 have come on the 
offensive end.

"I was always taught in high school to go harder for offensive rebounds, 
because those are points," said Wilhite, who set a San Diego Section high 
school record with 39 rebounds in one game. "If you get two a quarter and get 
two putbacks, that's four points a quarter. It's just natural to go harder for 
offensive rebounds." 
</P>
<P>
Many of Wilhite's early season points came on follow shots, but he has been 
posting up more lately, scoring on inside jumpers. He has been one of the 
Titans' most accurate shooters, making 36 of 68 field-goal attempts for a .529 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
"That Mississippi Valley State game was the first time I've seen Aaron get 
vocal on the block and call for the ball," Fullerton Coach John Sneed said. 
"His confidence has come from age, maturity and hard work. His nickname is 
A-train, but I call him a plow-horse. He's a tireless worker." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite has had to work hard making the adjustment to center, a position he was 
unaccustomed to playing and surprised to be playing last season. 
</P>
<P>
"When I got to Fullerton, my game changed," Wilhite said. "They put me on the 
block and I had to learn how to play low-post. I was more of a perimeter player 
in high school, but now I'm lucky if I shoot from 10 feet out." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite said he didn't like playing in Sneed's system last season. Although 
Wilhite's media-guide biography credits high school coach Ron Loneski for 
"being one of the biggest influences" on his career, Loneski may have been 
partly responsible for Wilhite's rocky transition to college. 
</P>
<P>
"What messed me up is he said I was a 6-8 center when I was only a 6-6 
forward," Wilhite said. "A lot of schools recruited me as a center and I think 
Sneed had this picture in his head of a post-up guy. He put me in that position 
and we worked from there." 
</P>
<P>
Wilhite says it would be impossible for him to make the NBA as a center, so 
playing the position at Fullerton won't enhance his professional prospects. But 
Wilhite says he has no intentions of transferring to a school that would allow 
him to play another position. 
</P>
<P>
The business management major says he likes Fullerton and had a 3.1 grade-point 
average his freshman year. Besides, he realizes the NBA is a longshot -- a lot 
longer than most of his shots. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm comfortable where I am so I'll just go with the flow," Wilhite said. "I 
don't even think about the pros. I'm here to get an education and get something 
started for myself. I just want to succeed in life."

OVERBUILT TO THE HILT, O.C. OFFICE SPACE GOES BEGGING

<P>
Last month, a commercial real estate broker camped out in the lobby at Price 
Waterhouse for three hours until the partner in charge of the accounting firm's 
Newport Beach office agreed to see him. The broker had been told to stay all 
night if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse is leaving high-priced Newport Center and needs 40,000 square 
feet of office space, a sizable amount. So desperate are landlords to fill 
their empty buildings that the firm has been besieged with offers. (The broker, 
incidentally, didn't get a deal; Price Waterhouse had already narrowed its 
search to a few buildings.) 
</P>
<P>
Developers have built more than half of Orange County's 40 million square feet 
of first-class office space in the last five years. Eleven million square feet 
of it -- equal to 550 floors of the average high-rise office building -- sits 
vacant. 
</P>
<P>
Landlords charge rock-bottom rents, offer free parking, even part-ownership in 
the building -- anything to get tenants in the door. 
</P>
<P>
The construction boom was never totally driven by a need for all that space. 
The lenders simply had a lot of money to lend, and the development companies 
had grown so large that they had to either keep building or start to shrink. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, the tidal wave of construction finally slowed. The money 
dried up after the thrift industry crashed and the banks came under the worried 
scrutiny of federal regulators. But it appears to be too late. At the rate 
tenants leased new space last year, it will take four years to fill all the 
empty office space on the market. And there was 3 million more feet under 
construction near the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing's kind of scary," says Scott Perley, a commercial real estate 
broker. "The figures show that office space is still growing at 7% a year. But 
jobs in the service industries are only growing at 3%, and it'll probably be 
less next year." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, real estate is such a large part of Orange County's economy that the 
construction slump promises to make the recession here that much deeper. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a look at how four people in four different parts of the real estate 
business are coping with the downturn: 
</P>
<P>
At the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers offices in a rundown 
Santa Ana neighborhood, Bob Balgenorth is thinking about the last recession, 
when home builders broke the construction unions in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now construction is going down the tubes again and the big office and hotel 
projects that are the building unions' last toehold here are vanishing. Nine 
thousand construction workers lost their jobs in the last year, a big chunk of 
the 50,000 people unemployed in the county. 
</P>
<P>
Will the big construction companies take advantage of this recession to try to 
smash their unions, too? 
</P>
<P>
"Builders always kick that idea around," Balgenorth says. "The first thing that 
happens in a downturn is people say: 'Where can I cut costs? Can I cut out the 
union?' " 
</P>
<P>
The local IBEW is so weak compared to its counterparts in union towns such as 
New York that the 1,600-member local sometimes subsidizes part of its members' 
$24.90-an-hour wage so union contractors can bid for business as low as 
non-union contractors. 
</P>
<P>
That kind of thing, Balgenorth says, makes it harder to dislodge the local 
unions nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the places construction workers are likely to be looking for jobs in 
the next few years are in public-works programs such as highway construction, 
Balgenorth predicts. 
</P>
<P>
And on the bright side, the downturn may even bring local unions some new 
members, he says. 
</P>
<P>
"If you're working for a non-union guy for $12 an hour and he cuts your wage to 
$10, what are you going to do? 
</P>
<P>
"You're going to think about joining a union." 
</P>
<P>
Some people think it's significant that Ray Wirta, named president of the Koll 
Co. early this year, has spent much of his career in charge of managing 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
For that, they say, is how Koll and other developers are going to earn most of 
their money for at least the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
Look at the figures: Last year Koll developed 3.5 million square feet of space, 
an amount equal to about a third of New York's giant twin World Trade Center 
towers, enough to make the Newport Beach-based company the biggest developer on 
the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
This year, however, it was 3 million square feet. And next year, it'll be 1.5 
million, Wirta says. 
</P>
<P>
From his office on the top floor of Koll's sleek, three-story glass building, 
Wirta can look out on the urban canyons of the John Wayne Airport area, a 
neighborhood where only 20 years ago quail nested in open fields. 
</P>
<P>
Koll was the first big developer to see the potential in those fields. And it 
was one of the first to get rich partners -- insurance companies, savings and 
loans -- to put up all the money to build offices and warehouses, while Koll 
usually put only its expertise into the deal with little risk to itself. In 
this way, Koll and other companies used someone else's money to grow much 
larger than they could have otherwise. But they also helped build the glut of 
office space in places like Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
Now, some experts say that development companies such as Koll will eventually 
turn into just another type of service company, developing buildings for a fee 
for corporations planning to move into them. 
</P>
<P>
Not quite so, says Wirta, who predicts that the vacant offices and factories 
will fill up sooner than most people expect. That will mean new demand for the 
type of speculative buildings that Koll constructs with no particular tenant in 
mind, although probably less demand than in the past. 
</P>
<P>
"Most developers aren't interested in being employees," he says. "They're 
interested in the upside of building and owning real estate for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There'll always be those kinds of deals in this business," he adds. "After 
all, we're not building cars." 
</P>
<P>
A few miles down the San Diego Freeway, Dan Heinfeld shows a visitor the 
expansive view of the mountains from his new offices in an Irvine industrial 
park. 
</P>
<P>
LPA, an architectural firm, moved its sleek office furniture and drafting 
tables into the new building in May so that it would have room to expand. 
Instead, the firm laid off 15 of its 90 people over the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
The ripples from the construction slump are spreading to all sorts of other 
real estate businesses that once grew like weeds -- commercial brokerages, 
mortgage brokers, space-planning companies. 
</P>
<P>
Recently, jobs in the real estate industry stopped growing; in fact, they 
dropped by 400 or so in October, to 29,000. 
</P>
<P>
For the architects -- including LPA -- that means cutting fees to compete for a 
diminishing amount of work. 
</P>
<P>
But after the last recession, LPA began to branch out from designing "spec" 
buildings, risky projects built by developers who speculate that they will soon 
fill the building with tenants. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the new strategy backfired. For instance, LPA's first stab at an 
airport terminal -- at John Wayne Airport -- turned into a public relations 
disaster after millions of dollars in cost overruns. 
</P>
<P>
But now that there are far too many spec buildings sitting empty, and little 
reason to build more, diversification makes more sense. 
</P>
<P>
Taking up the slack are some projects that are smaller and less glamorous than 
a firm the size of LPA might have done in the past. The company is doing work 
for public agencies such as the state university system and city governments, 
which are more likely than private companies to build through a downturn. 
</P>
<P>
Says Heinfeld, president of the firm's Irvine office: "These days, there are 
very few of these jobs architects will turn up their noses at." 
</P>
<P>
A few months before the onset of a recession might not seem the best time to 
start a new company, but not, apparently, to Harold Street. In August, Street 
left the Koll Co. -- where he was a top executive for marketing and development 
-- to move around the corner into his own office. 
</P>
<P>
Now, he has hooked up with WSGP Partners L.P., a company started by former 
Treasury Secretary William Simon. WSGP used to be a financial partner with 
developers in building projects; now, it's turning into a buyer. 
</P>
<P>
WSGP has already rounded up Tokyo Fire &amp; Marine Casualty, the world's 
largest property and casualty insurance company, as a fellow investor. Street 
has a deal to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from Pacific Rim, European 
and American investors who might like to buy real estate over the next few 
years at bargain-basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
Why so cheap? One big reason: Thrifts that invested in real estate -- and must 
now sell within a few years under new federal regulations -- will be willing to 
make deals, Street says. Then there are the banks that will be foreclosing on 
buildings and will be anxious to get them off the books. 
</P>
<P>
And few buildings are being sold now, which means sellers will grow even more 
desperate. The Japanese, once big buyers, have troubles of their own with 
higher interest rates and declining real estate values at home. The big U.S. 
pension funds are waiting for prices to drop still further -- below what it 
would cost to build the buildings, real estate brokers say -- before scooping 
up values in what the industry calls "vulture" deals. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd advise people with capital to get ready for the period of the most 
opportunity I've ever seen," Street says, adding: 
</P>
<P>
"In another two years or so, there'll be an opportunity to acquire spectacular 
assets at historically low prices." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Building Boom Goes Bust 
</P>
<P>
After the recession of the early 1980s, there was a big demand for office space 
in Orange County, and developers rushed to meet it, bringing more than 6 
million square feet of space under construction in 1984. The figure didn't dip 
below 4 million square feet until 1989, after which the office vacancy rate 
dropped into the low 20% range and has stayed there. New construction appears 
to be slowing, but so does absorption, or the amount of new space taken off the 
market each year by tenants.

JOSEPH N. BELL: JOURNEY TO U.S.S.R. CHANGES PAIR'S LIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOSEPH N. BELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the profound bonuses of both teaching and the Christmas season is that 
ex-students frequently come back to Orange County for the holidays -- and 
frequently give me a call when they do. One who called a few days ago is Esther 
Bradley, fresh back from the Soviet Union (not Russia, she pointed out) -- and 
scheduled to go back there again in a few months. To stay. 
</P>
<P>
Esther Bradley came to my classroom at UC Irvine a dozen years ago, a single 
mother trying to put her life back together by completing her education. She 
was a free spirit who wrote that way, slightly out of control but always 
interesting. She was a legal secretary who wanted to be something else -- and 
had the tools to do it. She would check in with me periodically after she 
graduated, and two or three check-ins ago, sounding radiant, she told me that 
she was getting married to a man who approached even Esther's Technicolor 
fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
I had breakfast the other day with Esther and her husband of five years, a 
sprightly, animated, articulate computer scientist with a gray mustache and 
cropped wavy hair named Bill DeTally. He and Esther met through their common 
dedication to the Bahai faith, an independent world religion, founded in what 
is now Iran 150 years ago and dedicated to the promotion of a world 
civilization "characterized by the true brotherhood of man under the fatherhood 
of God." 
</P>
<P>
I knew about Bahai because one of its major houses of worship is in suburban 
Chicago, where I once lived. I didn't know that its membership now numbers more 
than 6 million throughout the world and that it has been growing steadily in 
numbers and influence over the past few decades. 
</P>
<P>
Last year, a friend told the DeTallys that a group of 10 young Bahais were 
planning a tour of the Soviet Union and wanted an older couple to accompany 
them. Esther and Bill had just decided that they didn't want to live in 
Southern California any longer and had bought a home in Seattle. But they were 
restless and feeling a need -- as Esther put it -- "to be part of the global 
process instead of just going to the gym." So the idea appealed to them 
instantly. "We looked at our responsibilities and our money," Bill recalled, 
"and we said, 'Let's do it.' " 
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by their 10 youthful associates -- one of whom spoke fluent Russian 
-- the DeTallys spent nine weeks in the Soviet Union under the auspices of the 
Soviet-American Cooperative Society, headquartered in Glenwood Springs, Colo. 
Much of this time was spent in areas seldom before seen by visitors. 
</P>
<P>
One such area was the Siberian city of Ulan Ude, a major missile site where the 
MIG 23 is manufactured. Until last year, it was closed even to other Soviet 
citizens, and residents had to get special permission to leave. 
</P>
<P>
"I spent much of my life," Bill DeTally told me, "working on weapons systems to 
destroy the Soviets. And then one morning on this trip, I find myself sharing a 
wash basin in our hostel with a Soviet engineer on his way to work at the MIG 
factory. And later that day, we were allowed to have lunch in the factory 
cafeteria and pass out our literature on world peace." 
</P>
<P>
Although they were accompanied by an Intourist guide and interpreter, there 
were no restrictions put on the group. In each new town, two of them would 
visit the local media to explain what they were about. The others would set up 
in a public park and play music and talk to anyone who stopped to listen. A 
concert would then be arranged at some local hall that evening. 
</P>
<P>
The concert (the young musicians were all amateurs) would consist of ethnic 
music -- ranging from the Beatles to black African -- followed invariably by 
invitations to members of the group to visit the homes of those in attendance. 
There, talk would often go far into the night. 
</P>
<P>
The one constant in these conversations was the hunger of Soviet citizens for 
information about the United States. "Until four or five years ago," Bill said, 
"the Soviet people were fed nothing but negative propaganda about the U.S. Then 
the doors were opened, and they were permitted an honest look. So in that very 
short span of time, they've gone from one extreme to the other in the way they 
think about us." 
</P>
<P>
Esther enlarged on this. "Most of the people we talked to think that Americans 
have all the answers. We thought it would make them feel better to know about 
the serious domestic problems we have, but they said, 'No, no. We don't want to 
hear that.' All they wanted to hear was that we could offer them absolute 
solutions to their problems." 
</P>
<P>
This hunger was demonstrated over and over, especially in the Ukraine, where, 
Bill said, "there is lots of despair because the people feel that if they don't 
get independence now, they never will." 
</P>
<P>
Except in Moscow -- "which is full of big-city people intent on making a 
living" -- the American visitors found the Soviet people they met "possessing a 
wonderfully generous spirit." (The DeTallys insist on the distinction between 
Soviet and Russian because they were startled and impressed by the diversity 
and independent nature of the dozens of ethnic groups that make up the Soviet 
Union.) 
</P>
<P>
Esther recalled a food shop in a Siberian town named Severo Vaikolsk "in the 
only shopping mall we saw on the whole trip." The DeTallys tried to buy canned 
milk and were turned away with a string of nyets by the storekeeper. They were 
standing there confused when a strange woman approached, handed them a slip of 
paper and disappeared. It was her ration stamp for milk, sugar and tea -- 
enormously valuable in a nation of severe food shortages. "Yet," Esther said, 
"she gave it to us freely. That's how we were treated all over the Soviet 
Union." 
</P>
<P>
When the DeTallys returned to the United States, they spent almost three months 
traveling about this country, talking about their experiences in the Soviet 
Union and thinking about what they wanted to do next. They were, Esther said, 
caught up in a confusing dichotomy of plenty. 
</P>
<P>
"I love the materialism of this country on one level," she said, "but not when 
it chokes the human spirit. People here are so involved in creature comforts, 
and over there they focus on survival." She struggled for a moment for an apt 
metaphor, then said simply: "There's no diet cola in the U.S.S.R." 
</P>
<P>
The DeTallys were haunted by their goodbys in Kiev, where their new friends -- 
and one, especially, with whom they had become very close -- pleaded with them 
to come back. And so they will. 
</P>
<P>
After the holidays, they will sell their house, board their dog with a friend 
and take up residence in the Ukranian city of Dnetrotetrosk for at least a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"We aren't missionaries," Bill said. "The Soviet people aren't into being told 
things right now. They've been told things too long. But the Bahai faith 
believes in independence of thought, so we will be there to share whatever we 
can. We represent people who project hope -- and they need that badly right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
He paused a moment, then concluded: "We're only burning physical bridges behind 
us, not emotional ones. We love this country."

GROWTH HORMONE LINKED TO AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NYU SCHOOL OF MEDICINE, AP Newsfeatures 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Research suggests that treatment with human growth hormone may reverse some of 
the effects that aging has on the body. 
</P>
<P>
Injecting a genetically engineered version of the natural body hormone led to 
an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in body fat in a group of men ranging 
in age from 61 to 81 years old. 
</P>
<P>
However, the results are preliminary, and the long-term effects of human growth 
hormone have yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
"What is exciting is the possibility of using growth hormone on a short-term 
basis to assist recovery from illness, injury and surgery in older people," 
said Dr. Jir-Shiong Tsai, a specialist in geriatric medicine at New York 
University Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
"Having more muscle strength in these situations could be highly beneficial," 
Tsai observed. "We are conducting clinical trials to test this theory." 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone loses muscle and gains fat with age," he explained. A decline in 
human growth hormone may be one reason why fat gathers and muscles wither as 
people grow older. 
</P>
<P>
"At this point, people should not be calling their physicians to ask if they 
should be taking growth hormone," Tsai said. "But the future looks very 
promising." 
</P>
<P>
Growth hormone is produced by the pituitary gland during sleep. As it 
circulates through the body, it stimulates the production of a protein that 
spurs tissue growth and helps maintain organ health. 
</P>
<P>
Over time, at least one-third of the population stops producing any useful 
amount of the hormone, Tsai said. 
</P>
<P>
In the study, healthy older men found to be deficient in that protein were 
given injections of synthetic human growth hormone. After six months, the men 
had significantly increased muscle mass and skin thickness, and decreased 
accumulations of body fat.

NEIGHBORHOOD PROFILE: CENTRAL EL TORO: CLIPBOARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For many long-term residents of Orange County, a drive through central El Toro 
brings back many fond memories of family outings and picnics in the nearby 
Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the place we stopped for cold drinks and candy before heading up to 
Modjeska Canyon on Sunday afternoons," said Sharon Rhodes, who recently moved 
to El Toro from Garden Grove. "That was in the '50s." 
</P>
<P>
The neighborhood was very rural then; not many people lived here. But that's 
hardly the case now. In fact, this area has been the center of some of Orange 
County's most ferocious growth during the last 10 years. Since 1980, there has 
been a 166% increase in the population and an almost 200% growth in the number 
of households. It's hard to believe that as recently as 1970, fewer than a 
thousand people lived here. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the growth and construction of several large housing and condominium 
developments throughout the late 1960s and 1970s, the neighborhood has not 
completely lost its country atmosphere. Greenbelts shaded by eucalyptus trees 
wind throughout, providing pathways and trails between the houses. Many of the 
residences look like mountain cabins and are bordered by wood and stone fences. 
The area is rustic, with a touch of elegance. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro High School is located here, along with Serrano Intermediate and two 
elementary schools. In the mornings and afternoons, the streets and sidewalks 
are crowded with cars and children walking, skating and cycling home from 
school. 
</P>
<P>
Barbara Smith, principal of Serrano Intermediate, said the wooded area 
surrounding the school gives it a secluded, quiet atmosphere conducive to 
learning. "The kids are very active, of course, but the surroundings here are 
very pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
Serrano Intermediate was recently awarded a $40,000 California Technology 
Grant, which was used to install laser discs and computers in the science 
classrooms. "We are participating in a statewide program designed to reduce the 
dropout rate. So we decided to make our teaching methods more active, trying 
new ways to engage the students instead of having them just sit and listen," 
she said. "We've even started on a robotics program." 
</P>
<P>
Every year, the school receives more and more students of various ethnicities 
who need help learning English. "We videotape the child speaking in his native 
language, and later on we tape them speaking English. It's very encouraging for 
new students to see how others have progressed," she said. 
</P>
<P>
There are two parks in Central El Toro: Ranchwood Park, which has a playground 
designed for toddlers, and Lake Forest Park, which includes a small wilderness 
area. 
</P>
<P>
El Toro is an unincorporated area that receives services from the county. But 
efforts to incorporate are under way, and early next year this neighborhood 
could become the center of Orange County's newest city.

SELECTED OCC STUDENTS WILL SET SAIL FOR THE SOUTH SEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Many boaters dream of sailing to some exotic South Seas island, but few ever 
make it. If your New Year's list includes a resolution to fulfill such a wish, 
1991 could be your lucky year. 
</P>
<P>
That's when Orange Coast College will offer its first Polynesian cruising 
adventure -- a 93-day, 8,500-mile voyage that will take about 50 students to 
the Marquesas Islands, Tuamotu, Tahiti and Bora Bora. 
</P>
<P>
Sound exciting? 
</P>
<P>
If so, you had better turn in your application now. 
</P>
<P>
Although the boat does not sail until May, the application process began Dec. 1 
and continues until Feb. 1. Already, 70 persons have signed up for the unusual 
sailing course. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a lot of demand for this trip," says Brad Avery, director of OCC's 
sailing program. "And it is not on a first-come, first-served basis. We are 
going to try to put together a pool of applicants and assess their skills by 
going sailing with them. That way we can put together the best group possible 
for the trip." 
</P>
<P>
Many of the applicants are alumni of other OCC sailing classes, including past 
trips aboard the Alaska Eagle, which has also sailed with students to Alaska 
and Hawaii. The boat, donated to OCC in 1982, has sailed more than 50,000 miles 
with students aboard, including seven sail training cruises to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
"But this is a first for us," says Avery, who has served as skipper on various 
legs of the Alaska Eagle's past journeys. "We wanted to go three years ago, but 
the Coast Guard wanted us to make a few more trips to Hawaii first." 
</P>
<P>
Now with a track record that includes eight years of cruising adventures, the 
Alaska Eagle has received Coast Guard approval to make the South Seas voyage. 
</P>
<P>
"This is our first international voyage and, unlike our previous trips to 
Hawaii and Alaska, this is more of an adventure for us and for our students," 
Avery says. "We are going to be in the Southern Hemisphere and in another 
country. It involves passports and visas. And the boat is going to be quite a 
ways from home. We view this as a big step and a step toward an even greater 
cruising future for the program." 
</P>
<P>
The Polynesian cruise will begin May 11 when the 65-foot Alaska Eagle sets sail 
with a crew of 10 on the first leg of its voyage. The 2,600-mile 
trans-equatorial passage from Newport Beach to Hiva Oa, Marquesas, will take 14 
to 16 days. 
</P>
<P>
After making landfall and clearing customs into Polynesia, the boat will spend 
a week exploring and sailing around the islands of Fatu Hiva, Ua Pou and Nuku 
Hiva. The leg will end in Talohae Bay, Nuku Hiva. From there, students from 
that first leg will return by air to California. 
</P>
<P>
On the second leg of the trip, a new group of 10 students will join the Alaska 
Eagle in Talohae Bay. From there, the boat will depart on a 500-mile, three-day 
sail to the Tuamotu Archipelago. Crew members will spend some time exploring 
the area before sailing on to Moorea and Papeete, Tahiti. 
</P>
<P>
From Tahiti, that group of students will return to Orange County while another 
group joins the boat for a cruise of the Society Islands. Leg 3 will include 11 
days of sailing, but each night will be spent at anchor. On Leg 4, the Alaska 
Eagle will return from Bora Bora to Hawaii, a journey of about 14 to 16 days. 
And on Leg 5, the final leg, the boat will return from Hawaii to Newport Beach, 
arriving sometime in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
Planning the trip has been a challenge, says Avery, who will serve as skipper 
for Legs 1 and 2. "Just handling the airline reservations has been interesting. 
There is only one flight a week into the Marquesas, and you can't miss it," he 
says. "We have people planning their vacations around this, and it is important 
that we be at the places we are supposed to be, when we are supposed to be 
there." 
</P>
<P>
Cost for the cruise varies from $1,295 to $1,695 depending upon the leg. Cruise 
fees include food, but do not include air fares, which can cost another $400 to 
$1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Applications for the sailing adventure may be obtained by calling the Orange 
Coast College Sailing Center at (714) 645-9412. 
</P>
<P>
The Alaska Eagle is now at the sailing center docks where the boat is being 
outfitted for the cruise. "We are spending a lot more time getting the boat 
ready," Avery says, "because the boat is going to be away from home for a long 
time, and it will be difficult to get parts and supplies." 
</P>
<P>
Avery believes that the Polynesian cruise is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity 
for many sailors. "They will be getting the adventure of their lives," he says. 
"And the people who are applying for this trip realize that. They realize that 
this may not come their way again -- unless they have the money to buy their 
own boat and go themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Armchair Adventures -- If you would like to experience the thrill of a sailing 
adventure without going to sea, Orange Coast College has something for you too. 
</P>
<P>
The 1991 Sailing Adventure Lecture Series will get under way at OCC on Jan. 11. 
For 16 years, the popular series, under the direction of Walt Gleckler, has 
been bringing world-class sailors to the county to talk about their voyages. 
</P>
<P>
This year's four-part program will begin with Kellogg and Diana Fleming, who 
are now nearing the end of their circumnavigation aboard a 42-foot ketch. 
Cruising stops for the Flemings have included Cyprus, Turkey, Greece, Italy, 
France, Spain, Gibraltar and Portugal. 
</P>
<P>
Appearing on Jan. 18 will be Russ Nilson and Cynthia D'Vincent, who have 
traveled 200,000 miles in a 90-foot brigantine studying whales. On Jan. 25, 
Montreal-born sailor, actor, poet and filmmaker Yves Gelinas will screen his 
100-minute award-winning film about his single-handed voyage aboard his 30-foot 
sailboat. 
</P>
<P>
The program will end Feb. 1 with a presentation by Mugs and Marcia Davock, who 
completed a seven-year circumnavigation aboard a 41-foot Rhodes sloop. 
</P>
<P>
All four programs will begin at 8 p.m. in the Robert B. Moore Theatre on the 
OCC campus. Tickets are $27 in advance for the entire series or $31 at the 
door. Individual tickets are $7.50 in advance or $9 at the door. For 
information, call (714) 432-5880. 
</P>
<P>
Boating Classes -- The U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary will offer a series of 
boating classes beginning Jan. 7 at the Huntington Harbour Yacht Club, 3821 
Warner Ave. The nine-week series of classes will meet each Monday from 7 to 
9:30 p.m. Cost is $17 per person. For information, call (714) 642-5540.

SHOTGUN INJURES BOY; OWNER HELD

<P>
The manager of a Canoga Park apartment building was in jail this morning after 
he accidentally fired a sawed-off shotgun and the pellets struck an 11-year-old 
boy, causing minor injuries, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
Kevin Kellogg, 24, was arrested on suspicion of possessing an illegal firearm, 
a felony, and was being held at the West Valley Division jail in lieu of $5,000 
bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The boy was taken to UCLA Medical Center in Westwood shortly after the 
shooting, which occurred at 8:30 p.m. Thursday. He was in satisfactory 
condition after being treated for minor pellet wounds to the left side of his 
body, Lt. George Rock said. The victim's name was not released by police. 
</P>
<P>
Police said Kellogg was carrying the gun while "patrolling" in a courtyard area 
of the complex in the 21600 block of Saticoy Street. "He somehow slipped and 
fell, and it went off," Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the pellets apparently ricocheted off the pavement before hitting 
the boy. It was unclear how far away the victim was when he was struck. The 
incident is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg will not be charged with injuring the boy because investigators said 
they believe the shooting was accidental. But altering a shotgun by shortening 
its barrel makes the weapon illegal, Rock said. 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg's reasons for patrolling the complex were unknown. "That location 
doesn't seem to be a terribly bad area," Rock said.

Reacting to a shooting incident outside a rap concert, Anaheim Mayor Fred 
Hunter said this morning that he will ask police to investigate past incidents 
at the Celebrity Theater and may ask the city to revoke the theater's liquor 
license. 
</P>
<P>
"If they can't provide proper security for this place, then perhaps they need 
to go elsewhere," Hunter said, referring to the managers of the Celebrity 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
Security at the theater was criticized by Hunter and some of the rap performers 
who appeared Thursday night after a concert-goer was shot and wounded while 
waiting in line outside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
"We had gone through all kinds of security, but we've never seen anything as 
poorly organized as this," said James Ice, head of security for rap performer 
Ice Cube, shortly after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
Anaheim police were continuing this morning to try to identify the gunman and 
the motive behind the shooting. Investigators confirmed witness accounts that a 
melee inside the theater during a performance by rapper Too Short was unrelated 
to the shooting outside the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Owners and managers of the Celebrity Theater could not be reached for comment.

Vice President Dan Quayle canceled a second round of golf today at the 
all-white Cypress Point golf club, saying he didn't know the club had been the 
object of criticism when he played there Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle's participation in the round on Thursday at the course, which has been 
barred from a national tournament because of its exclusive membership policy, 
was criticized by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a great concern about the vice president of the United States playing 
at Cypress Point and not being aware of the sensitivity of the issue that 
revolves around it," Monterey County Supervisor Sam Karas said. 
</P>
<P>
"I find it interesting that this Administration is so careful not to violate 
any of the policies of Saudi Arabia regarding the American flag and religion, 
and yet seems to ignore a local significant issue," Karas said. 
</P>
<P>
Cypress Point Club became embroiled in controversy in September, when the 
Professional Golfers Assn. ruled it out of the 1991 AT&amp;T Pebble Beach 
National Pro-Am because of its all-white membership. 
</P>
<P>
Quayle shot a 78 on the par-72 course Thursday. Secret Service guards kept 
reporters seeking to question Quayle off the private grounds. 
</P>
<P>
Two Cypress Point Club members who are prominent officials in the Bush 
Administration -- Secretary of the Air Force Donald B. Rice and Ebersole 
Gaines, U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas -- were golfing with Quayle, who had 
planned to play there two days. The fourth member of the group was Phil Edlund 
of Paradise Valley, Ariz.

India, which has difficulty feeding and caring for its own millions, today 
joined the growing list of nations sending relief aid to the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency said a special Indian Air Force flight carrying 
24 tons of medicines and food landed at Moscow's Sheremetyevo Airport today in 
what will be the first of a series of aid flights. 
</P>
<P>
In all, at least 24 nations, including Israel and Sri Lanka, have sent help to 
the Soviet Union in a relief effort that is snowballing. 
</P>
<P>
Although Moscow's mayor and deputy mayor and officials in other cities have 
said there is no danger of famine, the aid keeps arriving. "The Soviet Union 
has received more than 17,000 tons of medicines, medical equipment and food," 
Soviet Deputy Health Minister Alexander Tsarengorodtsev said.

A state law providing for a four-year sentence for first-time crack users and 
probation for first-time users of powdered cocaine is racially biased -- and 
thus unconstitutional, a judge has ruled. 
</P>
<P>
Hennepin County District Judge Pamela Alexander ruled Thursday that state 
sentencing guidelines are flawed, saying there is no logical reason people 
convicted for possession of crack should be treated any differently from those 
convicted of possessing any other form of cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
Assistant Hennepin County Atty. Chuck Sweetland said that if the ruling is 
upheld, "it is going to make it impossible to prosecute the vast majority of 
urban crack cases." 
</P>
<P>
Attorneys for five suspects who challenged the crack law said 92% of people 
arrested on charges of possession of crack in 1988 were black, while 85% of 
people arrested on charges of possessing powdered cocaine were white.

MOSCOW BLOCKS TV REPORT ON SHEVARDNADZE

<P>
Broadcasting officials today canceled a television program about the 
resignation of Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze. 
</P>
<P>
Alexander Lyubimov, presenter of the popular weekly Vzglyad (View), said the 
cancellation of today's edition was especially troubling at a time when the 
country is taking a conservative turn. 
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze, an architect of reform under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, 
resigned last week saying the Soviet Union was heading toward dictatorship. He 
denounced his critics as "reactionary." 
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Vid, the company that produces Vzglyad, said a statement 
would be read before the program's usual broadcast time to explain why it had 
been canceled. 
</P>
<P>
"In essence, the announcement will say the program was canceled by the 
leadership of the State Committee for Radio and Television because of . . . a 
difference in opinion over events of the past year," she told Reuters by 
telephone. 
</P>
<P>
" . . . A difference between the leadership and the authors (of the program)." 
</P>
<P>
The daily Moskovsky Komsomolets said that Leonid Kravchenko, head of the 
committee, had told Vzglyad journalists they should resign if their story of 
the resignation differed from Shevardnadze's explanation to Parliament.

2 ESCAPED SOUTH KOREAN PRISONERS KILL THEMSELVES DURING STANDOFF

Two escaped South Korean prisoners killed themselves with a revolver today 
rather than surrender to police approaching their lakeside hide-out in 
helicopters and rubber boats. 
</P>
<P>
The shootings ended a 36-hour chase for three convicted murderers who broke out 
of their jail early Thursday by sawing through bars in their cell, police said. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police were mobilized for the manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
One escapee was caught near the rural lake outside the provincial city of 
Taejon. When police found him, he surrendered peacefully and asked for food, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
The other two -- Park Bong Sun, 30, and Shin Kwang Jae, 21 -- crossed the lake 
aboard a stolen boat but were trapped by a dozen sharpshooters on the shore. 
Civilians, including news photographers, witnessed the dramatic lakeside 
standoff. 
</P>
<P>
The two rejected repeated calls to surrender, with Park holding the revolver to 
his head and threatening to shoot himself. As police approached in helicopters 
and rubber boats, Park fired a bullet into his head. 
</P>
<P>
Shin then took the gun and fired a bullet into his chest. He died on the way to 
a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
The revolver had been stolen from a police officer earlier today, when the 
escapees, armed with a knife, had been stopped for questioning at a bus 
terminal in Taejon, 100 miles south of Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
A police officer was stabbed in the neck and seriously wounded during that 
confrontation.

2 CARRIERS AMONG 17 SHIPS ON WAY TO GULF

Tearful family members lined piers in a cold breeze and drizzle today as about 
16,000 sailors and Marines began their journey to the gulf to beef up Operation 
Desert Shield forces. 
</P>
<P>
The deployments of 17 ships from East Coast ports, including eight from the 
huge Norfolk Naval Base, involved a rare same-day departure for two aircraft 
carriers, the America and the Theodore Roosevelt. 
</P>
<P>
Several dozen relatives and friends watched as the destroyer Caron pulled out. 
</P>
<P>
Joseph Leyes, whose son, Louis, is an ensign aboard the Caron, said he felt a 
mixture of emotions: "Sad, excited, supportive, frightened. They're going to go 
out there; they're going to do a job; they're going to come back." 
</P>
<P>
Donna Beckum, whose husband, Larry, also is a Caron crew member, said her main 
concern was "just how long they're going to be gone." 
</P>
<P>
The Roosevelt and America will join three other carriers -- the Kennedy, the 
Saratoga and the Ranger -- already operating in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
The deployment of such a large number of U.S. warships to one part of the world 
is unprecedented since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
Capt. Charles S. Abbot, commanding officer of the Roosevelt, said his crew was 
prepared, though not eager, to leave home so soon after the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
Still, Christmas was bittersweet for those shipping out and their families. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm happy he was here for Christmas, but I'm upset he's leaving and not 
knowing when he's coming back," said Carmen Kubala, whose husband, Dan, is an 
electrician aboard the America. 
</P>
<P>
Navy officials said the carriers will take about two weeks to get to their 
destination.

Shiseido Co., Japan's leading cosmetics maker, said today its Australian and

that one Australian researcher linked to skin cancer. 
</P>
<P>
A Shiseido spokesman said, however, that urocanic acid has been used worldwide 
for a long time and has been approved as safe by Japan, the United States and 
many other governments. 
</P>
<P>
He said Shiseido does not plan to recall the products elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said an Australian government advisory on Dec. 18 urged a recall 
and a gradual suspension of use of the acid, an ultraviolet absorbing material.

More than 226,000 new private businesses were registered in eastern Germany in 
the first 10 months of this year, officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
Klaus Solveen, head of the Economic Ministry's eastern German office in Berlin, 
said the creation of new businesses accelerated after East and West Germany 
merged their economies on July 1 as a prelude to political union on Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
A total of 226,652 businesses were registered by Oct. 31, more than a quarter 
of them in the depressed industrial state of Saxony, Solveen told the German 
press agency ADN. 
</P>
<P>
About 113,000 of the new businesses were restaurants and retail outlets, while 
33,000 were involved in handicrafts and 2,000 were related to tourism. 
</P>
<P>
Revival of small- and medium-sized business in formerly Communist eastern 
Germany is viewed as crucial to turning around an economy floundering from mass 
shutdowns of state-owned industry.

The Chinese government said today it will double city bus fares and raise by 20 
times the cost of tickets for the Great Wall in the new year -- the first hikes 
in 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
Beijing residents reacted to the increases with dismay and voiced fears of a 
resurgence in 1991 of inflation, which soared to 18% in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Bus and trolley fares will double from the equivalent of one U.S. cent to two 
cents and underground fares will rise from six cents to 10 cents. 
</P>
<P>
The huge increases were the first since fares and park entrance fees were 
introduced 40 years ago, the state-run New China News Agency quoted a city 
official as saying. 
</P>
<P>
Admission tickets to most parks and tourist sites, including the Great Wall and 
the Summer Palace will go up from two cents to 40 cents. Between 30,000 and 
40,000 people visit the Summer Palace each day.

The official said France's move is in accordance with a decision taken by the

RAMS RETAIN ROBINSON AS COACH; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: TEAM ANNOUNCES HE WILL CONTINUE NEXT SEASON IN LAST YEAR OF CONTRACT 
AND RECEIVE AN EXTENSION.

<P>
John Robinson, rumored on his way out as head coach of the Rams during the 
team's worst season since 1982, will return to the team next year, it was 
announced today. 
</P>
<P>
Rams owner Georgia Frontiere announced that Robinson, in his eighth year as the 
team's coach, will "continue as head coach of the Rams next year and into the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Robinson, the winningest coach in the team's history since succeeding the late 
Ray Malavasi after the Rams went 2-7 during the strike-interrupted 1982 season, 
is in the fourth year of a five-year contract. Frontiere said an extension of 
the contract will be negotiated during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
Robinson's teams are 76-60, but the Rams are just 5-10 this year entering its 
regular-season finale Monday night at New Orleans. The Rams failed to qualify 
for the playoffs for only the second time in Robinson's eight years as their 
head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Only last year, the Rams went 11-5 and won playoff games on the road over 
Philadelphia and the New York Giants before losing to eventual Super Bowl 
champion San Francisco in the NFC Championship Game, 30-3. 
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing but the deepest respect for John's abilities, and I'm certain 
that he is just as committed as I am to bringing our fans a championship team 
next year," Frontiere said in a press release. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to announcing that Robinson will return as head coach, Frontiere 
said in the press release that provisions will be made for him to have greater 
input in the NFL draft and in the selection and signing of Plan B free agents. 
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Robinson's first year as head coach, the Rams were 9-7 and qualified 
for the playoffs as a wild-card team. They were 10-6 in 1984 and made it as a 
wild-card again.

First Harvey, now Horace. Joe Dumars is taking nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars, of the Detroit Pistons, was fined today by the NBA for the second time 
this month for fighting one of the Grant twins. 
</P>
<P>
Dumars was assessed a $1,000 fine for starting a fight with Horace Grant on 
Christmas Day in Chicago, and Horace, of the Bulls, was fined $2,500 for 
retaliating. 
</P>
<P>
On Dec. 1, Dumars retaliated when Harvey Grant of the Washington Bullets 
started a fight in Landover, Md. Two days later, the NBA got Dumars for $1,000, 
Harvey for $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fines stemmed from an incident with 3:05 left in the game, 
when Dumars threw an elbow into Horace Grant's stomach. Grant returned fire 
with a right hand to Dumars' stomach. Grant was ejected, Dumars was not. 
</P>
<P>
The NBA also fined Dumars' teammate, Isiah Thomas, for a fight in another game. 
Thomas got a $1,500 penalty for punching rookie Trevor Wilson of the Atlanta 
Hawks during Detroit's 113-87 victory on Dec. 21.

JONATHAN BLOCH IN BIDDING FOR NBA ROCKETS

Jonathan Bloch, son of the former owner of the Phoenix Suns, has confirmed he 
is negotiating to purchase the NBA Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
"You are talking to somebody who conceivably could do the deal," Bloch told the 
Houston Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm the one who is having conversations with the Rockets, not my father." 
</P>
<P>
Bloch's father Richard Bloch sold the Suns in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Rockets owner Charlie Thomas' secretary said Thomas declined comment. Thomas 
said before the season started that he was not actively seeking a sale but he 
would listen to attractive offers, reportedly of $90 million to $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas purchased the Rockets in 1982 for $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
Jonathan Bloch, an officer for the Suns when his father owned the team, told 
KTRK-TV, Houston on Thursday night that Bloch was negotiating the sale. 
</P>
<P>
"I would be the managing partner and my father would be involved on a limited 
basis," Bloch told the Houston Post. "I've been talking with Charlie but there 
is no firm deal at this moment. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't say how close or how far apart we are. We're talking about a very 
large transaction in a very difficult business. It's obviously very 
complicated." 
</P>
<P>
Thomas is the seventh owner of the Rockets. He bought the team June 15, 1982, 
and the Rockets reached the National Basketball Assn. finals in 1986, 
accompanied by a long string of sellout crowds in the 16,016-seat Summit. 
</P>
<P>
The Rockets had 16 sellouts in 41 home dates last season and they've had two in 
14 games this season. Unless the Rockets get more seating they are projected to 
be in the bottom third of the league in attendance capacity in the next two to 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
Any franchise sale would have to be approved by the NBA Board of Governors.

Jefferson-Morgan High School ended a 74-game, 3 1/2-season losing streak in 
basketball Thursday night by upsetting Mapletown 71 to 69 in a holiday 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
A wrestling power whose success hasn't extended to basketball, Jefferson-Morgan 
won on the court for the first time since Feb. 3, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm glad for the kids more than anything else," Jefferson-Morgan Coach Jim 
Romanus said. "It was tough for them to keep playing when all they kept hearing 
about was this streak." 
</P>
<P>
Romanus, who coached the Rockets through the entire slump, added: "It's hard to 
believe. Sometimes I think it's a dream and I'm going to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
Mapletown entered the game with a 5-2 record.

Pete Weber was suspended from the Pro Bowlers Tour for six months today, but 
will continue to compete pending appeal. 
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Joe Antenora said the suspension, for violating the PBA's 
standards of conduct, was automatic because Weber was on probation. 
</P>
<P>
Antenora would not disclose the alleged violation "because the matter is under 
appeal." 
</P>
<P>
Weber told the Professional Bowlers Assn. he will appeal, and the matter could 
be unresolved until late spring. 
</P>
<P>
Antenora said Weber was on probation for three conduct code violations during a 
12-month period.

a doubles victory today as Czechoslovakia defeated Germany, 2-1, to advance to 
the quarterfinals of the Hopman Cup. 
</P>
<P>
Isabel Cueto beat Rajchrtova, 2-6, 6-2, 6-4, to give Germany a 1-0 lead, but 
Korda defeated Steeb, 6-3, 2-6, 6-2, and combined with Rachjrtova to beat Steeb 
and Cueto, 6-1, 6-3, in mixed doubles. 
</P>

Cueto was too steady for the error-prone Rajchrtova in the opening singles, but 
Korda then out-served and out-volleyed Steeb in a hard-fought match. 
</P>

Salman Rushdie, under an Iranian death sentence for alleged blasphemy against 
Islam in his novel "The Satanic Verses," today explained his recent embracing 
of the Muslim faith. 
</P>
<P>
"I am certainly not a good Muslim, but I am able now to say that I am a 
Muslim," Rushdie wrote in a column published today in the New York Times and 
the Times of London. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie, a British citizen born in India, said he came from a Muslim family 
background but wasn't reared as a believer. 
</P>
<P>
"However . . . I have been engaging more and more with religious belief . . . 
and religion for me has always meant Islam," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie rejected Muslim calls for withdrawal of "The Satanic Verses," however. 
" 'The Satanic Verses' is a novel that many of its readers have found to be of 
value. I cannot betray them," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old author has been in hiding since the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini 
ordered that he be killed in February, 1989. Khomeini died June 3, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Rushdie on Monday pledged not to publish the novel in paperback or in languages 
other than English. He also said the utterances of the novel's characters did 
not represent his own views. But Iran's current spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali 
Khamenei, said Wednesday that the earlier decree that Rushdie must die is 
irreversible.

Donald Trump may be having a cash crisis, but the high-profile developer has 
nothing but bravura when it comes to talking about his finances. 
</P>
<P>
Trump's Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, N.J., is facing a proposed 
reorganization since he missed a $47.3-million interest payment on $675-million 
worth of high-yield junk bonds used to finance the gaming house. 
</P>
<P>
The bondholders had threatened to push Trump into bankruptcy proceedings and 
seize control of the casino before a compromise was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, none of this seems to trouble Trump. 
</P>
<P>
"Mark my words," he said in an interview published in Thursday's Wall Street 
Journal. "In 12 months," he said, "I will be worth more than I was two years 
ago."

DEBRA WINGER SUMS UP HER LIFE: 'NO REGRETS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Debra Winger is pondering life. Her left arm is raised to eye level, the elbow 
perched on the opposite wrist, and her cigarette slants upward as it rests 
between her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
The actress spent six months in the Sahara filming "The Sheltering Sky," and in 
some ways she hasn't quite returned. "It's a joke, isn't it?" she said. 
</P>
<P>
But her career still matters, more than ever. Winger works full time -- 
reading, thinking, talking -- looking for self-knowledge that can be collected 
and stored for future roles and looking for roles that can bring her 
self-knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
"My life affects my work, and work affects my life," Winger explained. "I work 
more and more toward homogenization. I don't want to be the sort of person who 
puts on a hat by the door and goes out. You have to find a way to intermingle 
the two. You have to find a way to show your growth in your work." 
</P>
<P>
"The Sheltering Sky," based on Paul Bowles' acclaimed 1949 novel, stars Winger 
and John Malkovich as a wealthy American couple who travel through the desert 
in Africa, discovering unpleasant truths about their marriage and themselves. 
Bernardo Bertolucci directed, his first film since the Academy Award-winning 
"The Last Emperor." 
</P>
<P>
She summed up the past in two words: "No regrets." Not about fights with 
directors and fellow actors, not about her brief marriage to actor Timothy 
Hutton, not about turning down the part in "Broadcast News" that made a star of 
Holly Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
Two other words momentarily upset her, make her gag and cough as if someone had 
put a fly in her coffee. The words are "turbulent brilliance," and they were 
used by Shirley MacLaine on Academy Awards night in 1984 to assess her "Terms 
of Endearment" co-star. 
</P>
<P>
"I have a T-shirt that Shirley gave me the day after the Academy Awards when 
she felt the necessity to call me turbulent and brilliant instead of just 
brilliant," said Winger, who lost to MacLaine for best actress. 
</P>
<P>
"She heard I was a little rattled, and the T-shirt said, 'Turbulent Means 
Brilliant.' Oh, give me a break! If it needs an explanation, don't say it." 
</P>
<P>
On sand or on pavement, it's been a bumpy ride for Winger, born in Cleveland in 
1955. Her decision to become an actress was turbulent, a matter quite literally 
of life and death. 
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve, 1973, she was thrown from a moving truck and nearly died 
from a cerebral hemorrhage. Winger was studying sociology and criminology at 
the time, but quickly lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to act before, but I was still under the pull of my parents and sort 
of under the middle-class work ethic. It was a hobby, you know. You don't 
actually do that for a living. 
</P>
<P>
"But when somebody experiences death, near death, you realize you're all alone 
at the end. And I said I can't do something another day that I won't be 
completely fulfilled in." 
</P>
<P>
Winger admits to problems with drugs and temperament in the past, but insists 
they didn't keep her from working, that she knew which experiences were best to 
draw on. 
</P>
<P>
An old story about John Barrymore draws out her bubbly, staccato laugh. The 
actor was in London, supposedly to star in "Hamlet," but spending most of his 
time chasing women. 
</P>
<P>
Hours before opening night, he succeeded. His dress rehearsal consisted of 
Scotch, wine and a hospitable duchess. He arrived half an hour before curtain 
time and passed out in his dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
"I was the first American to play Hamlet on a London stage, and I was also the 
first drunk to play it on any stage in the world," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
The lights made him dizzy. He had to lean on another actor to keep from falling 
down. He would exit in the middle of a scene and vomit in the wings. He 
performed his soliloquy sprawled in a chair. 
</P>
<P>
"But I missed no words of Will Shakespeare's, and I missed no cue," Barrymore 
boasted. The critics raved, never had turbulence and brilliance worked so well 
together. Art had triumphed over life, or was it the other way around? 
</P>
<P>
Winger said: "For every actor, there's that Adrenalin that gets going once the 
curtain goes up or once the camera starts rolling. Only for me, the process 
begins a little sooner. 
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes I feel like the town idiot. People can be saying terrible things 
about me, people can hate me, but I don't care, I just want to keep doing what 
I'm doing."
