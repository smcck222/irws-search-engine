A KAFKA FOR SOUTH AFRICA; 
</P>
<P>
ADVANCE, RETREAT BY RICHARD RIVE (ST. MARTIN'S PRESS: $16.96; 131 PP.) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Johnson, Johnson's forthcoming novel is Middle Passage. He is the 
author of Being and Race: Black Writing Since 1970. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the fictional world of Richard Rive, a black South African writer, the 
social evil of apartheid appears in the guise of a banality so extreme it can 
be expressed only in the form of darkly comic, Kafkaesque parables. For 
example, in his story "The Man From the Board," a teacher named Isaac Jacobs is 
called upon by "a dumpy little man wearing a khaki safari suit." This droll 
creature, Mr. Johannes Bredenkamp, arrives to inform Jacobs that since his 
racial classification is "colored," he must leave the white area where he is 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Bredenkamp bears no whiff of hostility toward Jacobs. A petty bureaucrat 
with "brilliantined hair," he is recognizable in any country and at any time as 
a funny little government functionary far more interested in Jacob's choice in 
television sets ("Stick to a Sony. The colour is OK"), and his philosophy of 
life than in racism; and he lavishly compliments the teacher on his life style: 
"Lucky you, being a bachelor and spending most of your time just lecturing and 
reading." 
</P>
<P>
Grotesques like Bredenkamp fill the 12 stories collected in "Advance, Retreat," 
their presence reminding us, as in the fiction of Flannery O'Conner, that evil 
leads inevitably to social monstrosities, to a madness we have come to accept 
as the status quo. We laugh nervously, as Rive wishes, at a society so 
blatantly premised on racial prejudice, but the humor holds within itself the 
horror of our own absurdity. 
</P>
<P>
A case in point is "Drive-In," which illustrates how the stupidity of 
segregation turns even South African liberals into insensitive louts. Here, 
Rive's narrator and nameless protagonist, a black writer, is trying to escape 
from a boring "informal get-together, a social occasion of would-be writers and 
weekend poets." Before he can flee, a white teacher named Jenny, who is 
"ostentatiously progressive and liberal," insists on giving him a ride. 
"Everything about you people fascinates me," she says. 
</P>
<P>
Although the narrator does everything he can to shock her into seeing her own 
bigotry, she is unflappable and spirits him off to a segregated drive-in where 
she insists they be served. The manager, "a huge Greek who for the first time 
in his life realized that he was a white man when he emigrated to South 
Africa," rings for the police. Jenny digs in, oblivious to the gnawing panic of 
her black passenger, insisting, "If you have no guts, I'm prepared to call his 
bluff." Finally, the narrator convinces her to leave, but not before undergoing 
the humiliation of confessing to a woman blinded by her own zeal and 
indifference to his situation, "Yes, I have no guts." 
</P>
<P>
The courage required to oppose apartheid is lost on the Jennys of South Africa, 
according to Rive, but not to Karlie, a simple black man who discovers the real 
meaning of resistance in "The Bench," easily the most memorable tale in this 
volume and one that takes us behind the newspaper headlines into the heart of 
civil disobedience. Karlie would be the last man to think of rebellion. 
However, one day he hears a speaker proclaim, "It is up to every one of us to 
challenge the right of any law which willfully condemns any person to an 
inferior status." To Karlie, "the man on the platform seemed to be rolling out 
a new religion, which said that he, Karlie, had certain rights, and his 
children would have certain rights. What sort of rights? Like a white man for 
instance?" 
</P>
<P>
Although frightened by the thought that he "was as good as any other man," 
Karlie moves almost hypnotically to a train station where "There seemed a 
cocoon around each person. Each has his own world. Each moving in a narrow 
pattern of his own manufacture." He locates a bench with the legend WHITES ONLY 
and sits; he waits for the arrival of a policeman, who strikes him down, then 
handcuffs him. The scene, we know, has been played countless times, and one 
might think Karlie's victory is Pyrrhic -- all the white observers see is 
another black arrested -- but Karlie has achieved "if not a victory over them, 
then one over himself," over his fear and the propaganda of inferiority. 
</P>
<P>
Critics may accuse Rive of writing not stories but sketches where his meaning 
is thinly veiled. This is true of "No Room at Solitaire," a Christmas story set 
in a South African inn where a black Joseph and pregnant Mary are turned away 
by the owner, who realizes his error too late. 
</P>
<P>
But even with its flaws, "Advance, Retreat" is a collection to be highly 
recommended to anyone who wishes to experience the texture and feel of black 
South African lives before they are rendered in the language of politics. 
</P>
<P>
And it must be read for another reason: Rive's talent is clearly world-class. 
These stories have appeared in more than 12 languages and in more than 22 
countries, but "Advance, Retreat" is the last we shall see of this wizardry. 
Richard Rive, after a writing career of 30 years, was murdered in his home near 
Cape Town on June 6 of this year.

The Big Street (TNT Sunday at 9:05 a.m.): Lucille Ball's favorite among her 
dramatic films is this endearing 1942 Damon Runyon tale in which Ball's 
ill-fated, flashy, gold-digging Manhattan singer is adored by Henry Fonda's 
naive busboy. This is the "Midnight Cowboy" of a more innocent era. (1:55)

Sounder (Channel 7 Sunday at 1 p.m.): Martin Ritt's stirring 1972 film stars 
Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield as a resilient backwoods Louisiana couple 
struggling to raise a family as sharecroppers in the depths of the Depression. 
(2:00)

best performances of his career.

Thunderball (ABC Sunday at 8:30 p.m.), the fourth James Bond film, finds Agent 
007 (Sean Connery) trying to learn who hijacked two nuclear bombs in a NATO 
plane and is ransoming them for a million pounds. It's a handsome production 
with a suitably spectacular finish. 
</P>
<P>
Of the two Liberace TV movies shown in 1988, Liberace: Behind the Music (CBS 
Sunday at 9 p.m.) is by far the better of the two, although Victor Garber 
doesn't resemble the late entertainer nearly as closely as Andrew Robinson does 
in the authorized version. Nevertheless, Garber is a splendid actor, and Gavin 
Lambert's script captures well the complexities of Liberace's life as an 
active, though closeted, homosexual who succumbs to AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
Goddess of Love (NBC Sunday at 9 p.m.), in which Vanna White made her 1988 TV 
movie debut as Venus, is so awful it must be seen to be disbelieved. 
</P>
<P>
Barbra Streisand and Ryan O'Neal had a hit with "What's Up, Doc?" but struck 
out with another attempt at '30s-style screwball comedy in The Main Event 
(Channel 13 Monday at 8 p.m.). Streisand plays a perfume tycoon forced to take 
over the career of recalcitrant boxer O'Neal. 
</P>
<P>
Lassiter (Channel 7 Monday at 9:30 p.m.) may be lightweight, but this elegant 
and entertaining 1984 fantasy adventure served Tom Selleck well. He's a classy 
jewel thief, enamored of nightclub dancer Jane Seymour. Set in London in 1939, 
the film's plot revolves around millions of dollars in uncut diamonds stolen by 
the Nazis when they seized Czechoslovakia. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond the Poseidon Adventure (Channel 13 Tuesday at 8 p.m.), the 1979 sequel 
to the 1972 original, is a fairly routine and tedious business which finds 
fortune hunters Sally Field, Michael Caine and Karl Malden searching for 
salvage in the capsized ocean liner, the Poseidon. 
</P>
<P>
Children of a Lesser God (CBS Tuesday at 8:30 p.m.) is a classic love story 
with a difference -- the heroine (Marlee Maitlin) has been deaf her entire 
life. When she and a teacher of speech to the hard of hearing (William Hurt) 
fall in love, we're able to see in their struggle to communicate an 
intensification of the challenges of any two people trying to make a life 
together in today's world. What makes the film come so poignantly alive is its 
understanding of the psychology of close relationships between the hard of 
hearing and "normal" people. 
</P>
<P>
As a comedy-Western, The Gambler (Channel 11 Wednesday at 8 p.m.) was nothing 
special, but star Kenny Rogers' fans made this 1980 TV movie, based on his hit 
song of the same name, one of the most popular TV movies ever, spawning a 
two-part 1983 sequel, which airs Thursday and Friday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Go to Sleep (Channel 13 Wednesday at 8 p.m.), a 1982 TV movie written by 
Ned Wynn and directed by Richard Lang, is a potent spine-tingler dealing with a 
family stricken with guilt over the tragic death of its eldest daughter. Dennis 
Weaver, Valerie Harper and Ruth Gordon star. 
</P>
<P>
Robert Benton's 1987 Nadine (Channel 5 Thursday at 8 p.m.) is an endearing, 
souffle-light little throwaway about lovers, larceny and losers, but mostly it 
is a deeply felt tribute to Texas womanhood, exemplified by Kim Basinger, who 
soon finds herself on the run with her hapless husband (Jeff Bridges) after she 
witnesses a murder. 
</P>
<P>
Oliver Stone's 1986 Salvador (Channel 13 Thursday at 8 p.m., again on Saturday 
at 8 p.m.) is intensely alive; it broils, snaps and explodes with energy as 
sleazy outlaw combat photojournalist Richard Boyle (James Woods, never better) 
and his bellicose disc-jockey buddy (Jim Belushi) flee to El Salvador and wind 
up the anti-heroes in a corrosive, perceptive political thriller. 
</P>
<P>
John Boorman's 1981 Excalibur (Channel 13 Friday at 8 p.m.) is the most 
pictorially stunning of all the movie adaptations of the Arthurian legends, and 
is most memorable for its sensuality and Nicol Williamson's eerie Merlin. 
</P>
<P>
Without George Burns, Just You and Me, Kid (Channel 5 Saturday at 6 p.m.) would 
play like a foolish sitcom, but for him it's a cakewalk. He's a retired, 
content vaudevillian who crosses paths with Brooke Shields, on the run from a 
nasty drug pusher. 
</P>
<P>
All About Eve (Channel 28 Saturday at 10 p.m.) is the film classic that seems 
to reflect more of the real Bette Davis than any of her other pictures, playing 
a gutsy, tempestuous, and vulnerable Broadway star defending herself against 
Anne Baxter's conniving Eve Harrington.

BETTER LIVING THROUGH ALCHEMY; 
</P>
<P>
THE CHYMICAL WEDDING BY LINDSAY CLARKE (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $19.95; 536 PP., 
0-394-57937-2) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Merle Rubin, Rubin is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The alchemist was the forerunner of the modern chemist, just as the astrologer 
was the forerunner of the modern astronomer. When one considers the growing 
influence of astrology in recent decades -- from its role in the '60s 
counterculture and subsequent infiltration of conventional chatter ("What's 
your sign?") to its dramatic elevation to high office in the person of the 
Reagan White House astrologer -- should it be so surprising to come across a 
novel that seriously advocates the idea of better living through alchemy? 
</P>
<P>
Looking backwards through the keen lenses of modern natural science, we 
visualize the medieval alchemist as a confused figure: a charlatan or true 
believer who tried to convert "baser" (i.e., less precious) metals into gold. 
We think of alchemy as a pseudo-science claiming to change the physical world 
through spiritual, or "magic," power. Orthodox Christian contemporaries of 
alchemists looked askance at this abuse of spiritual power for materialistic 
ends. Rationalists doubted the claims of alchemists; the pious half-believed 
and disapproved. 
</P>
<P>
In "The Chymical Wedding," the second novel of British writer Lindsay Clarke 
(and the winner of the Whitbread Award for best novel of the year), alchemy is 
presented as a spiritual process with spiritual goals -- or, rather, as a quest 
for the fusion of material and spiritual worlds, endowing matter with spirit 
and making the spiritual world as "real" as the physical one. Historically, 
this is not illegitimate, for alchemy, cabalism, Gnosticism, witchcraft and 
Neoplatonism can be viewed as distinct yet intermingling streams in the lore of 
the occult. 
</P>
<P>
The occult often is mystical, but not always. Ideas declared heretical by the 
early Christian orthodoxy (including some that we might now judge 
scientifically sound) were sometimes kept alive as part of "occult" -- 
literally, "hidden" -- tradition. Followers of the occult had a knack for being 
rationalistic when the surrounding religious orthodoxy demanded faith alone, 
but for looking irrational compared with the modern scientific method, whose 
eventual triumph dealt a second devastating blow to these arcane forms of 
learning. Yet, in times of stress, when we are prone to doubt ourselves and our 
orthodoxies, the appeal of the occult grows stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Clarke, needless to say, is not concerned with specific formulas to change lead 
into gold, but rather with the change of outlook that might replace the 
mentality that (in Wordsworth's phrase) "murder(s) to dissect" with a more 
holistic one. Alchemy in "The Chymical Wedding" represents a quasi-Romantic, 
vaguely Blakean marriage of opposites: dark and light, male and female, 
spiritual and physical. In keeping with the mythologizing tendencies of such an 
enterprise, Clarke assembles two sets of characters to play out a pair of 
parallel stories -- one unfolding in the 1980s, the other in the 1820s -- which 
manage to intersect in mysterious ways. 
</P>
<P>
The suggestively named Alex Darken is a young poet in retreat from a failed 
marriage. Taking refuge at his publisher's cottage in a small English village 
in Norfolk, Alex encounters Edward Nesbit, an irascible old poet whose early 
verses Alex once admired extravagantly, and a young American named Laura, who 
seems to be attached to him. Edward mocks and entices Alex by reading him his 
fortune from tarot cards. Soon, despite his continuing skepticism, Alex is 
drawn into Edward and Laura's obsession with alchemy and into their personal 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
Edward and Laura have been researching the story of another old man and young 
woman -- in this case, a father and daughter -- Henry and Louisa Agnew, 
alchemical adepts who lived in the village back in the 1820s. The two 
narratives are interwoven. While Henry labors in vain on his lifelong project 
of a poem setting forth the mysteries of alchemy, his daughter Louisa is 
writing a prose prolegomenon to his work, which she calls "An Open Invitation 
to the Chymical Wedding." Precisely what became of her work is a mystery that 
the modern-day "researchers" are trying to solve. 
</P>
<P>
Just as Edward and Laura are joined by Alex Darken, so Henry and Louisa become 
involved with a newcomer to their neighborhood, a troubled young clergyman, 
Edwin Frere (another deliberately suggestive name, meaning brother in French). 
Like Alex, Edwin has problems in his marriage. The relationship that flowers 
between the passionate yet inhibited clergyman and the wise and beautiful 
Louisa finds a parallel and a contrast in the one that develops between Alex 
and Laura. Indeed, in some ways, the latter-day relationship is a "working out" 
of the earlier one. 
</P>
<P>
For my taste, the 19th-Century story line is the stronger of the two, both 
because it is innately more dramatic and because it captures that 
quintessentially 19th-Century blend of evangelical piety and scarcely submerged 
erotic passion. It is a set-piece, but a well-polished, nicely mounted one. The 
modern subplot has the typical late 20th-Century mix of broken marriages, 
spontaneous love-making, and dread of nuclear war (attending a Campaign for 
Nuclear Disarmament meeting, Alex wonders if alchemy can help us out of the 
pass to which we've brought ourselves). But this mix is a little muddled and 
pallid. 
</P>
<P>
We sense we're in trouble early on when cantankerous old Edward warns Alex that 
"poetry is not enough." 
</P>
<P>
By the end, it seems that alchemy is not enough either -- or, as the novel 
disingenuously implies, that it's too much for flawed human beings to handle 
(in which case, it is no more of a "solution" than the science, philosophy, 
religion, politics or poetry it set out to replace). 
</P>
<P>
Clarke's lush storytelling leads us through a circular maze located somewhere 
between the realms of possible enchantment and passable entertainment. But by 
the time we've emerged from the foliage and looked back on the labyrinth, it 
already seems a little too stagy to take to heart.

Sources tell us that Andrei Konchalovsky will return to his Soviet homeland 
this summer, to write and direct "The Inner Circle," a drama about corruption 
within the Stalinist regime that presumably could not have been filmed there 
pre-glasnost. (Calls to the director's representatives were not returned at 
press time). 
</P>
<P>
Konchalovsky, who left the Soviet Union on a visa in 1980, will shoot in 
Moscow. Tom Hulce is expected to star. 
</P>
<P>
The script, co-written by Anatoly Usov, finds Ivan, an uneducated film 
projectionist, thrust into a position of power when he's assigned to screen 
movies for Stalin. Ivan, who ultimately joins the KGB, finds himself a witness 
to the paranoia, corruption and brutality of the ruling government. 
</P>
<P>
Along with returning Konchalovsky to familiar physical turf, the project 
returns him to the psychological studies for which he's known ("Maria's 
Lovers," "Shy People"). 
</P>
<P>
He also helmed the critically hailed "Runaway Train" (1985), as well as the 
critically assailed "Tango &amp; Cash," just out, which he exited before 
shooting wrapped. Albert Magnoli ("Purple Rain") completed the filming, but 
Konchalovsky's the credited director. Pat H. Broeske

Morris the Cat is almost 13 -- nearly George Burns' age, in cat years -- and 
he's going strong: a 1990 Morris the Cat calendar, public appearances, 
continuing 9-Lives TV spots. Plus that new one for Kitten Dinners, in which 
Morris makes a finicky comment about some talkative kitties. Said a 9-Lives 
spokeswoman: "He's still very much in the media limelight." 
</P>
<P>
Morris travels three months a year to 25 cities, drawing crowds at state fairs, 
military bases, cat shows. etc. He did a segment of "Lifestyles of the Rich and 
Famous" last year, was featured on "Entertainment Tonight" and appeared on 
regional talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
The original Morris died in 1978 at age 19. Both were found at animal shelters, 
and Morris II hasn't forgotten his roots. He's the official spokescat for 
"Adopt-a-Cat Month" each June, sponsored by 9-Lives and the American Humane 
Assn. He also helps publicize Cat Health Month each September, which 9-Lives 
sponsors with the American Veterinary Medical Assn. 
</P>
<P>
His screen persona is no act, insisted the spokeswoman, who claimed to know 
Morris personally.

CASTING OF ASIANS

<P>
Regarding Calendar's article about the road show of "The King and I" (Nov. 26): 
</P>
<P>
As an advocacy organization interested in the balanced and realistic portrayals 
of Asian/Pacific Americans in the media, we want to voice our dissent and 
concern over the casting choices for the show. To use no Asians as principals 
is unjust and anachronistic, especially when "The King and I" is a musical so 
obviously based on Asian themes. 
</P>
<P>
Granted Rudolf Nureyev is one of the greatest dancers of the 20th Century, with 
the power and presence to portray the King magnificently. However, there are 
many talented Asian-American performers who could have been cast for the 
principal leads. 
</P>
<P>
In this era of heightened social awareness, it is as unacceptable to use actors 
playing in "yellowface" as it is to have Caucasians play in "blackface." The 
producer of the show, Manny Kladitis, should have been more sensitive to the 
Asian-American audience, and also should have considered the fact that he has 
insulted the intelligence of the general public.

After reading Dr. Joseph Herman's Dec. 10 letter criticizing Barbara Marcus' 
desire to restrict children under the age of 5 from movie theaters, I strongly 
regret that he wasn't sitting next to me last Saturday evening as a 3-year-old 
boy in front of me talked throughout the entire funeral scene of "Steel 
Magnolias." Then he, too, could have had the climax scene of the film 
completely ruined. 
</P>
<P>
As an early-childhood education teacher, I know the limits of young children. I 
think it's cruel for parents to expect their toddlers to sit quietly and still 
for two hours at a movie that holds no interest for them. 
</P>
<P>
If we cannot restrict toddlers from movies, maybe the theaters could take a 
lesson from restaurants ("smoking" and "non-smoking") and offer seating in 
"talking" and "non-talking" sections.

NEVER GIVE UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Regarding Joselito Paule's Dec. 17 letter, I must say that if the writer gives 
up his dream of becoming a film maker based on one sentence by Steven 
Spielberg, then he never believed in it to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
Mr. Paule states that he "can't afford (the) risk" of trying to make films of 
"personal satisfaction" in a competitive industry. But I ask Joselito Paule if 
he can afford the risk of knowing that he sold out on his dream, that he didn't 
even try. This is the stuff of mid-life crises. 
</P>
<P>
I share the same dream, an undying passion to tell a good story, and no band of 
cutthroat businessmen is going to keep me from it. 
</P>
<P>
I am a steadfast idealist who believes that the best life a person can live is 
the one closest to his or her dreams. And I believe Steven Spielberg would 
agree with this.

ABOUT THE TOP MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While including on their Top 10 lists for the 1980s voyeuristic sleaze ("Blue 
Velvet"), hip amateurism ("Do the Right Thing"), childish trivia ("Raiders of 
the Lost Ark") and pretentious pseudo art ("Raging Bull"), the Times' movie 
reviewers revealed the prerequisites for their job: short memories and bad 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
Conspicuous by their absence were such clearly superior works as "Breaker 
Morant," "The Flight of the Eagle," "The Official Story," "When Father Was Away 
on Business," "A Cry in the Dark," "Melvin and Howard" and "Diner." 
</P>
<P>
Even Peter Rainer included on his list "E.T." -- which may have been fun, but 
let's not raise calculating box-office movie candy to the level of films with 
genuine substance, originality and lasting merit.

ABOUT THE TOP MOVIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If your selection of the best movies is any indication, the 1980s was a 
depressing decade indeed. 
</P>
<P>
The best films in the 1980s emphasized brutal, cold-blooded violence and sexual 
perversion ("Blue Velvet," "Once Upon a Time in America," "Prizzi's Honor"), 
marital turmoil ("War of the Roses," "Shoot the Moon"), drug abuse ("Drugstore 
Cowboy"), child degeneration ("Pixote" -- about a 10-year-old pimp, drug user 
and murderer) and even offered a bleak look at the future ("Brazil," "The Road 
Warrior" and "Blade Runner"). 
</P>
<P>
Hopefully, movies in the 1990s will be a little more uplifting.

HOW ABOUT THE WORD? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Was it not the ultimate comment on the '80s that your compendium of the major 
taste makers of the decade did not include a single novelist, poet or literary 
critic? 
</P>
<P>
I was hoping you would find room among the studio executives, performance 
artists and restaurateurs to mention someone who still resorts to the written 
word as a method of communication. Can we say of American literature in the 
'80s, then, that there simply was none? Or, even more disparagingly, that it 
had less impact on our culture than Jay Leno or the Chinese Chicken Salad?

It's a sad state of musical accomplishment when composer Philip Glass is 
singled out as a "taste maker." If America has nothing better to adulate, we'd 
best hang it up and leave music leadership to saner countries.

CROSSING NETWORK IS SIMPLY A STOCK TRADING APPARATUS, NOT A SECRET WALL STREET 
SOCIETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with interest Martin Mayer's Viewpoint ("Is the SEC Surrendering Its 
Birthright?" Nov. 26) but there are some points of detail that should be 
corrected. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer implies that the Crossing Network operates largely "behind the scenes," 
unknown even to Wall Street professionals. The Crossing Network has been 
actively marketed and widely publicized during the three years since its 
introduction and is well known to a broad spectrum of the securities industry. 
</P>
<P>
Mayer also states that Crossing Network trades "are not reported anywhere." All 
Crossing Network trades are reported daily to the National Assn. of Securities 
Dealers. Users of the Crossing Network may also request that Instinet report 
their Crossing Network transactions to the International Stock Exchange in 
London. 
</P>
<P>
Anonymity, in the context of the Crossing Network, means only that a user does 
not know the identity of the contra side of a trade. The benefit to the user is 
that because all orders are entered and traded anonymously at closing prices, 
there is no market impact. No market impact combined with low commissions 
results in better performance for Crossing Network participants. 
</P>
<P>
The Crossing Network does not attempt to shut out broker/dealers in favor of 
institutional investors. Several of the largest broker/dealers are regular 
Crossing Network participants. Instinet and its Crossing Network provide a 
neutral, level playing field for all professional equity traders using its 
electronic access systems. 
</P>
<P>
Instinet, a registered broker/dealer, is a member of the NASD, the American 
Stock Exchange, the London International Stock Exchange and other regional 
stock exchanges, and is subject to the same regulations and surveillance that 
all members are.

NEW SOFTWARE SHOULD WORK ON OLD MACHINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How much longer can the general public afford to keep up with computer vendors' 
newest hardware and operating systems? In "Big-Name Manufacturers Give OS/2 a 
Boost" (Computer File, Nov. 23), there is a perfect paradox between technology 
for the minority and workability for the majority. 
</P>
<P>
I applaud those vendors who are working together to produce "new programs" more 
compatible and with better integration in comparison to older programs. 
However, the masses will be content with their older machines and software 
unless the price is affordable. It is time for those vendors who are making the 
"newer" software easier to also make the "newer" software workable on the older 
machines for the majority of us.

A FINANCIAL PLANNER CAN BE A GOLD MINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I feel that the article about financial planners ("Financial Planner, Broker 
Offer Different Services," Dec. 3) in your special section deprecates financial 
planners by showing a negative and distrustful attitude without giving any 
mention of the many worthwhile benefits of utilizing such a professional. 
</P>
<P>
As the owner of a retail showroom, I have found the complexity of coordinating 
my attorney, accountant, investments, tax planning, personal health insurance 
and group health benefits an almost impossible task without the guidance of my 
financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
My financial planner implements the various financial products he recommends 
and sells insurance policies. My time is much more effective while utilizing a 
financial planner. 
</P>
<P>
Good financial planners should be well paid; they are literally worth their 
weight in gold.

WHAT WOULD FOOD BE WITHOUT CHEMICALS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
I read with enormous interest the news in Bruce Horovitz's column on marketing 
("Firm Exercises its Social Consciousness," Dec. 5) that a new "socially 
conscious fast-food company" is introducing "chemical-free food" to the 
marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
Since protein, fats, sugars, nucleic acids, salt and water are all chemicals 
that make up the food that we humans and our pets eat, I think you can 
understand why I am intrigued and excited by the revolutionary idea of 
"chemical-free food." I do hope that you plan to run a feature on this 
scientific breakthrough as soon as possible.

ERMA BOMBECK: MAKING HORSE SENSE OF NEW YEAR'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERMA BOMBECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Did you ever wonder why the symbol of New Year's is a kid wearing a diaper and 
a top hat and carrying a horn? 
</P>
<P>
You don't have to run over me with a truck. I've already associated the diaper 
with change. But why the party hats and horns? 
</P>
<P>
To be honest, I haven't lost a lot of sleep over this, but you have to admit, 
it sends out some mixed messages. Do we all strip and go naked into the new 
year? What happens to the old guy digging around with a scythe with his 
bathrobe open? Why would I follow anyone into a new year who in 365 days ages 
110 years? I'd just as soon march behind the Energizer batteries on TV that 
bang through people's lives as if they have a passkey. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe little New Year is supposed to exude innocence, freshness and optimism . 
. . like Bobby in the shower on "Dallas." He's born again to tackle another 
season, another year, another decade. 
</P>
<P>
I looked at the symbol the other day and got a flash. Wouldn't it be reasonable 
that this urchin in a diaper is a reminder to shed some of the baggage of last 
year and go into the new one in our birthday suits? 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we shouldn't have any pockets holding names of old adversaries to whom we 
are not speaking -- and can't even remember why. No hair shirts of self-pity 
that we've worn for too many years without cleansing. No glasses that allow us 
to see all of our differences but none of our likenesses. No designer 
accessories, such as self-inflicted pain and guilt, and out-of-control ambition 
and perfection. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we shouldn't have any shoes that have walked in the same ruts of old 
ideas and stubborn resistance to change for too many years. No luggage to kick 
along holding years of yellowed hatred and crumbling prejudices toward people 
no longer alive. No neckties or scarfs to choke out laughter, joy and words of 
forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe we should be like a baby who has just entered the world ready to 
celebrate life on its terms. Maybe this child does represent a newness, yet 
another chance to grow, to develop, to learn anew. Maybe we all need a new 
wardrobe: short enough to be interesting, yet long enough to cover the subject. 
</P>
<P>
I ran this theory by my husband the other day. He said, "Hey, New Year's is 
just another day when all the horses are a year older. It's no big deal." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe. Actually, it would account for the top hat and the noisemaker.

PIGS IN A BLANKET

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When last we looked in on Kayla Mull of Norco, in June, she was one of only a 
few Americans breeding miniature Chinese potbellied pigs -- the newest pet 
rage. 
</P>
<P>
After starting several years ago with three little pigs, Mull has reached the 
point where she placed 40 this year with eager families through her Creatures 
of Comfort Co. "At present, my husband, Marden , and I have 16 piglets roaming 
the house. Some of them sleep on the waterbed with us. They have names such as 
Frankenswine, Pigsqueak and Swine Romance." 
</P>
<P>
Mull, a 38-year-old microbiologist, said that since spring she has received 
purchase requests from such faraway places as Norway, Japan and Belgium. The 
cost runs from $1,500 for a barrow (castrated male) to $10,000 for a pregnant 
sow. The minis grow up to 18 inches, weigh from 40 to 90 pounds and have a life 
expectancy of up to 20 years. "They are easily housebroken, and will sleep on 
the bed with you like a cat or dog," Mull said. 
</P>
<P>
During 1989, Mull said, her new owners of pigs included a Harvard college 
student who keeps one in his third-floor apartment and a man who takes his 
along on motorcycle camping trips. 
</P>
<P>
"And there was a situation where one belonged to a couple who had been living 
together. They broke up, but she insisted upon and got the pig." DAVID LARSEN

A SPIRITUAL CAUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Last July, Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the Dalai Lama of Tibet, spent three 
weeks in Los Angeles, conducting an initiation ritual to advanced Buddhist 
meditation, generally delighting audiences with his warmth and humor, and 
speaking about the cause of his people. 
</P>
<P>
(Tibet was invaded and occupied by China in 1950 and since has been partially 
absorbed by that country, with another part occupied and declared an autonomous 
region by China. As the spiritual and temporal leader of Tibet, the Dalai Lama 
has been living in exile in India since 1959.) 
</P>
<P>
In December, despite the strong protests of the Chinese government, the Dalai 
Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo. He traveled with a small 
entourage of his supporters and staff to Norway, where he was honored for his 
nonviolent crusade for human rights, freedom and peace -- for Tibet and for the 
planet. 
</P>
<P>
Michelle Bohana, human rights director for the International Campaign for 
Tibet, was here with the Dalai Lama's delegation last July -- the subject of a 
July 20 story in View -- and was one of the few who attended the ceremonies in 
Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
It is too early to judge the effects of his receiving the prize, Bohana said 
from her office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
"It elevates His Holiness, quite rightfully, to the status of a world 
statesperson, and that has to have an effect on Beijing or they wouldn't have 
responded with so much vehemence. The immediate effect in Lhasa (capital of 
Tibet) is an increase in repressive tactics. There have been more arrests. But 
in the long term, it's going to be positive. I personally think it's the best 
thing to have happened to Tibet in 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
Just as the Dalai Lama visibly charmed and moved so many people in Los Angeles, 
so did he affect the Norwegians and the gathering assembled there for the award 
ceremonies, she said: 
</P>
<P>
"The Norwegians treated His Holiness with a respect that bordered on 
reverence." 
</P>
<P>
It was, in short, a great celebration. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, in Buddhism there is a teaching about rejoicing," Bohana said. "When 
something wonderful happens, you're allowed the opportunity to rejoice. We 
don't have cause to celebrate very often," she said of people who have been 
involved in the Tibetan cause. "After 40 years we were able to rejoice, and we 
came away inspired and renewed." KATHLEEN HENDRIX

<TEXT>
<P>
Activist Felicia Marcus has put her environmental law degree to work full-time. 
"I've gone into mega-management," she announced from the City Hall office she 
occupies as one of Los Angeles' five commissioners of public works. They 
oversee a five-bureau, 5,000-employee department that is responsible for the 
city's sewers, waste treatment facilities, garbage, street maintenance and 
other housekeeping activities. 
</P>
<P>
"Our work ranges from the nitty-gritty to the sublime," said Marcus, who was 
profiled in View June 16, just before she was named to the post by Mayor Tom 
Bradley. Before then, Marcus, 33, was director of litigation for Public Counsel 
(a public-interest law firm) and spent her free time as a volunteer activist on 
behalf of environmental reform. As a founder of Heal the Bay, she led a 
successful movement to stop the city of Los Angeles from dumping sewage sludge 
into the ocean. Now she has an inside seat, and the luxury of focusing all her 
energies on environmental issues. "I can be a lot more effective here than 
being on the outside part-time," she says of her $65,000-a-year job. "People 
are incredibly supportive of the things I suggest." 
</P>
<P>
With Los Angeles at a "major crossroads" in terms of environmental issues, 
Marcus thinks that decisions being made today are pivotal. 
</P>
<P>
"We need to look at Los Angeles as a whole," she said. For example, "it strikes 
me as incredibly odd that we have this huge problem with water supply and we 
have a huge problem with solid waste disposal. About a third of the solid waste 
disposal is yard clippings, and that doesn't make sense, because that's all 
stuff that has to be watered. 
</P>
<P>
"That's one of the results of not having long-range planning." CONNIE KOENENN

When he was 36, author Richard Yates wrote a novel, "Revolutionary Road," which 
was lavishly lauded by playwright Tennessee Williams. In the decades since 
then, Yates has consistently produced books that have been critically praised 
but commercially unrewarding. His themes have never been upbeat, and he has 
supported himself and his family largely on fees from teaching creative writing 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
When he was interviewed last July, Yates was teaching at USC while working on a 
novel based on material drawn from his stint as a speechwriter for Atty. Gen. 
Robert Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
The book's title -- "Uncertain Times" -- sums up the writer's financial status 
over much of his working life. Ironically, it is "Uncertain Times" that has 
brought Yates the measure of economic security he has long sought to support 
his writing. 
</P>
<P>
Contracted to another publisher for the book, Yates was unexpectedly offered a 
two-book contract with his long-time supporter, Seymour Lawrence, who gave him 
the advance to write his first novel nearly 30 years ago. "It was a lucky 
break," allows Yates, who is winding up his teaching obligations at USC this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
For the new year, Yates looks forward to devoting all his time to his book. 
"Uncertain Times" is scheduled for publication in the spring, and perhaps for 
Yates, times will be uncertain no more. ELIZABETH VENANT

BIRTH OF A NEW CAREER 
</P>

Judy Ryder, a Woodland Hills mother who was profiled in View's Consumers column 
on July 5 after inventing a baby product inspired by the birth of her daughter, 
Jessica, has become a full-time consultant to other entrepreneurs who want to 
market their inventions. 
</P>
<P>
Ryder, 29, spent 2 1/2 years trying to get her new product -- Little Shirt 
Anchors, which keep a baby's shirt tucked in -- to the marketplace. So she 
started a baby products catalogue and sold her invention, and those of other 
parents, through that. 
</P>
<P>
But in July, A-Plus Products, a Santa Monica marketing firm, bought the rights 
and now sells the Little Shirt Anchors, with Ryder receiving an advance and 
royalties for each shirt fastener sold. In the meantime, Ryder got more than 
500 calls from parents wanting advice on how to market their own product ideas. 
</P>
<P>
"They would say, 'How do you do this?' and I knew where they were coming from, 
because you're helpless and don't know where to start," Ryder said. 
</P>
<P>
For several months, Ryder shared her information for free, spending hours a day 
on the phone giving advice and letting her catalogue business slide. Then, in 
November, a Glenview, Ill. couple, Phyllis and Carroll Coulam, offered to buy 
her Ryder Products catalogue business. Ryder sold out and became a full-time 
business consultant. 
</P>
<P>
She decided she would charge by the hour for what she did for people. "I called 
consultants, every kind from music to ones who help set up home computers. The 
cheapest I found was $75 an hour, the most expensive, $800 an hour. So I 
decided to charge $50 an hour. If somebody called and talked to me for 15 
minutes and never called again, I still won't charge anything. Too many people 
out there are getting ripped off." LYNN SIMROSS

WAITING FOR OPEN DOOR

<P>
When a Times reporter phoned Doris Bartlett to pursue the story of her 
husband's May 5 death, she was reluctant to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
Mired in grief, rage and fear, she was not sure how to cope with or get past 
her emotions. Her husband had died -- after 39 married years and before the 
joys of retirement -- while awaiting an insurance company's approval of his 
request for a pacemaker. 
</P>
<P>
But Bartlett didn't decide to talk about her husband's death "until I talked 
with my minister and my husband's doctors and they, too, insisted I share my 
story." 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at her decision, she now says the story, which ran Aug. 15, 
changed the course of her grief and perhaps her life. 
</P>
<P>
From the day the article appeared, she began receiving friendship calls and 
letters from acquaintances who hadn't known her husband had died. And from 
people who looked her up in the phone book to tell her their similar 
experiences. And from one friend who said he had a sleeping disorder and needed 
oxygen therapy in his home, but that his insurance wouldn't provide it. "He 
told me he was afraid he'd die in the middle of the night. Then he read the 
article and got the courage to call (his carrier) and complain again. The man 
there had just read the article, too, and he said, 'Don't worry, within two 
hours you will have the oxygen you need and we'll keep it coming to you,' " 
Bartlett says. 
</P>
<P>
Thus, Bartlett believes her candor has helped save at least one life. And then, 
she says, the television stations started to call for interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Bartlett says she became an activist almost without realizing it. But she 
decided not to sue her insurance company because "I am 67 years old and it 
would be in the courts for five to seven years, and I do not want to spend my 
remaining time that way. There is no amount of money that will bring my husband 
back." 
</P>
<P>
Now, she says, she is "waiting for God to open another door. I have to find 
something to do that would be more beneficial than sitting in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
"And just this week," she adds, "I decided I've become a whole person again. 
I'm back to being me. I feel I can do almost anything now, if I could manage to 
get through all of this." BETTIJANE LEVINE

ON AGING: A NEW FREEDOM AT FIFTYSOMETHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THE UCLA/USC LONG-TERM CARE GERONTOLOGY CENTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Question: When my co-workers surprised me recently on my 50th birthday, I cried 
during the party. Although my colleagues interpreted my tears as a sign of joy, 
to me they were a symbol of a frightening realization: I'm growing older. I 
know I have many good years left, but I can't shake the feeling that I'm racing 
against the clock. Is this common among people in their 50s? 
</P>
<P>
Answer: Yes -- perhaps more so than people age "fiftysomething" care to admit. 
</P>
<P>
"The 50s is a fulcrum decade, a turning point in the aging process during which 
people, more sharply than before, are made to feel their age," sociologist 
David A. Karp writes in a recent issue of the Gerontologist. 
</P>
<P>
A 50th birthday, particularly one marked by a special celebration, can spark 
new awareness of the years gone by. So can a body that tires more easily, the 
death of a friend or the birth of a first grandchild. "Events pile up in the 
50s, making reflection about age particularly likely in this decade," Karp 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
The Boston College professor's findings are based on in-depth interviews with 
72 professional men and women age 50 to 60. Few of the study participants 
described themselves as old. ("I want to continue to call it middle age until 
I'm physically impaired," one person said, echoing a common sentiment.) 
However, many did experience the finiteness of time. As gerontologist Bernice 
Neugarten once noted of middle-age adults, they had begun to view life in terms 
of the "time-left-to-live rather than the time since birth." 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, the heightened sense of mortality in the 50s is mitigated by a 
feeling of new freedom. The participants in Karp's study reported feeling less 
worried about things, more laid back, liberated from major family 
responsibilities and wiser as a result of their accumulated experience. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I am a 79-year-old woman who has always been active. Recently, I enrolled in 
an exercise class for older people and am now experiencing chronic soreness and 
stiffness in both legs. My doctor diagnosed this as osteoarthritis, possibly 
triggered by the exercise. Must I now lead a sedentary life, or may I continue 
to exercise? 
</P>
<P>
A: Exercise is an important part of any plan to manage osteoarthritis, or 
degenerative joint disease. This chronic disease, of unknown cause, involves 
the gradual breakdown of tissues that allow proper joint movement. You 
mentioned a key symptom of the disease: mild aching or soreness of affected 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
Although osteoarthritis can occur in any joint, weight-bearing joints, such as 
the knees, hips and spine, are most commonly affected. 
</P>
<P>
According to the Arthritis Foundation, exercise for osteoarthritis sufferers 
can help maintain flexibility in the affected joints, restore and preserve the 
strength of surrounding muscles, and protect diseased joints from further 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
Appropriate exercises usually involve gentle movements that take the affected 
joints through their full range of motion. The exercise regimen may also 
include isometrics (tightening parts of the body without moving joints) and 
non- or low-impact aerobic activity, such as swimming, which promotes 
cardiovascular fitness. 
</P>
<P>
Before resuming any exercise program, consult your physician or a 
rheumatologist (a physician who specializes in diseases of the connective 
tissue, such as arthritis). Your doctor may refer you to a physical therapist 
to design a personal exercise plan. In addition to exercise, a comprehensive 
plan may include protection for the affected joints, weight control to minimize 
stress on weight-bearing joints, heat and cold treatments, and medication to 
relieve discomfort. 
</P>
<P>
The Arthritis Foundation offers group exercise programs for people with 
arthritis. For further information, contact your local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
Q: I was widowed seven years ago (I'm 58) and am now dating several men. I'm 
enjoying my freedom and am not sure I want to remarry. Is single or married 
life best? 
</P>
<P>
A: There are pros and cons with either choice. Single life and married life 
share similar fulfillments, disappointments, pleasures and problems. When 
people feel frustrated, it's usually because they aren't living the way they 
would like. 
</P>
<P>
You may prefer to keep relationships open-ended because remarriage would mean 
giving up new-found independence. You may not want to support your partner 
financially or in ill health, jeopardize your economic benefits or give up your 
home. 
</P>
<P>
When unmarried respondents with sexual partners were asked in a Consumer's 
Union survey of older adults why they didn't get married, almost half indicated 
they preferred things the way they were. The biggest difference between women 
and men was that 43% of the women -- but only 16% of the men -- said they 
couldn't get married because their sexual partners were already married to 
someone else. 
</P>
<P>
If marriage is your goal, someone who is committed to someone else, emotionally 
unstable or uninterested in a sustained relationship is not for you. 
</P>
<P>
Today's social climate is more permissive. Think about your views on marriage, 
living together and the circumstances under which sexual activity is acceptable 
to you. What's important is making choices with which you feel comfortable.

</P>
<P>
10. Three major fires. 
</P>
<P>
In the past year, the San Gabriel Valley and its residents gained a new city, 
endured a wave of drive-by shootings, saw hopes of landing a professional 
football team fade and engaged in controversies on issues ranging from foreign 
language signs on stores to morbidness in school textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, one of the area's most prominent politicians went on trial on 
corruption charges, city government in Pomona was thrown into turmoil and a 
major environmental battle was fought over the expansion of an Azusa dump. 
</P>
<P>
But the theme that dominated many San Gabriel Valley news stories in 1989 was 
the issue of development versus preservation. That continuing source of 
controversy, often pitting developers against homeowners, was the top news 
story of 1989, in the opinion of editors and reporters in The Times' San 
Gabriel Valley edition. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists won a major victory in Pasadena in March when voters approved 
an initiative limiting growth. Pasadena Residents in Defense of our Environment 
sponsored the initiative, claiming it was needed to ease traffic congestion, 
curb high-rise construction and stop the bulldozing of single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Commerce, Urban League, developers and business interests fought 
it, claiming it would cost the city business and jobs and would reduce the 
availability of low- and moderate-priced housing. Voters approved the 
initiative by a decisive margin. 
</P>
<P>
The measure restricts construction of housing to 250 units a year, not counting 
housing that is deemed affordable. The measure also bans mini-malls and sets a 
yearly limit on construction of major office buildings and other commercial 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
Preservationists also made progress in persuading cities along the foothills to 
tighten restrictions on hillside construction. In Glendora, a private land 
conservancy was established, and the city is planning to ask voters in April 
whether they are willing to be taxed to fund hillside purchases. Other 
proposals would put 1,600 acres in Sierra Madre and 1,200 acres in Claremont 
under public ownership. 
</P>
<P>
Although slow-growth forces made gains last year, they also suffered some 
losses. The Pasadena Board of Directors overrode objections from Pasadena 
Heritage and approved the One Colorado project, a $75-million development at 
the site of a group of historic buildings on Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
The Monterey Park City Council approved plans for a $27-million to $30-million 
renovation of the Atlantic Square Shopping Center, despite complaints about 
traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
The County Board of Supervisors overrode neighborhood opposition to approve the 
La Vina project, a plan to build 272 homes on 220 acres in Altadena. 
</P>
<P>
In West Covina, the City Council approved a $112-million expansion of the 
Fashion Plaza shopping center, a decision that was controversial because of the 
terms of the agreement between the developer and the city redevelopment agency 
and concern about the impact of moving the May Co. from the Eastland Shopping 
Center to Fashion Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
2. Violent crime 
</P>
<P>
Violent crime, including a record number of homicides in Pomona, was the No. 2. 
story in the San Gabriel Valley. Pomona had 36 killings in the first nine 
months of 1989, more than any San Gabriel Valley city had ever recorded in a 
full year. The victims ranged from teen-agers shot on the street to an elderly 
brother and sister beaten in their home. 
</P>
<P>
Police from Pomona to Pasadena reported numerous drive-by shootings, as gangs 
battled each other over the drug trade and tried to avenge previous assaults. 
</P>
<P>
In the Pasadena-Altadena area, one death of a gang member in 1988, police said, 
led to a series of retaliatory gang attacks between the Bloods and the Crips 
that continued into 1989 and took 10 lives. 
</P>
<P>
3. Irwindale, Others Court the Raiders 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale has been unable to complete the $115-million deal made with the 
Raiders two years ago. By the end of the year, the football team seems more 
likely to move to Sacramento, return to Oakland or even stay in Los Angeles in 
a rebuilt Coliseum than move to Irwindale, but city officials have not given up 
hope that the Raiders will someday play their games in a stadium built in a 
gravel pit. 
</P>
<P>
The negotiations have been hampered by a series of changes in the city's 
bargaining team. One of the key negotiators, Fred Lyte, was fired as city 
redevelopment consultant and is suing the city. Another negotiator, public 
relations consultant Xavier Hermosillo, was fired, rehired and fired again. 
</P>
<P>
4. Political Tumult Shakes Up Pomona 
</P>
<P>
No city generated more controversy than Pomona, where the election of Tomas 
Ursua to the council in March created a new alignment that put harsh critics of 
city management in the council majority. The council fired A. J. Wilson as city 
administrator and dismissed Richard Tefank as police chief. Other department 
heads and key officials, including the city attorney and head of the 
redevelopment agency, retired or quit. 
</P>
<P>
A movement to recall Councilman C. L. (Clay) Bryant was begun after the council 
fired Wilson in May. The effort picked up backing from city employee groups 
after the council fired the police chief in October and Bryant was sued by two 
police officers. They sued after he said at a council meeting that one of them 
was under psychiatric care and both were being investigated for sexual 
harassment. 
</P>
<P>
The officers accused Bryant of disclosing confidential information, but Bryant 
claimed he had said nothing that was not a matter of record. Recall petitions 
are being circulated and will be submitted to the city clerk in January. 
</P>
<P>
The effort to oust Bryant was the second major recall campaign in the San 
Gabriel Valley in 1989. In May, San Gabriel Councilman Frank Blaszcak was 
recalled after allegations that included misusing city funds by buying a $2,100 
portable phone and harassing city employees. Blaszcak lost the recall election 
by nine votes. 
</P>
<P>
5. Indictment and Trial of State Sen. Montoya 
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Joseph B. Montoya (D-Whittier), who has represented portions of the 
San Gabriel Valley in Sacramento for 17 years, was indicted on corruption 
charges. His trial, which has recessed until Tuesday, has included testimony 
that Montoya solicited payments for his support of legislation. He is accused 
of extortion, bribery, racketeering and money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
Montoya won election to the La Puente City Council 21 years ago, then advanced 
to the Assembly in 1972 and to the Senate in 1978. Montoya has said he will 
seek reelection next year. Assemblyman Charles M. Calderon (D-Whittier) and 
Assemblywoman Sally Tanner (D-Baldwin Park) have talked about running for his 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
The year ended with a rush of political activity and speculation, prompted not 
only by Montoya's difficulties, but also by the retirement of another veteran 
San Gabriel Valley politician, Sen. William Campbell (R-Hacienda Heights). 
Campbell resigned Dec. 15 to become president of the California Manufacturers 
Assn., a business lobby. 
</P>
<P>
6. The Incorporation of Diamond Bar 
</P>
<P>
The number of cities in the San Gabriel Valley grew to 29 with the 
incorporation of Diamond Bar in March. Voters in the community of 65,000 
favored cityhood by 3 to 1 and elected five City Council members. 
</P>
<P>
As soon as the city was formed, the Diamond Bar council found itself in a suit 
with San Bernardino County over a chain-link fence and wooden barricades that 
were installed across Grand Avenue to keep Chino Hills traffic out of Diamond 
Bar. 
</P>
<P>
After five months of negotiation, Diamond Bar agreed to remove the barrier and 
San Bernardino County agreed to pay $1.2 million for traffic signals and road 
improvements to ease traffic congestion in Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
7. Sign Ordinances Spark Controversies 
</P>
<P>
U.S. District Judge Robert Takasugi ruled in July that a Pomona ordinance 
requiring the use of English characters on business signs was unconstitutional. 
The city had required businesses that use foreign characters in their signs to 
devote half their space to English characters. The judge said the ordinance 
"was clearly an attack by the city of Pomona on its growing Asian community." 
</P>
<P>
The Asian Pacific American Legal Center of Southern California and the American 
Civil Liberties Union used the Pomona ruling to challenge similar ordinances in 
San Gabriel, Arcadia, Rosemead and Temple City. 
</P>
<P>
8. Bid to Increase Azusa Landfill's Size 
</P>
<P>
Browning-Ferris Industries' proposal to quadruple the daily dumping capacity of 
1,500 tons at its Azusa landfill was opposed by local water officials, the 
Metropolitan Water District and groups such as the March of Dimes and the 
Environmental Defense Fund. 
</P>
<P>
Opponents contended that the trash could seep through the bottom of the 
landfill into ground water. Browning-Ferris insisted it could install a system 
to protect ground water and also promised to put up $20 million to clean up the 
area's existing water pollution. 
</P>
<P>
The State Water Resources Control Board approved the expansion in October, but 
opponents have sued to overturn that decision. 
</P>
<P>
9. Hacienda La Puente, Sierra Madre Schools 
</P>
<P>
Parents in the Hacienda La Puente Unified School District battled school 
officials over textbooks the parents said were morbid, macabre and harmful to 
children. The controversy centered on an elementary school reading series, 
titled "Impressions," which is used by hundreds of school districts across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
The series incorporates literature drawn from folklore, mythology and fairy 
tales, and its backers say it stimulates children's imaginations and love for 
reading. The school board voted to withdraw the series and sue the publisher. 
</P>
<P>
In Sierra Madre, some parents led an effort to secede from the Pasadena Unified 
School District, citing gangs, violence and low test scores in the Pasadena 
district. Pasadena school officials opposed the move, arguing that the loss of 
students from mostly white Sierra Madre would complicate efforts to comply with 
federally mandated racial integration. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles County Committee on School District Reorganization has 
recommended against the secession, but the state Board of Education will make 
the final decision. 
</P>
<P>
10. Three Major Fires 
</P>
<P>
A July brush fire destroyed 13 houses and damaged eight others in Hacienda 
Heights. In one December week, half a block of stores burned in downtown Sierra 
Madre and in Pasadena, and an Orange Grove Avenue condominium burned. 
</P>
<P>
Other major stories: 
</P>
<P>
* Continuing battle over the expansion of the Long Beach (710) Freeway through 
South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
* Controversy over aerial spraying of malathion to attack the Medfly. 
</P>
<P>
* New efforts by cities to encourage recycling.

BOWMEN FROM THE OTHER SAN MARINO HIT TARGET: AMITY

SAN MARINO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The keepers of the crossbow came from afar and descended on this community. But 
they came to make friends, not war. 
</P>
<P>
More than 60 experts on the medieval crossbow arrived late Wednesday from the 
Republic of San Marino, a 23-square-mile, landlocked nation surrounded by 
Italy, to spend five days in the town that is its namesake. 
</P>
<P>
The main reason for their first official visit to the United States is to 
appear in Monday's Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
But, while staying as guests at local residences, they are also spreading tales 
of their traditions, which are enjoying a renaissance among crossbow 
enthusiasts in their country. 
</P>
<P>
At ceremonies at City Hall on Thursday, Amedeo Venerucci, vice president of the 
Republic of San Marino's crossbow federation, proudly showed the 
standing-room-only audience a single crossbow. 
</P>
<P>
More than 50 pounds in weight and handmade of steel and wood, it was an 
accurate replica of the medieval weapon used by the likes of William Tell. Its 
walnut stock was carved with a fantasy figure: a boar's head attached to the 
scaly body and tail of a dragon. The feathered arrow looked, as one city worker 
put it, "like it could go through three people in a row. Whooosh!" 
</P>
<P>
During the Middle Ages, Venerucci said, the crossbowmen of San Marino deterred 
potential invaders from attacking the tiny but mountainous republic. As a 
14-year-old in 1956, inspired by such lore, he joined 100 other youngsters and 
two adults in an effort to revive long-dead traditions -- for demonstration 
only. 
</P>
<P>
Onlookers in the packed council chambers Thursday included Tournament of Roses 
President Don Fedde of San Marino, who wore a crossbow lapel pin. After the 
ceremonies, Venerucci and others toured the city police station and viewed an 
assortment of shotguns. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the realization of a dream come true," Venerucci said. "We have 
performed all over Europe. But since the Rose Parade is known worldwide, we now 
will be known around the world." 
</P>
<P>
Venerucci, 47, a financial consultant, said the trip is significant for other 
reasons. Many members of the group are blue-collar workers who otherwise never 
would have had an opportunity to visit America, much less be treated like 
royalty by residents of this decidedly non-blue-collar town. 
</P>
<P>
Said local enthusiast Howard Topp, who has visited the republic as part of an 
official delegation: "It's medieval pageantry, medieval fellowship that goes 
with it. It's not like your typical football game or basketball game. It's 
cultural and it's historic." 
</P>
<P>
About three years ago, former Mayor Lynn Reitnouer and his wife, Winnie, 
started trying to arrange the Rose Parade appearance. But the crossbow group 
didn't meet Tournament of Roses criteria. "They weren't a float, a marching 
band or an equestrian unit," Reitnouer said. 
</P>
<P>
But, after some help from Fedde, the parade's Variance Committee gave its 
approval. The European group will march, nine crossbows in hand, with the 
International House of Pancakes float, which depicts an armored knight on 
horseback. 
</P>
<P>
And at 1:30 p.m. today at San Marino High School, the elaborately costumed 
crossbowmen will stage a free public demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
"The shooting is incredible," said San Marino resident Kenneth Veronda, who on 
behalf of the city has made three trips to the republic and witnessed 
competitions there. "I've seen them split one arrow on top of another."

DEVELOPER JOINS BID TO BLOCK APRIL ELECTION DATE FOR MALIBU CITYHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RON RUSSELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A Malibu developer has joined county officials in asking a judge to dismiss a 
lawsuit by Malibu cityhood backers who want to force the Los Angeles County 
Board of Supervisors to set an April cityhood election in the seaside 
community. 
</P>
<P>
An attorney for the Adamson Companies told Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs 
last week that if Malibu incorporates before the county installs a regional 
sewer system there, it could wreck the firm's plans to develop a $60-million 
seaside hotel. 
</P>
<P>
"We need the sewer system in order to proceed," attorney Thomas K. Houston 
said. "If some future city government should succeed in opposing it, we would 
face the prospect of having to start all over." 
</P>
<P>
Cityhood supporters, many of whom have long regarded the county's sewer plans 
as a recipe for extensive development, have sued the supervisors in a bid to 
force them to set an April 10 election to let voters decide on incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
State Law 
</P>
<P>
The incorporation advocates have accused the supervisors of violating a state 
law that allows them 60 days from when they began hearing the cityhood matter 
to conclude the hearing as a final step before setting an election. Although 
the supervisors began hearing the matter Oct. 19, they voted 4 to 1 last month 
to indefinitely postpone a decision on incorporation until construction permits 
are issued for the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
The lawsuit asks the judge to force the supervisors to finish the hearing, 
which would clear the way for the supervisors to set an election. 
</P>
<P>
Judge Janavs indicated that she may rule on the matter this week. 
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for the Malibu Township Council, one of two pro-cityhood groups filing 
the lawsuit, called the Adamson Companies' intervention on the county's behalf 
"inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
"It's interesting that they've come out of the shadows and made an open 
declaration that they're carrying the ball for development interests in 
Malibu," attorney John B. Murdock said. "But we think it's inappropriate for a 
corporation to attempt to block the setting of an election that affects 
registered voters." 
</P>
<P>
In a related development last week, a Malibu real estate broker took a 
different approach in opposing cityhood backers. A lawyer for John Corrodi 
asked Janavs to prohibit the supervisors from setting an election until there 
are reasonable assurances that the sewer system will be built. 
</P>
<P>
"My client's interest is in seeing that the sewer system goes forward," 
attorney Dan Corey said. "His is not an opposition to cityhood per se." 
</P>
<P>
As proposed, the 20-square-mile city would stretch from Topanga Canyon to Leo 
Carrillo State Beach along Pacific Coast Highway and nearly one mile inland. 
</P>
<P>
In approving a bid by Malibu residents to vote on cityhood, the Local Agency 
Formation Commission in May stipulated that the county be allowed to retain 
control over the sewer system for up to 10 years after incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
However, county officials, fearing that a newly elected Malibu government would 
mount a legal challenge to that provision, want to make sure that a sewer they 
consider adequate is under way before Malibu residents vote on cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
Last month, the state Coastal Commission approved a sewer plan that opponents 
said would result in a sewer system 25% to 40% smaller than what the county had 
insisted upon. But county officials have said it could take a year before the 
commission approved the construction permits. 
</P>
<P>
County Approval 
</P>
<P>
The Adamson Companies received approval from the county and the Coastal 
Commission four years ago to build a three-story luxury hotel on 28 acres in 
the civic center area of Malibu, but the approval was predicated on 
construction of the sewer system. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the commission's scaling back of the county's original sewer plan, the 
firm has said that its hotel plans can still be accommodated by a smaller 
system. 
</P>
<P>
However, under terms of its approval, if the project is not built within five 
years, it is subject to a new round of approvals from both the county and the 
Coastal Commission, and the firm is concerned that, in the event of cityhood, 
the chances of approval a second time could be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
Both lawyers for cityhood supporters and the county expressed optimism about 
the suit's outcome. 
</P>
<P>
"We think the facts and the legal arguments are on our side," Assistant County 
Counsel Bill Pellman said. "We see it as a question of looking out for the 
interests of the entire county or a minority of people in Malibu who have been 
extremely vocal." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
BACKGROUND The pro-growth majority on the Board of Supervisors has resisted 
Malibu incorporation efforts for years, and now insists that an extensive sewer 
system be approved before a cityhood election can take place. Many Malibu 
residents believe that the sewer system would simply open up the coastline to 
extensive development, and regard incorporation as the most effective way to 
limit growth.

KNOW YOUR RIGHTS, OBLIGATIONS IF HOME IS DAMAGED BY FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MERLE HENKENIUS, Henkenius is a free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
What would you do if your home were severely damaged by fire or water? Many 
people put in a quick call to their insurance agent, set up an appointment with 
an adjuster and try to settle as quickly as possible. 
</P>
<P>
According to some consumer advocates, following that scenario can cost you 
dearly. By proceeding in a more deliberate way and following all the procedures 
listed in the fine print of your homeowner's policy, you can protect yourself 
against loopholes and exceptions that can cost you money. 
</P>
<P>
Ron Alford, whose background includes 20 years as an insurance adjuster and a 
fire- and water-damage restoration specialist, is founder of the Owners Action 
Plan, a nonprofit group that advises policy holders and lobbies against what it 
perceives to be unjust practices by insurance companies. 
</P>
<P>
Following is his advice on some of the most commonly asked consumer questions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Policies Say the Owner Must Secure Premises 
</P>
<P>
 QUESTION: What should homeowners do first when they suffer a loss? 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Most policies state that it's the insured's responsibility to secure 
the property from further damage. That means that if you allow some part of 
your home or its contents to sustain further damage, the insurance company 
doesn't have to cover it. 
</P>
<P>
If the carpet is waterlogged after the firefighters are through, and you allow 
mildew to grow under it, that's your fault. If you fail to board up broken 
windows and looters carry off the TV, that's your fault. If fire or 
firefighters have left a hole in the roof and the next day it rains, the 
resulting water damage is your fault because you didn't meet your obligations 
under the terms of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
To complicate matters, if you make the repairs yourself, you won't be 
reimbursed for your trouble, since insurance companies will only pay for 
professional services. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Restoration Contractor Bill Is Paid by Insurer 
</P>
<P>
Q: By professional services, you mean such as those of a fire- and water-damage 
restoration contractor? (Check the Yellow Pages of the telephone book for such 
contractors.) 
</P>
<P>
A: Yes. If a licensed or certified restoration contractor submits an itemized 
bill, the insurance company will pay those expenses. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
General Contractors Not on Emergency Call 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not hire a general contractor to make the emergency repairs? There are 
certainly more of them and they are easier to find. 
</P>
<P>
A: Not at 3 o'clock on a Sunday morning. Besides, a general contractor is not 
in the emergency-services business. While a restoration contractor may hire 
subcontractors to do some of the work, his real specialty is getting things 
done right and in a way that meets insurance contract requirements. A general 
contractor may have the expertise to rebuild a wall, but he won't know much 
about getting the smoke residue off your furniture. 
</P>
<P>
Keep in mind that the work contract is ultimately between you and the 
contractor. If the job isn't done right, the insurance company is not going to 
step in to sort things out. It's the insurer's job to pay for the restoration, 
not to oversee it. 
</P>
<P>
If there are no certified fire- and water-damage restoration contractors in 
your immediate area, you may need to hire a specialist, such as a roofer or a 
carpenter, to secure the premises and stop further damage from occurring. But a 
restoration contractor is your best bet after that. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
When You Should Notify the Insurer 
</P>
<P>
Q: When should a homeowner call the insurance company? 
</P>
<P>
A: A homeowner should notify the insurer and arrange for an appointment with an 
adjuster right after calling for emergency services. The adjuster will need to 
assess the damage as soon as possible to protect his company's interests. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Taking Pictures of Damage Is Important 
</P>
<P>
Q: Beyond notifying the insurance company, what additional steps can a claimant 
take to help support his claim? 
</P>
<P>
A: One of the most important things you can do is to take pictures of the 
damage; a video is even better. Shoot the damage from every angle. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How to Select a Restoration Contractor 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can a homeowner assess the qualifications of a fire- and water-damage 
restoration contractor? 
</P>
<P>
A: Unfortunately, there are no national standards governing the training of 
fire- and water-damage restoration contractors. If a restoration contractor in 
your area is required to have a license, you should understand that that is a 
license to do business and not a guarantee of the contractor's competence. 
</P>
<P>
The best you can do to assure yourself that the contractor knows what he's 
doing is to ascertain whether he is a member of the National Institute of Fire 
Restoration. 
</P>
<P>
Also, ask for the phone numbers of his last five clients, and insist on an 
itemized contract of all work to be performed and materials to be used, and on 
a commitment to a completion date. If a contractor balks at any one of these 
requests, I'd move immediately to the next one on your list of candidates. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Don't Settle Before Knowing Extent of Cost 
</P>
<P>
Q: How can homeowners protect their interests when settling a claim? 
</P>
<P>
A: Above all, don't settle with the insurance company before you produce a 
comprehensive claim. Restoration work is more expensive than most people 
imagine. An on-the-spot settlement may sound good, but it may eventually fall 
far short of what you actually end up spending to get your home and life back 
to normal. Nor are you obliged by the insurance policy to settle for the lowest 
bidder when getting estimates from contractors on work to be done. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
How Can Consumer Get Help in a Dispute? 
</P>
<P>
Q: Short of a civil suit, how can an insurance consumer find affordable help in 
settling a claims dispute? 
</P>
<P>
A: You should seek immediate help from your state insurance commissioner when 
you feel your insurance company is not acting fairly. This office will offer 
some recourse, but in the end, educating yourself offers the best protection. 
</P>
<P>
Read the fine print in your contract. Document, in pictures every unusual item 
in your home, and if you think grandma's ring is worth a million dollars, you'd 
better get the insurance company to agree in writing that it is before you buy 
its policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Public Adjusters Wield Much Power 
</P>
<P>
Q: How are public adjusters paid, and how much authority do they have? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most prefer to work on 10% commission of the total collection, and they 
wield plenty of authority when you sign with them on a contingency basis. In 
essence, you'll give them a limited power of attorney. 
</P>
<P>
If your public adjuster is ethical, fine. If not, that power can be abused 
without your knowing it. I suggest hiring a public adjuster by the hour; I'd 
rather pay $125 an hour and retain legal control. Good public adjusters can be 
worth their weight in gold.

TIPS ON MANAGING LOSS FROM FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Home Mechanix 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Here are some more tips on managing your loss after a fire: 
</P>
<P>
 -- To simplify record-keeping, use separate credit cards for additional living 
expenses and for contents purchases. Also consider opening a separate checking 
account into which only insurance company checks are deposited and from which 
only checks for repairs and replacement purchases are drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Be selective about the clothes you dry clean. Some may be too old to 
warrant the expense. Wash smoke-stained sheets with ammonia added to the wash 
water. They will make handy furniture covers during debris removal and 
reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Avoid carte blanche arrangements with tradespeople; wherever possible 
obtain estimates and bids. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Consider renting local public storage space to store undamaged contents, as 
well as cleaned items as they are returned before reconstruction is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Large 22-by-22-by-50-inch wardrobe storage boxes are available from moving 
companies. They're handy for storing unneeded clothes.

SAM HALL KAPLAN: CLOSING A DECADE OF DESIGN: SOME HITS AND MISSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM HALL KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Given the day and date, an assessment of the last 10 years of architecture and 
design in Southern California is in order, along with a listing of the best, 
and worst, projects of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back, we see a decade marked by a rising design consciousness that made 
the styling of buildings a common topic, turned some architects into superstars 
and lent an intense and welcome focus to the debate over how communities should 
be planned and shaped. 
</P>
<P>
Despite this heightened awareness, as the decade ends, Southern California, in 
general, and Los Angeles, in particular, appear to be in worse shape than ever, 
scarred by discordant designs, soulless streets, abused parks and beaches, 
increasing homelessness, and a jobs-housing imbalance that exacerbates already 
exasperating traffic, and alarming air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
These problems in large part cannot be blamed on the design profession, for 
when all is said and done, design is simply a reflection of a society and its 
values, or more accurately, its lack of values and leadership. 
</P>
<P>
Not helping in the '80s were the distorted priorities of the Reagan-Bush 
administrations that stripped our social, environmental and housing programs to 
feed a bloated defense budget and milk our treasury. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one might have expected more from the design community, if only because 
of its repeated claim of being sensitive to environmental and social issues, as 
well as aesthetics. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, with a few exceptions, most designers in the '80s retreated into an 
egocentric preoccupation with fads and fashions marked by a waxing and waning 
of a succession of "isms." Communities, neighbors and even clients appeared to 
have been sacrificed in the scramble by some designers to create signature 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
At times it seemed architecture was not being practiced as a social art 
aesthetically serving a human need (a definition of the craft I prefer) but as 
a linguistic experiment, a market-driven assignment, an egotistical exercise 
or, more ignobly, a photo opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
So-called free-style architecture turned out to not be particularly free or 
stylish. Rather it tended to be pricey, crude and, for most people, irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
But to be sure, along with these nefarious efforts there also were some 
singular, user- and site-sensitive designs expressed in a refreshing, coherent 
and articulate architectural language. These we celebrate, for they remind us 
of the potential in buildings for service and joy. 
</P>
<P>
With this in mind, the following is a selection of the 10 most engaging and the 
10 most egregious architectural projects of the '80s, submitted in no 
particular order of preference and, of course, with prejudice. Noted where 
appropriate are the principals responsible. 
</P>
<P>
The Best 
</P>
<P>
Tillman Water Reclamation Plant (Anthony Lumsden, of DMJM), in the Sepulveda 
Basin, an honest, expressive high-tech complex, its critical function softened 
by imaginative landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
Cedars-Sinai Comprehensive Cancer Center (Morphosis Architects/ Gruen 
Associates), a dramatic and different health-care facility made diverting and 
personal. 
</P>
<P>
First Interstate World Center (Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners), downtown's 
newest, tallest and best office structure, with the indication that its 
distinctive cylindrical tower will be matched at the street level by an equally 
distinctive landscaping focused on the Bunker Hill steps (Larry Halprin) now 
being completed. 
</P>
<P>
Museum of Contemporary Art (Arata Isozaki, aided by Fred Nicholas and Ed 
Helfeld), a well-chiseled gem in the rather banal California Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park scattered site housing cooperative (Appleton Mechur &amp; 
Associates) and Vista Montoya (Kamnitzer &amp; Cotton), two affordable housing 
projects, in Santa Monica and Pico Union respectively, that in different, 
attractive styles demonstrate a respect for both residents and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola Law School (Frank Gehry) a witty, playful collection of fragmented 
structures forming a singular in-town campus. 
</P>
<P>
Wiltern Theatre restoration (Levin &amp; Associates, inspired by Wayne 
Ratkovich), a sensitive restoration of the Mid-Wilshire Art Deco landmark. 
</P>
<P>
Florence Hotel renovation (UCLA's Urban Innovations Group, working with Andy 
Raubeson), one of a number of single-room residences that were upgraded in a 
laudable effort to provide decent housing on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
XXIII Olympiad (Jerde Partnership/ Sussman Prejza &amp; Co.) an inventive 
styling of a so-called kit-of-parts that gave spirit and identity to the 
scattered permanent and temporary facilities used to hold the Games. 
</P>
<P>
The Worst 
</P>
<P>
Mini-malls, the generic and ubiquitous convenience shopping centers. With too 
few exceptions, they created eyesores, aggravated traffic, sliced up sidewalks 
and destroyed scale and massing of streetscapes. 
</P>
<P>
Pershing Square. Millions of dollars were spent, but unfortunately, most on a 
competition, consultants, junkets, receptions and salaries, while the forlorn 
park continued to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
Beaudry Center (Collier-Deutsch) and the W.C.T. tower (World Chinese Trust), 
the Mutt and Jeff of office structures defacing the west bank of the Harbor 
Freeway. The WCT building is also known as the "twisted tower." 
</P>
<P>
First United Methodist Church demolition downtown and the Pan Pacific 
Auditorium burning in the Fairfax District. The landmark church was cleared to 
make way for a new Southern California Gas Co. headquarters that was never 
built and the beloved Pan destroyed while politicians procrastinated over plans 
for its recycling. 
</P>
<P>
Home Savings Bank (Tim Vreeland of A.C. Martin) downtown, and overdesigned 
inside and out. May not be one of the worst but it's one of silliest. 
</P>
<P>
Melrose Avenue street widening, resulted in the narrowing of the sidewalk of 
one of L.A.'s most pedestrian-active streets, making it hard to window-shop and 
enjoy the passing crowds. Imagine what it would be like if the sidewalk was 
widened for cafes, benches and shade trees.

Edgemar (Frank Gehry), the mixed-use project in Santa Monica that, despite all 
the stated good intentions, feels less like the center of a Tuscan hill town it 
is described as in the various awards it has received, and more like a 
minimum-security prison. 
</P>
<P>
Gehry was without peer the local emperor of architecture of the '80s. At times 
his clothes were just right for the occasion, as they were for the Loyola Law 
School. Other times, such as Edgemar, they seemed to be in need of some radical 
tailoring to fit. When you are the emperor everyone notices.

Aaron Spelling residence, which at 56,500 square feet, should be considered a 
congregate living facility and not a single-family home, and therefore in 
violation of Holmby Hills zoning. 
</P>
<P>
What Spelling's folly is, of course, is a sad commentary on the distorted 
values that have taken the architectural form of monster mansions at a time 
when tens of thousands of persons are homeless. 
</P>
<P>
From my perspective, homelessness was architecture's worst "project" of the 
'80s and a national shame. 
</P>

In the next decade, may the best flourish.Los Angeles Times photos

REAL ESTATE Q &amp; A: DIVORCE AND TAXES: HOW TO DEFER PROFITS FROM SALE OF 
YOUR HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. BRUSS, Letters and comments to Robert J. Bruss, a San 
Francisco-area lawyer, author and real estate broker, may be sent him at P.O. 
Box 280038, San Francisco 94128.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUESTION: My soon-to-be-ex-wife and I are getting a divorce and selling our 
home. We paid around $82,500 for it and should receive about $175,000 from its 
sale. My questions concern how much tax we will owe on the sale, and if there 
is any way we can avoid paying tax. 
</P>
<P>
ANSWER: Presuming you and your ex-wife are dividing the sale of your former 
principal residence equally and neither of you is 55 or older, you can each 
qualify for 100% tax deferral profit if you each buy a qualifying replacement 
principal residence. However, if only you or only your wife buys a replacement 
home, then just that one spouse gets to defer tax on their share of the profit 
and the other spouse must pay tax on their profit share. 
</P>
<P>
When using the "roll-over residence replacement rule" of Internal Revenue Code 
1034, all that really matters is your net (adjusted) sales price. 
</P>
<P>
As an illustration, let's presume your home sells for $175,000 after paying 
sales costs, such as the realty sales commission. Dividing $175,000 by two 
means that to defer tax on your half of the sales profit, you must buy a 
replacement principal residence costing at least $87,500 within 24 months 
before or after the sale. 
</P>
<P>
Even if your ex-spouse doesn't buy a replacement home but you do, you can 
qualify for tax deferral while your ex-wife pays tax on her profit share. 
Please consult your tax adviser for full details. 
</P>

<P>
 Telling the Truth About Time-Shares 
</P>
<P>
Q: Several months ago, you said the big problem with time-shares was that there 
is virtually no resale market. As the owner of a rather desirable Hawaiian 
time-share, I fully agree. Yes, there are a few auctioneers, but they usually 
sell time-shares at very distressed prices. Since you never seem to hold back 
what you are thinking, what do you really think about time-shares? 
</P>
<P>
A: Every time I answer a question about time-shares I receive incredible 
pressure from those in the time-share industry who try to "re-educate" me. I 
have had to ask some of them not to contact me further because they have worn 
out their welcome. 
</P>
<P>
As I've said before, the time-share developers earn huge profits. They are 
selling future vacations, which is fine. But nobody should invest money they 
ever want to see again. The reason is that it is almost impossible to get out 
of a time-share purchase for the amount paid. Even the time-share promoters 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
I do not like time-shares and do not recommend them. Time-shares are not real 
estate investments. Rather, they are purchases of future vacations. The very 
limited resale market that exists sells these time-shares at distress prices. 
Buying a time-share in a desirable complex in the resale market from a 
distressed seller can be a great place to buy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Bankruptcy Filing No Foreclosure Protection 
</P>
<P>
Q: Due to unemployment and illness, I have been unable to make my mortgage 
payments. Last February, the mortgage company started foreclosure. In March I 
filed bankruptcy to stop the foreclosure. But in May the bankruptcy judge said 
the mortgage company could proceed to foreclose. Last month, they sold my house 
at auction and I am now being evicted by the buyer. I thought filing bankruptcy 
stopped them from foreclosing. How can this happen to me? 
</P>
<P>
A: Filing bankruptcy only delays real estate foreclosure. If you don't work out 
a satisfactory mortgage payment plan, the mortgage lender can get the automatic 
stay against foreclosure lifted. That is apparently what happened. 
</P>
<P>
Since the foreclosure sale was approved by the bankruptcy court when the 
automatic stay was removed, unless the sale was incorrectly handled, it appears 
you have no further rights in your home. Please consult a real estate attorney 
for further details. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Promising Cure for 'Buyer's Remorse' 
</P>
<P>
Q: My husband and I signed a contract to buy a home. The realty agent arranged 
what, I admit, is a terrific fixed-rate mortgage. But I'm not sure about my 
job, as I've heard the hospital where I work as a nurse might be cutting back. 
Fortunately, my husband owns his company and business is booming. But without 
my paycheck, I'm not sure we can afford this house. How can we get out of our 
purchase contract, as I am scared we won't be able to afford the payments? 
</P>
<P>
A: It sounds like you have a very serious case of "buyer's remorse." The best 
remedy for this non-fatal disease is to consider the pros and cons of that 
house you agreed to buy. 
</P>
<P>
Please list all the advantages of buying, such as a home meeting the needs of 
your family, in a desirable part of town, for a reasonable purchase price and 
with favorable financing. I'm certain you can list other advantages. 
</P>
<P>
Now try to think of any disadvantages. Perhaps a large mortgage payment, but 
with a large itemized interest deduction on your tax returns. Maybe you won't 
be able to make the mortgage payment if you lose your job. But I hear 
registered nurses have no trouble finding jobs so, at the worst, you might be 
out of work an hour or two. 
</P>
<P>
If it is any comfort, most home buyers suffer the same buyer's remorse you are 
encountering. I remember contracting this dread disease the first night I lay 
awake in my new home worrying about how I would ever make the mortgage 
payments. Fortunately, I made the next payment and all 132 payments since then. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, my home has more than quadrupled in market value, has been a very 
comfortable place to enjoy living and has provided some outstanding income tax 
advantages, too. I'm certain your new home will be an equally profitable 
investment once you get over your non-serious case of buyer's remorse. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Double Joint Tenancy in 2-Family Duplex 
</P>
<P>
Q: You are not going to believe this, but my wife and I want to buy a 
two-family duplex house with my in-laws. They are wonderful people who treat me 
like a son. My wife and I have two children who get along great with their 
grandparents. We found a huge two-family duplex house where my in-laws would 
live in the two-bedroom unit and our family will live in the four-bedroom unit. 
</P>
<P>
They will be making the down payment, and we have agreed to split the monthly 
payment on a one-third, two-thirds basis. The problem is how to hold title. We 
all want to own the property as joint tenants with right of survivorship. But 
my wife thinks we should own half and her parents should own half, as joint 
tenants. Can this be done? 
</P>
<P>
A: Of course. Although you didn't indicate the ownership shares, I presume each 
couple will own one-half the property. In other words, each couple can own 
their half as joint tenants with right of survivorship. When one spouse dies, 
the surviving spouse then owns that half as surviving joint tenant. In other 
words, you will have a double joint tenancy in the two-family duplex. A real 
estate attorney can prepare the deed. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Risk of Buying a Home 'Subject to' Mortgage 
</P>
<P>
Q: Almost six months ago, we bought our first home. I admit we were rather 
uneducated and the sellers took advantage of us. However, the price was a good 
deal so we really can't complain. But the problem is the mortgage. The seller 
said we could "take over" the payments on their old mortgage. Not knowing any 
better, we did so. 
</P>
<P>
A few months ago we received a nasty letter from the lender stating that if we 
did not agree to raise the loan's interest rate from 8.75% to 10%, the lender 
would call the loan. When I contacted the sellers, they said the lender told 
them we could take over the loan. The lender denies any such statement. If the 
interest rate is increased, our monthly payment will go up substantially. What 
should we do? 
</P>
<P>
A: Rather than assuming the existing mortgage, it appears you bought the home 
"subject to" the old loan. If it contains a due-on-sale clause, the lender is 
entitled to call the loan if the property is transferred to new ownership. 
However, if there is no due-on-sale clause or the lender told the seller it 
could be assumed by a buyer, then the lender cannot call the loan or increase 
your interest rate. 
</P>
<P>
Your first step is to get a copy of the promissory note and mortgage. Then read 
it to see if there is a due-on-sale clause. If not, the lender cannot call the 
mortgage. If there is a due-on-sale clause, consult a real estate attorney 
about negotiating with the lender and the seller. Incidentally, the seller may 
still have liability on that mortgage if you default and the lender suffers a 
foreclosure loss. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Amount of Earnest Money Is Disputed 
</P>
<P>
Q: As a real estate agent, I find I must read your articles otherwise my buyers 
and sellers tell me what you had to say and I appear to be ignorant. But I must 
take issue with you about your suggestion that home buyers make as small an 
earnest money deposit as the seller is willing to accept. That's baloney. As a 
longtime realty agent, I know, as I'm certain you do, too, that the larger the 
deposit, the greater the probability the buyer will complete the home purchase 
as agreed. Don't you think it's time you change your thinking and tell buyers 
to make earnest money deposits of at least 10% of the sales price? 
</P>
<P>
A: Sorry, I can't agree. Yes, when I am a property seller I want a substantial 
earnest money deposit. If I feel the buyer's deposit is inadequate, I can make 
a larger deposit requirement part of my counteroffer. 
</P>
<P>
However, when I am a buyer I want to make as small a deposit as possible, just 
in case the seller can't or won't deliver the property on the terms agreed. I 
want to tie up as little cash as possible until the sale is ready to close. 
From your viewpoint as a realty agent, I fully understand why you want buyers 
to make large earnest money deposits. However, we will have to agree to 
disagree on this issue. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Net Listings Can Be Troublesome, Illegal 
</P>
<P>
Q: I want to net a specific amount for the sale of my land. However, I cannot 
find a decent real estate agent who will take my listing. I know my land is not 
easy to sell and want to give the agent maximum incentive. Why can't I find any 
agent who will take my net listing? 
</P>
<P>
A: Most real estate agents are aware of the pitfalls of net listings, which are 
illegal in some states. As a property seller, you should be grateful the agents 
you contacted wouldn't accept your net listing. 
</P>
<P>
Problems can develop with net listings in several ways. If the agent obtains a 
low offer below your net price, the agent might be tempted to lose that offer 
and never deliver it to you because the agent would receive no sales 
commission. However, if the agent obtains a purchase offer substantially above 
your net price, you would feel the agent failed to inform you of the true value 
of your property and you would probably insist the agent adjust the sales 
commission.

IN A FOREST OF TANGLED TREES ON A LONG PENINSULA BY THE SEA, A VISIONARY NAMED

OF BRICK, STONE AND ECCENTRIC DREAMS;

PORTMEIRION, Wales 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
While the upper reaches of Wales' highest peak are frequently lost in mists, 
stone farmhouses far below stand out against the hillsides -- their slate roofs 
glistening in a driving rain that turns the sod a shocking green. 
</P>
<P>
Swollen streams cascade over rocks, and waterfalls tumble into lush valleys. 
Such is the scene in North Wales, with monuments as old as the Pyramids, a land 
where Druids and Celts built megaliths to a vanished golden age and the legend 
of King Arthur was born. No country in the Western world has an older language 
-- still spoken -- or an older literature. 
</P>
<P>
It is here, in a forest of tangled trees on a long peninsula by the sea, that a 
visionary named Sir Clough Williams-Ellis built his very own Camelot and named 
it Portmeirion. 
</P>
<P>
He put together this enclave, piece by piece, like a jigsaw puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
It took Williams-Ellis, an architect, nearly half a century to create his 
dream, a dream he fashioned after his own eccentric whims. One house led to 
another until an entire village appeared. 
</P>
<P>
When Williams-Ellis purchased the site in 1925, only a single mansion 
overlooked Traeth Bach, an estuary that flows to the Irish Sea. 
</P>
<P>
After this, Williams-Ellis traveled across Europe, rescuing buildings from 
destruction and incorporating them into his unique village. 
</P>
<P>
From 1925 to 1972, when the last building was set in place, Portmeirion became 
his not-so-private passion. 
</P>
<P>
After converting the original old mansion, with its sea-washed terrace, into a 
hotel, now known as Main House, he built his first guest cottages. This was in 
1926. 
</P>
<P>
Today, travelers seek shelter in rooms, suites and small apartments whose names 
(Royal Dolphin, Anchor and Watch House) relate to Portmeirion's proximity to 
the Irish Sea. 
</P>
<P>
Sun-washed, pastel-colored towers co-exist with Georgian houses, and with 
twilight, Portmeirion takes on the soft shades of Portofino, that distant 
Italian village which inspired Williams-Ellis to create Portmeirion. 
</P>
<P>
Yet Portmeirion projects its own peculiar personality, what with peacocks 
parading under peppermint-striped awnings, and dwarf-size doorways and 
staircases that end abruptly. Everything is slightly askew, and the closer you 
look, the more surreal it becomes. 
</P>
<P>
A bristol colonnade rises dead center of the cobblestone village, and gilded 
Burmese dancers from Asia perch atop Ionic columns not far from a giant Buddha. 
</P>
<P>
If all this strikes you as some sort of Mad Hatter's dream, then the picture is 
emerging. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Portmeirion was the site of a castle, which a Welsh prince owned -- an 
ancestor of Williams-Ellis. By 1851, the mansion called Main House took shape, 
featuring a garden profuse with Oriental blooms. 
</P>
<P>
The Portmeirion created by Williams-Ellis was intended to stand as a "living 
protest" against the havoc being wreaked by modern developers. 
</P>
<P>
Considering the indiscriminate development pursued throughout the world today, 
Williams-Ellis without question was a visionary, a rebel who was years ahead of 
his time. 
</P>
<P>
Following the development of Portmeirion, a number of artists were attracted. 
Bertrand Russell became a resident; Frank Lloyd Wright paid a visit. Years 
later, Noel Coward was inspired to write his other-worldly work, "Blithe 
Spirit." 
</P>
<P>
It also was in Portmeirion that the cult-classic 1960s television series, "The 
Prisoner," was filmed. As a spinoff to the series, a village shop does a lively 
business selling "Prisoner" souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
While Portmeirion was being developed, Williams-Ellis continued to travel, 
collecting exotic flora. 
</P>
<P>
Violet and rose-colored rhododendrons bloom alongside azaleas, feral lilies and 
magnolias. These same gardens inspired the internationally known Portmeirion 
pottery pattern that is locally made and sold at village shops. 
</P>
<P>
Visitors, though, are drawn to the Main House with its 18th-Century oak 
staircase, its elaborate bar decorated in fabrics from India, and its great 
stone fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
Each of its 14 guest rooms is styled differently; dinner in the white, 
antique-filled dining room is replete with silver service and harp 
accompaniment, and sweeping views of the estuary add to the magic of the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
Today, 250,000 visitors travel to Portmeirion each year to see Williams-Ellis' 
creation. It is up to the visitor to interpret for himself this uninhibited 
symbol of one man's dream. 
</P>
<P>
Getting There: By car, Portmeirion is 4 1/2 hours from London. Take the M1, M6 
and M54, then the A5 as far as the Bala exit (three miles past Corwen). Follow 
the signs for Porthmadog. Portmeirion is one mile beyond Penrhyndeudraeth. 
</P>
<P>
By rail, leave London's Euston Station for Bangor, which is a four-hour 
journey. From Bangor, Portmeirion is about a 45-minute drive. Alternately, 
change at Llandudno Junction for Blaneau Ffestiniog, which is near Portmeirion. 
</P>
<P>
Hotels and Cottages: Rooms and suites in the Main House at Portmeirion cost 
from about $110 to $170 U.S. for the sumptuous Peacock Suite. Village cottages 
are about $75 for a double to $85 for a suite with sitting room. During the 
village's low seasons (March 5 to May 26 and September 23 to March, 1990), 
prices are a trifle lower. 
</P>
<P>
All accommodations feature private baths, color television, direct-dial 
telephones and tea- and coffee-making facilities. 
</P>
<P>
Restaurants: A four-course dinner at the hotel restaurant costs about $28 to 
$40. Weekdays, the chef offers a buffet lunch for about $17, and there is 
terrace dining when weather permits. Day visitors are welcome at luncheons and 
during dinner. 
</P>
<P>
Facilities Within Portmeirion: Eight shops do business in the village, 
including a Portmeirion Pottery Warehouse that sells slightly flawed pottery at 
reasonable prices. The Ship Shop sells various Welsh gifts, and the Cara 
boutique offers women's fashions with a distinctive local flavor. 
</P>
<P>
Season: The best time to visit North Wales is during the late spring or summer, 
although the hotel and grounds are open all year. The hotel and cottages 
accommodate 140 guests. For details, write Hotel Portmeirion, Gwynedd, North 
Wales LL48 6ER, or see your travel agent.

<TEXT>
<P>
I've seen the lights of gay Broadway, 
</P>
<P>
 Old Market Street down by Frisco Bay, 
</P>
<P>
 I've strolled the Prado, 
</P>
<P>
 I've gambled on the Bourse, 
</P>
<P>
 The seven wonders of the world I've seen, 
</P>
<P>
 And many are the places I have been, 
</P>
<P>
 Take my advice folks, 
</P>
<P>
 And see Beale Street first. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
W. C. Handy wrote those words in 1916, immortalizing this city's most famous 
thoroughfare in the "Beale Street Blues." 
</P>
<P>
The lyrics sang the praises of Handy's lively hometown neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
Beale Street was where the jazz man created the blues while working its honky 
tonks as a young man with a trumpet and an ear for the melancholy music of the 
Mississippi Delta cotton fields just to the south. 
</P>
<P>
Handy shaped and nurtured the sound and put it on paper -- and America had its 
first original music. 
</P>
<P>
In more modern times, the famous street went through a bad case of economic 
blues, along with the rest of downtown Memphis. Businesses and people moved to 
the suburbs, and the ornate buildings that were Beale's nightspots, cafes, pawn 
shops and gambling parlors nearly fell before the wrecking ball. 
</P>
<P>
Even The Peabody Hotel, a legendary Mid-South institution standing just a block 
off Beale (149 Union Ave., toll-free 800-732-2639 or 901-529-4000), shut down 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
But the bad times are all behind the area now. It has been born again, thanks 
to almost $1 billion sunk into downtown development during the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
The seven blocks of Beale are thriving as a National Historic District, and The 
Peabody, replete with its famous lobby fountain full of cavorting ducks, once 
again lives up to author/historian David Cohn's 1935 description: 
</P>
<P>
"The Mississippi Delta begins in the lobby of The Peabody and ends on Catfish 
Row in Vicksburg. The Peabody is the Paris Ritz, the Cairo Shepheard's, the 
London Savoy." 
</P>
<P>
The hotel's ducks began as a joke more than a half-century ago, but were such 
an instant hit with guests and passers-by that now a 50-foot red carpet is 
rolled out for them while a band plays John Philip Sousa's "King Cotton March" 
each day as they waddle toward the fountain. 
</P>
<P>
They live on the hotel's rooftop in the "Royal Duck Palace," described by its 
architects as "a fairy tale bird cage with banners flying." 
</P>
<P>
A short stroll from The Peabody is the personification of Memphis' renaissance 
-- Mud Island, an island that's an all-Mississippi River learning experience, 
an elaborate complex of family attractions rising on mud salvaged from the 
river where visitors learn a good deal about "The Big Muddy" -- the river's 
history, its disasters, its folklore and about Memphis. 
</P>
<P>
As for Memphis, the city boasts of being "The Home of America's Music. Handy 
wrote his first "blues notes" for a local politician's campaign in 1909. 
Forty-five years later, a young delivery truck driver wandered into an 
unpretentious little building on Union Avenue to pay money and record a song 
for his mother. 
</P>
<P>
His name was Elvis Presley. 
</P>
<P>
Presley's was an altogether new sound, blending blues, gospel, and country and 
rhythm into what Sun Studios owner-operator Sam Phillips recognized as being 
"something mighty special -- mighty sellable." 
</P>
<P>
The presence, the mystique, of Elvis is everywhere in his adopted hometown. The 
kid from Tupelo, Miss., made a down-and-out, pay-as-you-record studio a 
hallowed place where throngs stand in line to take daily tours. 
</P>
<P>
They're primarily conducted in the peeling, cracking soundproof room where 
Presley and such subsequent rockers as Jerry Lee Lewis, Carl Perkins, Roy 
Orbison, Johnny Cash and Charlie Rich produced 45 hit records during a 
nine-year span.

January, Elvis' birth month (he was born Jan. 8), and August, the month he died 
(Aug. 16), particularly lure both the adoring and the curious to Memphis. Their 
pilgrimages take them to Sun Studios, Presley's larger-than-life statue on 
Beale Street, not far from Handy Park, where the blues king has his own statue, 
and even to Presley's old high school, Humes. 
</P>
<P>
The annual Elvis Presley International Tribute Week takes place next year from 
Aug. 12-18. There's a full schedule of daily events for the faithful at 
Presley's beloved home, Graceland (3717 Elvis Presley Blvd., 800-238-2000 or 
901-332-3322). 
</P>
<P>
Elvis imitators are among the potpourri of entertainers in mid-town Memphis, at 
popular Overton Square. There's an upscaled array of music halls, shops and 
restaurants there, plus a professional theater. 
</P>
<P>
But the queen of theaters in Memphis is the Orpheum Theatre, at the corner of 
Main and Beale streets. That grand old vaudeville house has been lovingly 
restored and transformed into a glittering center for the performing arts, 
regularly offering Broadway shows, concerts and operas. 
</P>
<P>
"I'd rather play the Orpheum than anywhere," said blues favorite B.B. King, who 
came out of the Mississippi Delta to get his singing start on Beale in the 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
Still on Beale, the finest blues performers entertain nightly at the Rum Boogie 
Cafe and Club Royale, and at Lou's Place, a few blocks from Beale at 94 S. 
Front St. 
</P>
<P>
On weekends, there's also Mr. Handy's Blues Hall, next door to the Rum Boogie, 
while impromptu performances out along Beale give the area an ongoing 
street-party atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
The fun continues in A. Schwab's Dry Goods Store (163 Beale St.) , a virtually 
unchanged Beale fixture since 1876. Schwab's slogan is: "If you can't find it 
here, you're better off without it." 
</P>
<P>
Bursting with civic pride and never short on claims, Memphis also declares 
itself to be "The Capital of Southern Cooking" as well as "Pork Barbecue 
Capital of the World." Vivian Holley, a writer and food expert from Roswell, 
Ga., agrees with the barbecue boast: "It is the best I've experienced." 
</P>
<P>
Food is an essential part of the 150 or so special events held throughout the 
city each year, and especially during the grandest fete of them all -- the 
Memphis in May International Festival. 
</P>
<P>
This monthlong extravaganza, which begins next year on Friday, April 27, honors 
a different country annually and attracts more than a million visitors, who 
enjoy such doings as the World Championship Barbecue Cooking Contest. 
</P>
<P>
Of the 100-plus barbecue outlets in Memphis, the most popular with locals is a 
rambling museum/beer hall in a restaurant called The Rendezvous (52 S. Second 
St., 901-523-2746). 
</P>
<P>
Cotton was king long before Presley in Memphis, and huge profits from the crop 
led to the building of dozens of great mansions throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
A few are open to the public in Victorian Village, a downtown array of 
architectural masterpieces. Heritage continues at the Pink Palace Museum (3050 
Central Ave.), built and initially stocked after a bequest from the man who 
started America's first self-service grocery store in the city. 
</P>
<P>
The famed Kress Collection of Renaissance art is housed in the Brooks Museum of 
Art (1905 Overton Park Ave.), currently undergoing a space-doubling expansion. 
There's rare Impressionist art and porcelain at the Dixon Gallery and Gardens 
(4339 Park Ave.), and Memphis State University's Institute of Egyptian Art and 
Archeology has some of the rarest works this side of Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
Jim Cooper is one of several instructors at the National Ornamental Metal 
Museum (374 W. California Ave.), a facility high above the Mississippi and 
dedicated to the preservation of the art and craft of metal-working. Cooper's 
after-hours classes in Repair and Creative Ironwork usually are filled to 
capacity. 
</P>
<P>
Other looks into Memphis's colorful past are available at the Chucalissa Indian 
Village (1987 Indian Village Drive), a working reconstruction of an ancient 
Choctaw community, and at the Magevney House (198 Adams Ave.), home of the 
city's first schoolmaster in the 1830s. 
</P>
<P>
The National Civil Rights Center is scheduled to open in 1991 on the site of 
the Lorraine Motel, 406 Mulberry St., where Dr. Martin Luther King was 
assassinated. It will have an interpretive education center and memorabilia 
tracing the nation's Civil Rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
When you think you've seen it all, Memphis offers more. Nature at its Mid-South 
best can be experienced at the Memphis Botanic Gardens (750 Cherry Road), now 
undergoing a $20-million expansion, and at the Lichterman Nature Center, a 
quiet place in the heart of town at 5992 Quince Road. 
</P>
<P>
There's Libertyland (940 Early Maxwell Blvd.), a patriotic theme park near the 
Liberty Bowl football stadium. Both structures are adjacent to the sprawling 
Mid-South Fairgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
In the eastern part of the city, Adventure River Waterpark (6800 Whitten Bend 
Cove) is one of the largest aquatic parks in the country, and the new Memphis 
International Motorsports Park (5500 Taylor Forge Road) is the biggest 
multi-purpose racing complex in the world. 
</P>
<P>
The Overton Park Shell, in 342-acre Overton Park, with its spring-through-fall 
programs of blues, rock 'n' roll and jazz, has the double-distinction of being 
the Mid-South's oldest outdoor theater and the site of Presley's first live 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
But wherever you go in Memphis, there's one thing you'll see for sure -- 
friendly faces. And, perhaps you'll find yourself telling others what Handy did 
in "The Memphis Blues": 
</P>
<P>
 Folks, I've just been down . . . down to Memphis town. That's where the people 
smile ... smile on you all the while. Hos-pi-tal-i-ty, they were good to me. 
</P>

Although old Hawaii with its grass shacks is but a melancholy memory, it's 
still possible to escape the pressure cooker by jetting to remote spots on 
these islands. I used to have a romance going with the legendary Waiohai, the 
little resort at Poipu -- on the island of Kauai. This was before the 
developers trashed it and replaced it with a major hotel. Still, there are 
pockets in paradise. A new 144-page guide, "The Islands of Hawaii," contains 
information on accommodations, activities, entertainment, tours. Clues to 
hideaways on Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, Lanai and the Big Island. For a free 
copy, telephone toll-free (800) 356-3377.

New York Inns: More than 100 country inns/B&amp;Bs spread across New York state 
are named in a new guide with listings by region. Takes in areas from Albion to 
Windham. A map in the centerfold to assist motorists. At the back of the guide 
there's a listing of tourist agencies that offer additional information on 
accommodations, activities, attractions. Sells for $2. Contact Branys, P.O. Box 
862, Canandaigua, N.Y. 14424.

Bahamas Hideaway: Shauna Pickett-Gordon of Los Angeles took our advice and 
vacationed at Nettie Symonette's Casuarinas Hotel in the Bahamas. "Just 
returned after 10 days. Can't imagine spending money on Las Vegas-style resorts 
in Nassau and missing the real Bahamas. Nettie and her family made us feel 
welcome in a special way, recommending places to dine, offering advice on 
tours. The hotel has both regular and housekeeping units. Nettie grows her own 
vegetables, herbs. The hotel's Round House Restaurant serves a variety of 
native dishes at reasonable prices -- about 60% of what you'd pay in the casino 
hotels in Nassau. The other restaurant, Albion's, serves 
conch-snapper-grouper-beans 'n' rice specialties. Nettie's was a real treat."

Heart's Hideaway: A note from C.D. of Redondo Beach: "A couple of years ago you 
wrote about a romantic Italian village south of Naples and a resort that's 
built into a cliff. Do you still have the address?" Write to Hotel San Pietro, 
84017 Positano, Italy. Overlooks the Tyrhenian Sea on the Amalfi Drive. Only a 
short hydrofoil ride from Capri. Rooms are cleverly hidden among the ledges of 
a cliff that drops straight away to the sea. No two alike. Great spot for 
honeymooners. So is Positano. I rate it among my favorite places in Europe. 
This is also the village that enchanted John Steinbeck. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco: Following October's big shake, San Francisco is back wooing 
vacationers. Particularly in Japantown. A new folder describes Japanese shops, 
restaurants, hotels. Eighteen categories ranging from art galleries to travel 
services. Imported items include furniture, folk crafts, jewelry, books, tapes, 
toys. Hotels include the 125-room Kyoto Inn and the 218-room Miyako. Both 
Western and Japanese accommodations. For a free copy of the Japantown folder, 
send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to the Japan Center, 1520 Webster St., 
San Francisco 94115.

BIKING IN THE INYOS CAN TAKE YOUR BREATH AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
<P>
CERRO GORDO, Calif. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As we carried our bikes across a narrow rock ledge, falling stones echoed from 
the canyon below. 
</P>
<P>
We were following an ancient mining trail along a strip of southeastern 
California's Cerro Gordo Peak, and the steep slope beneath our perch fell away 
nearly a mile into the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
We had been pushing our mountain bikes over terrain too rough to ride. What had 
started as a Jeep road quickly degenerated into a sagebrush-and-cactus-choked 
patch. 
</P>
<P>
The Inyos are desert mountains, with no flowing streams, few springs and little 
vegetation. Joshua trees dot the rocky slopes in lonely isolation. A few 
scattered ridgelines support tenacious stands of pinon pine and mountain 
mahogany, adding the only touch of green to an otherwise dry, dusty landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Due west of the Inyos rise the high peaks of the Sierra Nevada. The two ranges 
run parallel for about 80 miles, separated by a scant 15 to 25 miles across the 
trench-like depths of the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
While checking out a topographic map of the Inyos some time ago, I came across 
the crest of the range that began at the ghost town of Cerro Gordo and ran 
north for about 15 miles at an average elevation of 9,000 feet. If it could be 
ridden with mountain bikes, it would surely be a haute route extraordinaire. 
</P>
<P>
Only one way to find out. 
</P>
<P>
Back at our narrow ledge, we decided to continue across the eroding slope and 
follow the old mining trail. The only alternative was to backtrack to a road we 
could see snaking far below. 
</P>
<P>
The low road dropped at least 1,500 feet. We dismissed this option. The high 
trail at least remained level. Finally, we carried our bikes across the 
mountainside, hoping the old trail would eventually become rideable again. 
</P>
<P>
We turned our attention to spectacular views across the valley to the Sierra 
and the table-flat floor of the Owens Valley, 5,000 feet below. 
</P>
<P>
Eye-level across the void, the jagged crest of the Sierra climbed 10,000 feet 
in a single frozen wave of granite to its zenith at Mt. Whitney, the highest 
point in the continental United States, at 14,494 feet. 
</P>
<P>
Our trail followed a disintegrating pipeline once used to supply spring water 
to the mining town of Cerro Gordo, where we'd begun our trek. Ahead, our trail 
at last joined a Jeep road. It was a wearying ride. Pedaling bikes fully loaded 
with camping gear and extra water was a workout at 9,000 feet in such thin air. 
</P>
<P>
Once we gained the true crest of the range, the road leveled off and improved 
tremendously. We were now riding long stretches of several miles interrupted 
only occasionally by short, rocky sections where we had to dismount and walk 
our bikes. 
</P>
<P>
Incredibly, the views grew more breathtaking. To the west, the sun shone across 
granite walls along a 60-mile stretch of the High Sierra. To the east, we gazed 
8,000 feet to the salt-encrusted floor of the Saline Valley. Beyond the Saline, 
dark rows of dry desert mountain ranges rolled away into a blue haze across 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
We set up camp on the summit of Peak 9,437 (few of the peaks are named in the 
seldom-visited Inyos), just as the sun dropped behind the Sierra. It commanded 
a 360-degree view. 
</P>
<P>
The vegetation was sparse, and while we unpacked, a low moan quickly became a 
screaming gale across the bare summit. We built a small, U-shaped rock 
windbreak and laid out our sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
The night was fierce, but dawn broke with an icy calm as we pedaled away on the 
last nine miles of the crest route, rounding a bend to face the summit of Mt. 
Whitney. 
</P>
<P>
Back at Cerro Gordo, we agreed that the Inyo Crest was about as spectacular a 
route as we'd ever ridden. We also agreed that it was one of the most 
demanding. High altitude, up-and-down riding with full panniers is much more 
difficult than day-touring at lower elevations. 
</P>
<P>
The route could have been ridden without gear, fast and light, in one long day, 
but camping out proved to be at least half the fun. 
</P>
<P>
There are several less-taxing mountain bike routes in the Owens Valley. The 
Buttermilk area, just outside the town of Bishop on U.S. 395, offers dozens of 
dirt roads that wind through fantastically shaped granite boulders and spires 
at the foot of Mt. Tom and Mt. Humphreys. 
</P>
<P>
A challenging four-wheel-drive track climbs from sagebrush desert all the way 
to Horton Lake, an alpine gem cupped in High Sierra granite at 10,000 feet. You 
can set up a base camp at your car just off one of the area's many dirt roads, 
and ride out on day-trip explorations. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama Hills at the base of Mt. Whitney is another great spot. Just above 
the town of Lone Pine on U.S. 395, the Hill's mazelike tangle of roads and 
"boulder forests" would take weeks to explore fully. 
</P>
<P>
The views of Mt. Whitney on one side and the Inyos on the other are 
outstanding. The Hills are mostly administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management, so you can camp anywhere you like. 
</P>
<P>
 -- -- -- 
</P>
<P>
Choosing the best time of year for a mountain bike tour of the Owens Valley 
depends on how high you'd like to ride. 
</P>
<P>
The Inyo Crest is snowed-in for the winter. Generally by mid-March or April, 
temperatures will have moderated and most of the snow will be gone. Spring is a 
good time to ride the crest because remnant snow patches make reliable sources 
of water along what is an otherwise dry route. 
</P>
<P>
The Crest and other high-elevation routes in the area are good choices for the 
hot summer months, too, when valley-bottom temperatures can soar into the 100s. 
You can ride through Inyo Crest, typically, through November. 
</P>
<P>
The Alabama Hills and Buttermilk areas can be explored year-round. Both areas 
are sagebrush desert, and for the most part remain snow-free. 
</P>
<P>
Each season has its own special appeal in this area. A spring tour will allow 
you to cruise through blooming cactus gardens while looking up at the still 
snow-covered High Sierra. Summer months are for those who like it hot and 
sunny. Fall offers warm days, cool nights and an impressive display of color as 
the valley cottonwood and aspen turn from green to gold. 
</P>
<P>
The town of Lone Pine lies about 210 miles north of Los Angeles via California 
14 and U.S. 395. Either way it's about a four- to five-hour drive into the 
Owens Valley. If you're headed for Bishop, stay on U.S. 395 past Lone Pine for 
60 more miles. 
</P>
<P>
Accommodations in Lone Pine include the Dow Villa Motel, which has a view of 
Mt. Whitney and a year-round outdoor hot spa (rates: $48 double/$42 single; 
toll-free (800) 824-9317), and the Frontier Best Western ($38 double/$34 
single; (800) 528-1234). 
</P>
<P>
Recommended restaurants: the Sportsman's Cafe, 206 S. Main, and the Bonanza 
Family restaurant, 104 N. Main. 
</P>
<P>
Bishop has dozens of motels, including the Best Western Westerner ($45 
double/$40 single, (800) 356-3221), and Bishop Travel Lodge ($40-$47 double/$36 
single, (800) 255-3050). 
</P>
<P>
Try the Firehouse Grill at the northern end of town if you're in the mood for 
an elegant dinner, or Jack's Waffle Shop for good coffee shop fare. 
</P>
<P>
For general information on the area, including weather updates, call the 
Interagency Visitor Center at (619) 876-4252. It's a mile south of Lone Pine on 
U.S. 395, and is open every day.

ONLY IN L.A.: PEOPLE AND EVENTS

<TEXT>
<P>
It was a year that seemed to have everything from A to Zsa Zsa. 
</P>
<P>
Well, almost. 
</P>
<P>
The late Jimi Hendrix failed to materialize at a rock guitar seance in 
Hollywood. The homeless march on Malibu didn't transpire despite Honorary Mayor 
Martin Sheen's invitation. And actor James Garner declined to run for governor, 
despite the urging of Democratic state Sen. Herschel Rosenthal, who said his 
party didn't have any exciting candidates. 
</P>
<P>
But there were so many memorable events that did materialize: A doggie ice 
cream made its debut in Hollywood, a Topanga group started the first nudist pen 
pal's club, lawyer Thomas White opened an office inside the Valencia Car Wash, 
and a snooty billiards parlor featuring valets and a no-smoking section was 
launched in West L.A. 
</P>
<P>
It was, perhaps above all else here, the Year of the Fax, with the machine's 
uses ranging from press releases and restaurant orders to wooing members of the 
opposite sex. West Hollywood business executive Anita Gittelson even received 
one assistant's resignation via a fax machine from Syracuse, N.Y. "It was a bit 
strange," Gittelson said. "In fact, it's strange that she was even in 
Syracuse." 
</P>
<P>
Pay-telephone lines also proliferated. An investigation of City Hall found 
$8,000 in worth of phone calls had been made to a dial-a-porn service with such 
offerings as "Call Me, I'm Michelle -- Live." 
</P>
<P>
Cultural life, as always, was active here. Long Beach held a skateboard art 
show, the Max Factor Museum in Hollywood was nominated for landmark status, and 
pianist Sandra Tsing Loh, backed by the Topanga Symphony Orchestra, serenaded 
the grunion on the beach at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
Alas, the rock group Poison, known for the hit album "Open Up and Say Ah," was 
forced to cancel a concert at the Sports Arena. The lead singer had bruised 
vocal chords. 
</P>
<P>
Inevitably, there were some bruised feelings too. 
</P>
<P>
L.A.'s new federal Metropolitan Detention Center surrendered its distinction as 
the world's first no-smoking prison after the inmates trashed their cells in a 
mass nicotine fit. (One problem: The ban hadn't applied to guards or other 
personnel.) 
</P>
<P>
Temple City officials objected to a quip by broadcaster Paul Harvey that an 
army of wire-eating ants who knocked out some traffic lights in the city had 
enjoyed a "power lunch." 
</P>
<P>
The Hell's Angels, contending that their ghoulish trademarks were used without 
their permission in the movie "Nam Angels" responded in full force. They sued. 
</P>
<P>
Physical fitness guru Jake Steinfeld took Cable News Network to court in L.A. 
over an underground tape allegedly produced by CNN employees that spliced 
segments of Steinfeld's fitness show with the purported sex tape of actor Rob 
Lowe. 
</P>
<P>
Southern California's most celebrated driver, Zsa Zsa Gabor, was convicted of 
slapping a Beverly Hills police officer who pulled over her Rolls-Royce. A 
Melrose Avenue eatery saluted her and a fellow defendant, New York hotel queen 
Leona Helmsley, with "Lobster Zsa Zsa" and "Lobster Leona" -- shellfish served 
with tiny handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, actress Jane Fonda and Assemblyman Tom Hayden agreed to divorce, 
prompting someone to quip that Fonda's next fitness tape could be titled: "It 
Didn't Work Out." 
</P>
<P>
In an effort to reduce courtroom tensions, an L.A. lawyer on the state Bar's 
Board of Governors proposed a "Code of Professional Courtesy" for attorneys 
including these vows: 
</P>
<P>
* "I will return telephone calls." 
</P>
<P>
* "I will not be late for court or for appointments." 
</P>
<P>
* "I will never take cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
Naturally, there was some fine print in the code: It would be voluntary. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the usual tensions were present on the roadways -- and even spilled 
over into the parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
Two chauffeurs exchanged gunfire after vying for the same spot outside a 
supermarket in Redondo Beach. Then there was the screenwriter who sued Clint 
Eastwood, claiming that the actor-director rammed her car after finding it 
parked in his space at Burbank Studios. Visitors to Ronald Reagan's offices in 
Century Building found to their surprise that he doesn't validate. 
</P>
<P>
Traffic was slower than ever. Some of the notable hindrances were a shipwreck 
on Culver Boulevard, a spill of 864,000 cans of vegetables on the San Gabriel 
River Freeway, a fallen load of catcher's masks on the Ventura, Rolling Stones 
ticket scalpers standing on the Harbor Freeway, 27,000 pounds of almond shells 
on the Foothill, a surfboard on the Artesia, and a body that fell out of a 
coroner's van on the Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
The roads could have been even more unsafe. But a woman who plowed into the 
wall of a Department of Motor Vehicles office in Glendale during her driver's 
test was denied a license. "We didn't even get to the parking part," her 
stunned examiner said later. 
</P>
<P>
There were other wrong turns too. 
</P>
<P>
Irwindale celebrated Mexico's Independence Day by flying Hungarian flags. TV 
Guide magazine placed Oprah Winfrey's head on Ann-Margret's body in a cover 
illustration. The Long Beach Unified School District advised students to avoid 
wearing Natas clothing because the name "spelled backward is Satan"; the notice 
was rescinded after it was learned that Natas is the first name of a famous 
skateboarder. 
</P>
<P>
After numerous parents' protests, a Paramount businessman halted the nationwide 
distribution of "Chilly Bang! Bang!" a pistol-shaped juice container imported 
from the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
One citywide disruption drew few protests from Banning High students in 
Wilmington. In the senior class poll, "Best School Activity" of the year was 
judged to be the L.A. teachers' strike. 
</P>
<P>
Pepperdine University students did some instructing themselves while visiting 
Germany. They scaled the Berlin Wall and taught the natives to do "The Wave" 
cheer. 
</P>
<P>
The L.A. City Council also drew some cheers when it voted in February to cut 
back the time that a member can speak on one issue from five minutes to three. 
In October, the council reinstated the five-minute limit. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, one County Board of Supervisors meeting dragged on so long that, at 
5 p.m., the county's security guards delivered a subtle message. They removed 
the metal detector at the entrance to the chamber and left. 
</P>
<P>
This year's Lincoln-Douglas Debate Award goes to Supervisors Pete Schabarum and 
Deane Dana for this angry exchange, which followed Dana's turnabout on one 
vote: 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum: "Some guy calls you up this morning and says, 'Holy cow, dabba dabba 
dabba dooo. . . .' " 
</P>
<P>
Dana: "Some people call up you and dabba dabba dooo." 
</P>
<P>
The debut of still another oldies' radio station plus innumerable 
retrospectives on the Beatles, Woodstock and other nostalgia led to the 
formation of a protest group, the National Assn. for the Advancement of Time 
(NAFTAT). Its slogan: "We want to end the 60s in your lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
OK, so maybe this is the right time to say goodby to the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
And, hello to the 70s! 
</P>
<P>
Dabba dabba dooo!

The deadly consequences of the Bay Area temblor shook the Southland, spurring 
fund-raising drives and a call for public measures to better prepare 
earthquake-prone Los Angeles for what scientists believe is the inevitable. As 
recently as last April, Los Angeles voters had rejected a $100-million bond 
issue that would have brought an estimated 15,000 brick buildings -- many of 
them in the city's poorest neighborhoods -- up to earthquake-safety standards. 
A similar measure will now be placed on next year's municipal ballot and city 
officials say they will push more strongly for its passage. Moreover, an 
earthquake-safety committee has been appointed by the Los Angeles City Council 
to identify additional unsound structures and find sources to finance their 
repair.

When his mother began to choke on a lozenge in their Van Nuys condominium, 
3-year-old Jameson Rodgers remembered what his parents had trained him to do. 
He dialed 911. "My mom's on the floor. She can't breathe," the tot told a Fire 
Department dispatcher in a calm, articulate voice. Minutes later, paramedics 
arrived and found Peggy Rodgers on her hands and knees, on the verge of 
unconsciousness. After two tries, they managed to dislodge the lozenge. Leonard 
Washington of Pomona reacted decisively when he noticed a group of black-booted 
"skinheads" accosting a Middle Eastern family in a La Verne parking lot. 
Washington, 34, stopped his car and proceeded to hold off the quartet of 
attackers, one of whom had menacingly waved a baseball bat, until police 
arrived. Nineteen other heroes received awards ranging from $250 to $10,388 
from the county Board of Supervisors for their roles in bringing Night Stalker 
Richard Ramirez to justice. "It was my biggest experience, to know that I 
confronted him face-to-face and knew that it was him," said Edgardo Molinar of 
Covina, who helped chase Ramirez through East Los Angeles on the day of his 
capture in August, 1985.

Four years after Southland residents were terrorized by a savage series of 
random attacks, Night Stalker Richard Ramirez was convicted of 13 counts of 
murder and sentenced to die in the gas chamber at San Quentin. The 
devil-worshiping drifter from El Paso delivered a chilling monologue before 
being escorted in chains from a Los Angeles courtroom for the last time. "I am 
beyond good and evil," he declared. "I will be avenged." Also sentenced to 
death was Randy Kraft, a Long Beach computer consultant convicted of murdering 
16 young men in Orange County and suspected of 50 more killings, several of 
them in Los Angeles County. Southwest Los Angeles street gang member Durrell 
DeWitt Collins received a term of 27 years to life in state prison for the 1988 
Westwood stray bullet shooting death of Long Beach graphic artist Karen 
Toshima. The slaying, having taken place in one of the city's few fashionable, 
pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods, stunned Los Angeles and brought the problem 
of gang violence to center stage. Another South Los Angeles resident was 
ordered by a federal judge to spend the rest of his life in prison without 
parole for possession of 4.4 ounces of crack cocaine. Richard V. Winrow, 22, 
was the second person in the nation to be sentenced under a new federal 
narcotics-trafficking statute that provides for vastly stiffer sentences 
whenever defendants have two or more prior drug offenses. The year also saw the 
first overturned conviction resulting from an ongoing scandal involving 
jailhouse informants. A judge ruled that a Montebello man serving a life 
sentence for murder, was entitled to a new trial. The ruling came after the 
district attorney's office admitted it had failed to disclose knowledge that 
informant Stephen Jesse Cisneros, a convicted rapist who testified against 
Vargas, was an inveterate liar.

When Lucille Ball's heart gave out, Americans responded with a flood of 
heartfelt emotion normally reserved for only the most intimate of friends. In a 
sense, the pumpkin-haired co-creator and star of "I Love Lucy" was just that. 
Durning the Golden Age of TV, she turned up weekly in the living rooms of 40 
million viewers. In reruns, she is bound to continue entertaining well into the 
21st Century. Perhaps President Bush summed it up best. The whole world, he 
declared, loved Lucy. Overall, the year took a heavy toll on Hollywood. Others 
who died included actors Bette Davis and Lord Laurence Olivier; Man of 1,000 
Voices Mel Blanc, and songwriters Irving Berlin ("God Bless America," "White 
Christmas"), Johnny Green ("Body and Soul"), Sammy Fain ("Love Is a Many 
Splendored Thing") and Sammy Lerner ("I'm Popeye the Sailor Man"). Oh yes, 
another major Los Angeles voice was lost in 1989. The feisty Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner expired as a result of dwindling circulation and ad revenues, leaving 
the city with only one regional newspaper. Other notable passings: local TV 
news ace Bill Stout, former Roman Catholic archdiocese leader Cardinal Timothy 
Manning, boxing great Sugar Ray Robinson, innovative dance troupe founder Alvin 
Ailey and the Pan Pacific Auditorium. The latter, Los Angeles' primary example 
of the Streamline Moderne architectural style of the 1930s, was destroyed in a 
suspicious fire.

CRIME CHASE LEADS OFFICER TO LIFE-SAVING RENDEZVOUS

It looked like a kidnaping. It turned out to be a kid saving. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles police officer Jim Tomer expected to nab some bad guys. Instead, he 
was being credited Saturday with saving a 17-month-old boy who had suffered 
convulsions and stopped breathing. 
</P>
<P>
The child, Michael Roman, was reported in stable condition Saturday at 
Childrens Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Tomer and his partner, Steve Razo, spotted trouble shortly after noon -- a car 
filled with people and commotion racing down Cahuenga Boulevard in Hollywood. 
The officers chased the vehicle as it ran a red light and swung onto Hollywood 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"There were three or four adults in the car. There was a lot of moving around. 
They (the officers) thought it might be a kidnaping," said Hollywood Division 
Sgt. Robert Plassmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
But when the car stopped in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard, relatives of the 
infant jumped out yelling, "My baby! My baby!" Plassmeyer said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomer ran to the car and found the unconscious child on the back seat. The 
officer lifted the child onto his hand and administered a Heimlich-like 
procedure, patting its back and pushing up on its stomach. The child vomited, 
gurgled and began breathing again. 
</P>
<P>
The child's aunt, Wendy Ruiz, said in a telephone interview Saturday that 
another aunt and uncle were baby-sitting Michael, who lives in Hollywood with 
his mother, Juana Hernandez. Several relatives were on their way to a local 
bank with the child when the boy suddenly became seriously ill, she said. "He 
turned really pale," she said. "And then stopped breathing." 
</P>
<P>
One relative tried to revive the boy with cardiopulmonary resuscitation while 
the driver raced for the hospital, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Plassmeyer said the child had been running a fever and been given an aspirin 
product shortly before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The boy's mother, a department store sales clerk, was notified shortly after 
the incident and rushed to the hospital, Ruiz said. 
</P>
<P>
Tomer could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
After reviving Michael, Tomer was sent off Saturday afternoon to handle a 
report of a body being found. "You save one life and another one goes," 
Plassmeyer said.

CHANGES, CUTBACKS ALLOW SAN PEDRO HOSPITAL TO CUT ITS DEFICIT; 
</P>
<P>
MEDICINE: 'TURNAROUND HAS COME,' PRESIDENT ASSERTS. CRITICS SAY THE WORST OF 
THE FISCAL CRISIS MAY BE OVER. 
</P>

<P>
The financially ailing San Pedro Peninsula Hospital appears to be well on the 
way to healing itself. 
</P>
<P>
The community hospital was saddled with accumulated losses of $9 million 
earlier in the year, but is expected to end 1989 having cut that deficit to no 
more than $1.5 million. The year's budget was $95 million. 
</P>
<P>
The change in the financial picture has come about through a number of efforts: 
Employees were laid off. Some costly or money-losing programs -- such as 
inpatient psychiatry and the residence training of family-practice physicians 
-- were cut. Services that are likely to bring in more business -- such as a 
cardiovascular surgery center and a state-of-the-art obstetrics unit -- are 
being created or expanded. 
</P>
<P>
Although the precise end-of-year deficit won't be known until an official audit 
is done in March, "the turnaround has come," hospital President John Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Larry Orosz, board chairman and hospital emergency room chief, agreed. 
"We've come a long way in the last seven or eight months," he said. He said he 
is unhappy that the hospital is ending the year still in the red, "but you 
can't do things overnight." 
</P>
<P>
Two staff physicians once critical of the hospital's management, Dr. Philip 
Geller and Dr. Phillip Schoenwetter, said they believe -- if somewhat guardedly 
-- that the hospital is putting its past behind it. 
</P>
<P>
"We're a long way from being out of the woods, but we're doing better," Geller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"They're doing the best they can," Schoenwetter observed. 
</P>
<P>
Pointing to changes that include placing staff physicians on board committees 
and improving communications with the public, hospital leaders say a feeling of 
teamwork and openness has come to the facility, which earlier this year was 
alive with discontent. 
</P>
<P>
After recording the first financial losses in its history, the 64-year-old 
hospital in January replaced its president with Wilson and brought in the 
national accounting firm of Ernst &amp; Whinney (now Ernst &amp; Young) to 
develop a plan to get the hospital out of the red. 
</P>
<P>
Some staff physicians and other employees faulted the board for not recognizing 
and solving the financial and operational problems as they developed, 
questioning whether the board was capable of running the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
"We were concerned that if the board could not see the facts of life, what else 
were they missing," Schoenwetter said. 
</P>
<P>
The hospital's well-publicized troubles became San Pedro's equivalent of a TV 
soap opera during the first few months of the year. Critics charged that a few 
entrenched physicians with lucrative service contracts controlled the hospital, 
asserting that it could be facing bankruptcy or a takeover by a for-profit 
chain. 
</P>
<P>
Although the hospital leadership contended it already was acting to solve the 
financial problems, dissident members of the community corporation that owns 
the hospital and elects the board succeeded in forcing a special corporate 
meeting in March. 
</P>
<P>
Although the dissidents failed to replace the 15-member hospital board, Geller 
and Schoenwetter believe they were a catalyst the hospital needed. Geller said 
putting a public spotlight on the board made it "move faster than it might have 
ordinarily." 
</P>
<P>
So far, the financial turnaround has come largely through personnel and service 
cuts recommended by Ernst &amp; Whinney, which concluded that the hospital was 
mismanaged, overstaffed and lacked strong services that would attract patients 
and allow it to fend off competition from other hospitals. Several departments 
were consolidated, 129 people were laid off and a flexible staffing system was 
established to allow the hospital to maintain a daily staff level based on 
patient volume. 
</P>
<P>
With public and private insurers tightening up on reimbursements and demanding 
less hospitalization and more outpatient care, "a smaller, mobile force is the 
way you have to do it," Schoenwetter said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to calling for cuts, Ernst &amp; Whinney also said that San Pedro 
had to strengthen itself as a community hospital by upgrading key services and 
moving toward specialties such as cardiac surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Bruce Goldreyer, who is chief of staff, said the way to get more physicians 
to use a hospital is to "provide them with the facilities that they need." 
</P>
<P>
The hospital will spend $2.5 million to upgrade maternity care with what Wilson 
called a "state-of-the-art" obstetrics center. It will be financed through the 
sale of excess hospital property. 
</P>
<P>
In a $1.5-million program, the hospital will open a cardiovascular surgery 
center in October. Ernst &amp; Whinney concluded that this service could add $1 
million a year to hospital profits, according to officials. 
</P>
<P>
Responding to the trend toward outpatient care, San Pedro Hospital in January 
will open a 15-bed ambulatory center for short-stay surgical procedures. The 
hospital has been providing this outpatient service, but it will be able to 
accommodate nearly twice as many patients in a more comfortable setting, 
Goldreyer said. 
</P>
<P>
A 24-hour industrial accident center has been opened next to the emergency 
room. Orosz said it should appeal to employers "because they can be assured 
care always will be available." 
</P>
<P>
Newspaper advertising and direct mail -- concentrated on San Pedro, the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula, Harbor City and Lomita -- are being used to attract more 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
In April, the hospital will present a one-year progress report to community 
corporation members. 
</P>
<P>
Although hospital leaders say they have parted the sea of red ink without 
reducing quality, Geller and Schoenwetter contend that recovery has had a 
price, including morale problems stemming from the loss of staff. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a transition time," Schoenwetter said. "There are insecurities on the 
part of the staff and physical disruptions as new facilities are being put in 
and renovations are going on." 
</P>
<P>
For his part, Wilson said he believes the success of this year's hospital 
fund-raising drive amounts to a vote of confidence. More than $3 million, 
including a single $1-million gift from an anonymous benefactor, was raised by 
the hospital foundation. Last year, the total was $863,000. He said months of 
adverse publicity might have been expected to dampen the drive. Instead, he 
said, the hospital had "its biggest year ever."

"Would you mind taking your shoes off?" Eugene Fodor inquires of a visitor 
ushered into the violinist's Upper West Side Manhattan apartment. "I have a 
white rug." 
</P>
<P>
He is relaxed and looks remarkably fit in black jeans, a Western silver belt 
and T-shirt, despite a wide-open window to the 27-degree temperature outside. 
At 39, he could easily pass for at least 10 years younger. 
</P>
<P>
He is ready to talk about events leading up to his arrest on July 27 in a 
vacant hotel room on Martha's Vineyard when he was charged with breaking and 
entering and possession of a controlled substance, cocaine. He says he had 
money to pay for the room, but because it was late at night with no hotel clerk 
on duty and desperately needing to "crash," he broke in. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor is luckier than most. A Massachusetts court dropped the drug charge, 
citing him only for trespassing, a misdemeanor, on condition he enter a drug 
rehabilitation program. He did, and his slate is clean. 
</P>
<P>
His situation is a far cry from what it was in 1974 when he returned from 
Moscow after winning the silver medal (actually a tie with two other 
contestants) in the International Tchaikovsky Competition. The gold medal was 
not awarded, so it could be said in truth no one bested him. 
</P>
<P>
Before that, he had won first prize in the International Paganini, the 
Merriwether Post and the Young Musicians Foundation of Los Angeles 
competitions, after study with Jascha Heifetz, Joseph Szigeti and Josef 
Gingold, among others. 
</P>
<P>
While his win didn't place him in the same league with Van Cliburn's triumph in 
Moscow, Fodor still was something of a hero and was met at the Denver airport 
(Turkey Creek, Colo., was his home) by his parents, his girlfriend and his 
horse. He took to posing in jeans with his shirt open to the waist. 
</P>
<P>
The media loved it. He was dubbed the "Cowboy Violinist," and made the 
television national newscasts, going on to appear on "The Tonight Show" (14 
times) and play at the White House. He signed a contract with RCA Records. Most 
of the major American orchestras and concert series wanted him. He was a Golden 
Boy, but many serious musicians and critics were irritated. He admits the image 
may have hurt him, and says he tried to shed it, but, "I guess it's (fouled 
up)." 
</P>
<P>
As time went on, however, and he was not so young anymore, the aura of success 
began to fade. He made the somewhat naive discovery that the music business was 
not an altruistic one, but one dominated, he says, by an exclusive troika of 
conductors, orchestra and artist managers. Disillusioned, he became 
increasingly frustrated and unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
His reputation in the business then: He was not maturing as an artist, and was 
only interested in the virtuoso display pieces of such as Paganini and 
Sarasate, not the great repertory works of Beethoven, Brahms or Sibelius. Fodor 
insists that he had these big works under his belt, and indeed played them, but 
that the stories were an excuse by his manager, Harold Shaw, of his own 
"mismanagement and greed." 
</P>
<P>
The violinist claims he preferred to do smaller festivals for less money, which 
would give him an opportunity to grow and explore other repertory, but that 
Shaw was interested in dollars and cents. 
</P>
<P>
"When I first appeared on the Great Performers Series at Lincoln Center in 
1974, his coercion bordered on rage that I played the virtuoso stuff and not 
the Bach, Prokofiev and Beethoven I wanted. I tried to get out of my contract 
three years before it was up, but he wouldn't let me go." 
</P>
<P>
Shaw, who was Fodor's manager for eight years, would not accept phone calls. He 
stated through a spokeswoman that he would have no comment on Fodor. 
</P>
<P>
Fodor also contends that the horse-at-the-airport idea was that of the 
publicity firm hired by Shaw, Gurtman &amp; Murtha. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't remember whose idea the horse was," James Murtha commented, "but let's 
face it, Eugene was a cowboy and liked to show it off. He would come to an 
interview in cowboy shirt, Levi's and boots. And he was quick to pull out 
pictures of his horse. We tried to counter the image with appearances at 
conservative festivals like Caramoor (where) we would have no press if it 
weren't for that image. If he were just a regular classical artist they 
wouldn't have cared less. Also, there was some resentment when we said he won 
top prize at the Tchaikovsky, which he did, but technically it was a tie for 
second. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole thing is very unfortunate. The concert business in America is dying 
today. Only about 10% of the audience are committed serious music lovers. When 
once a university would have 60 events a season, now they have only six, and 
among those they want pop attractions. 
</P>
<P>
"Eugene could have bridged the gap had he expanded his repertory. He still 
could bring people in, and if they liked him, they just might be curious enough 
to go, say, to the Cleveland Orchestra for a concert, even without a soloist." 
</P>
<P>
Fodor maintains he was not suffering burnout, that his love of music was a deep 
and renewing experience and always had been. Because of politics, he says, many 
good people are ignored. Since 1982, he has been managed by Vincent Wagner of 
the Hillyer International Agency. 
</P>
<P>
As for his recording career, after four years and six records Fodor was dropped 
by RCA. That this happened was not entirely Fodor's fault. Since RCA had struck 
gold with Van Cliburn, RCA over the years often signed up the latest boy wonder 
or contest winner, and when the Cliburn lightening did not strike Fodor, the 
record label let him go. Efforts to reach RCA officials over the holidays were 
unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime Fodor's personal life was being affected. He was divorced from 
his wife, a former Denver resident who now lives in Washington with their three 
children, a boy, 5, and two girls, 8 and 9. In February of this year Fodor said 
that he began to experiment with cocaine on social occasions but that the habit 
soon escalated. What about heroin? "I don't remember if I tried it. It was 
mostly other drugs, but chiefly cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
His friends began to notice a physical change, particularly weight loss. One 
who hadn't seen him in a number of months was shocked at his skeletal 
appearance. Fodor knew he was in trouble, and tried to get help. He even went 
to a few meetings of a rehabilitation program, but as he puts it, "I couldn't 
get a grip on myself." 
</P>
<P>
"The day I was arrested, I never felt so alone in my life. I called both my 
parents, and while they knew I had a problem, they both were shocked. We 
believed in discipline at home, particularly my father." He has not tried to 
blame them for anything, and says he bears no resentment. 
</P>
<P>
His mother, Antoinette Fodor, says she and her husband, Eugene Fodor Sr., 
visited their son a month before the arrest and were distressed by his 
appearance. They knew something was wrong but had no idea it might involve 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
She reminisces with some pride: "When he was little, he begged for the violin 
when he saw his older brother John playing. We didn't know it then, but he had 
a genius IQ. He was an overactive child. By the time he was 11 or 12 he told us 
he was going to be a star. Of course the discipline was more than ordinary, it 
had to be. The worst punishment we could give him for not practicing was to 
take the violin away from him. After a while, he would practice five or six 
hours a day without being told to. 
</P>
<P>
"We tried to even things out with recreation. He learned to scuba dive and took 
boxing lessons, since the other kids taunted him about being a sissy. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't see each other too often but we keep in touch by telephone. When he 
was arrested we didn't come back to see him because that was a lot to spend for 
airfare, but he knew we supported him." 
</P>
<P>
The musician entered what he prefers to call a "recovery program" at Conifer 
Park Facility near Schenectady, N.Y., which offers a 12-step plan described as 
a "lifetime process" based not on a religious (he says he has no religion) but 
a spiritual way of life, "a fellowship of humanity and caring, which is the 
most profound I've ever witnessed." 
</P>
<P>
"I was at the facility for 28 days. I attended 90 meetings after I got out. Now 
I go a couple of times a week. Only last night I spoke at one. Our experiences 
give strength and hope. We have telephone therapy all the time, discussing 
getting better. You stay clean one day at a time. It is an open-ended 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm living a completely normal life now, and the desire to use cocaine has 
been lifted. If I saw drugs being used at a party, I would probably object to 
it and leave." 
</P>
<P>
He has a girlfriend who, he says, has been very supportive. He has no plans for 
marriage at this time. 
</P>
<P>
The music business has been supportive of him, and no engagements have been 
canceled because of his arrest. His first concert was in Peekskill, N.Y., and 
he played 11 other dates since he left Conifer Park, the most important of 
which was a solo recital without even an accompanist on Martha's Vineyard. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted to face my demons there," he explains. "When I was arrested I was 
treated with utmost dignity. The audience gave me strength, and I wanted to 
give something back in gratitude for the clean life I have now. The proceeds of 
that night went to a drug rehab program on the island. 
</P>
<P>
"I've appeared at a couple of schools in Texas on behalf of rehab, and when I 
do one of my artist-in-residence appearances, I always speak for the last 10 
minutes on the dangers of drugs." 
</P>
<P>
His manager, Wagner, admits there were problems after the arrest. "Of course it 
was a detriment for a while. People were not sure of his availability because 
of the mandatory drug sentencing laws in Massachusetts. Since a wire service 
story, which was positive, however, and the '20/20' television program (Dec. 
15), things have begun to break, really in the last few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
"Eugene always wanted to play the big pieces, and we try for him, but when 
someone like Riccardo Muti asks for the Paganini, as he did a couple of years 
ago, you do it. At that same time he performed the Beethoven with the Beethoven 
Society in Carnegie Hall, but he wasn't even reviewed. He played Mozart with 
Lukas Foss and the Brooklyn Philharmonic, and it was beautiful. I think some 
people are envious that he could do the virtuoso pieces so easily, and that's 
why stories go around. His fee has remained consistent the last few years, in 
the $7,000-$10,000 category." 
</P>
<P>
Fodor speaks of the future. "I have orchestral dates with the Warsaw 
Philharmonic and one in Sofia, a festival in Switzerland and concerts in 
England and France. In the States, I have orchestra dates in Phoenix, Denver, 
Sioux City, Burlington, Vt., and others I don't want to comment on until 
contracts are signed. There have even been some nibbles from recording firms. 
</P>
<P>
"I lift weights, ride my bicycle and am otherwise physically back to normal. 
And I'll tell you one thing, I'm not afraid."

DID THIS MAN INVENT THE MODERN RESTAURANT?;

MICHAEL MCCARTY ASSESSES HIS PLACE IN RESTAURANT HISTORY;

<TEXT>
<P>
Michael McCarty is not a modest man. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a pioneer, there's no question about it. I clearly think that in 1979, 
Michael's restaurant defined what restaurants were," he said as he surveyed his 
brand new restaurant last month in New York. 
</P>
<P>
Even before he opened Michael's in Santa Monica (at the ripe old age of 24), 
humility was not exactly his strong suit. "We're doing something different 
here," he said as he prepared his menu in 1979. "My specials are going to blow 
your socks off." 
</P>
<P>
And they did. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty's brash charm blew into the Los Angeles restaurant scene like a 
whirlwind. He filled his kitchen with long-haired young Americans (the old man 
of the group was 28) who were wonderful chefs -- and whose arrogance matched 
his own. When asked about his formal training, head chef Ken Frank said airly, 
"I didn't have any. I just worked my way up from being a dishwasher. But that, 
of course, was in France. You know -- in 6 months in France you learn to be a 
chef in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
These were the first heady days of what was to be called California Cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
This is what the critics said: "Wow" (The Times). "Michael's needs a mother" 
(New West). "There's a lot of style going on at Michael's" (Herald Examiner). 
"Haughtiness is served as the appetizer" (Los Angeles Magazine). 
</P>
<P>
If the critics didn't quite understand that McCarty wanted to do what he called 
"the weirdest things," it's no wonder. McCarty himself described his food as 
"the best possible ingredients I could buy cooked in the simplest possible 
way." But in reality it was nothing more than nouvelle cuisine -- served up in 
a nouvelle ambiance. 
</P>
<P>
"Remember," says McCarty now, "when we opened up, nobody used those big white 
plates? All the other Villeroy and Boch plates had the baskets on them so the 
plate looked really busy. I had to go to Germany to get that stripped off." He 
smiles thinking about it. "Hey, remember how much heat we took for the lights 
being on in Santa Monica? Everybody said it was so bright. Remember how shocked 
people were by the music? Contemporary jazz in a restaurant? Remember that? 
Remember the concept of the indoor-outdoor -- how many people were amazed that 
we had a patio in those days?" He looks around his own new restaurant smugly 
surveying the collection of very good art displayed on the walls. "I mean, how 
many restaurants now put art on the walls? And big flowers?" 
</P>
<P>
Actually, McCarty didn't start with big flowers. He didn't start with flowers 
at all. On opening night, one well-wisher walked into the Santa Monica 
restaurant with a bouquet and McCarty blanched, punched her lightly in the 
stomach and said, "Could you divide those into vases and put them on the 
tables?" But no matter -- McCarty is convinced that he virtually invented a new 
look for restaurants. He gazes around his new room with satisfaction and says, 
"This kind of lighting, this kind of wall and this kind of art have become a de 
rigeur design throughout the country for a modern new restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
McCarty likes it all so much that he has virtually reproduced the original 
restaurant in New York. The walls look the same, the art looks the same, the 
chairs are the same, bright lights, modern music. There's even a patio out in 
back. And the menu is the same as the one in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
McCarty would like you to think it is the same menu that he served 10 years 
ago. "It's interesting," he says. "The food that I created in those days was 
simply what we have today." 
</P>
<P>
It isn't. The original menu was written in French and contained relics like a 
fish terrine (borrowed from the menu at L'Ermitage), raw scallops in pureed 
beets (borrowed from Pierre Vedel), the ubiquitous feuilletages filled with 
fish and topped with beurre blanc, and Grand Marnier souffles (then found on 
virtually every menu with a claim to nouvelle cuisine). By contrast, the 
current menu is written in almost tedious English ("spaghettini with Chesapeake 
Bay Scallops and Sacramento River Delta Crayfish, Chardonnay Cream sauce, 
roasted red and yellow peppers, baby asparagus and Lake Superior Golden 
Caviar"). It's just a way of telling you that the current Michael's menu takes 
the most expensive products available -- no matter where they come from -- and 
puts them together on the plate. These days there are a lot more ingredients 
than there used to be, but it's what Jonathan Waxman, who was Michael's head 
chef for four years (before taking California Cuisine to New York at his wildly 
popular Jams) once called "air freight cuisine." 
</P>
<P>
It is a perfect description. In a way, Michael's food is the antithesis of 
California Cuisine as practiced by Alice Waters and her disciples; they believe 
in site-specific cooking and practice the gospel of freshness. But this is the 
ideal food for a man who likes what he serves so well that he wants to serve it 
everywhere. For while many modern restaurants proudly rely on local products, 
McCarty proudly relies on local delivery. 
</P>
<P>
Did McCarty create the cuisine? Absolutely, he says. Absolutely not, say chefs 
who have worked with him. "He pretty much left the kitchen alone," says one 
chef who worked at the restaurant for more than a year (and who does not want 
to be identified). "Even the famous Chardonnay cream sauce was actually 
invented by Jonathan Waxman. When Michael McCarty was in the kitchen it was 
because it was the shortest distance between the two dining rooms." The same 
chef admits, however, that McCarty created an atmosphere that fostered 
creativity. 
</P>
<P>
He certainly got a lot of press for the new kind of cooking. "He is," says Ken 
Frank today, "a great marketer and a brilliant businessman." 
</P>
<P>
Which McCarty himself would not deny. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to understand," he said when he opened in 1979, "I'm a 
wheeler-dealer. It's all a matter of juggling time and money." Today, he says, 
things have changed. "The good old days of Mike's restaurant where I borrowed 
$250,000 and paid it off in a year and a half, they don't exist anymore." 
</P>
<P>
These days, McCarty is working for bigger stakes. He says with some pride that 
the payroll for his four restaurants -- two Michaels and two Adirondacks ("the 
one in D.C. is one of my more successful restaurants, but Denver is a pain") is 
$4 million. "We'll do $12 million next year in sales. We buy $3 1/2 million 
worth of food every year. I pay principal and interest to banks on the money 
that I've borrowed of $1.25 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
"The reason why chefs go in and out of business all the time is because most of 
them open up restaurants and just can't figure out where the money goes. 
Because this is the biggest nickel-and-dime business you've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
Most restaurateurs get their nickels and dimes from partnerships. Not McCarty. 
"I'm not like those nice little chefs who have rich parents. And I don't deal 
well with partners. I borrowed my money from the bank, and I work every day at 
securing and maintaining those credit lines." 
</P>
<P>
At the moment he needs more credit than ever. For McCarty says this is his last 
restaurant: He has bigger fish to fry. He plans to move on to hotels. "What 
Michael's restaurant did for the restaurant industry, my hotel will do for the 
hotel industry." 
</P>
<P>
What McCarty has in mind is a sort of Bel Air at the Beach on the site of the 
Sand and Sea Club in Santa Monica. "People have a definition of what a great 
hotel is, and it's a Four Seasons or a Regent or a Ritz Carlton. By no means 
are they bad hotels, but they are chains. I plan to do things the old way -- 
yet very modernized." He plans great art, great architecture, great food -- and 
all the best people. But it's all a few years off. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he's got a hit on his hands in New York. The new Michael's has all 
the buzz that the first Michael's had in Santa Monica when it opened. 
Reservations are hard to get, the location is great and beautiful people come 
pouring through the door. The critics have been kind. In New York, they are 
saying that McCarty has come to town to show them how things are done in 
California. McCarty isn't interested. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not coming to town to show anybody anything. I'm coming to town to have a 
successful business. I'm too old to pioneer anymore." 
</P>

THE REVIEW

<P>
"If it's not within four blocks of 55th and 6th, forget it. That's what I said 
when I was looking for a location. And I was right; just look at this crowd!" 
</P>
<P>
Michael McCarty is pleased. He's got all the right people. 
</P>
<P>
"Look over there," he points. "There's a guy, I would say, we've been open 10 
days, he's eaten here nine times. He loves his little green salad. This is a 
guy who's going to be eating here all the time." Michael bounces down his 
stairs, his ebullience infectious. 
</P>
<P>
"After all these years of putting waiters in Polo shirts, where do we land? 
Next door to the headquarters of Ralph Lauren. It's great -- they come in, they 
book four, five tables a night, and they drink like mad at the bar. This is a 
fashion street . . . " He opens his hand, ticks off on his fingers. "Perry 
Ellis, Manolo Blahnik. And the museum's right here too, and 57th Street, with 
all the galleries. It's good for me." 
</P>
<P>
And, judging by the crowd, good for them. 
</P>
<P>
Michael's is a pleasant place to be. He is making the sort of food that is easy 
to eat and serving it in a room that is easy to be in. The waiters all look 
like surfers, but the service is surprisingly smooth. And after all these years 
Michael's menu has calmed down to a pleasant pace; if there is nothing here you 
haven't had before, there is nothing here you wouldn't be happy to eat. 
</P>
<P>
This is the same menu as the one at Michael's in Santa Monica -- but at a lower 
cost. (Actually, just last month Michael lowered his prices by a third in Santa 
Monica as well.) The oysters are wonderful -- served with fine walnut bread. 
Salads have a lot of ingredients -- three kinds of mushrooms, herbs, garlic and 
pancetta on baby greens is one example -- but they work. Even a simple salad of 
red leaf and limestone lettuce comes out looking like a little flower with 
diced tomatoes at the heart. Soups tend to be a little too creamy for those who 
are no longer acquainted with cholesterol, but they taste fine. 
</P>
<P>
My main quarrel with the main courses is the vegetables. It's hard to find 
fault with a well-aged steak served with the now-famous Mor-Ida frozen French 
fries and a little sprig of watercress. You delight in that fine squab with 
foie gras, and find that you don't even mind the raspberry sauce. Sweetbreads 
really are crisply cooked, and the caper, lemon and parsley that comes with 
them is understandably classic. The kitchen does nice things with fish. The 
chicken is always reliable. But the vegetables have almost no flavor, and are 
so fussily arranged that they're cold by the time they reach you. You can't 
help wondering if they have been sitting on the plate all day. It's a little 
like eating a dinosaur; doesn't Michael know there's been a vegetable 
revolution? 
</P>
<P>
I'm not crazy about the desserts either. More dinosaurs. Desserts have evolved 
over the years until they have become one of the more interesting courses in 
really good restaurants, but Michael's still serving all those tarts and tortes 
and mousse cake things. I invariably find myself ordering the dessert called 
"les 5 sorbets et les 8 cookies" -- and feeling rather silly. 
</P>
<P>
But then I look around and notice that Michael is the only other person in the 
room who is ending his meal with a sweet. The room is filled with fashion folk 
-- and they definitely don't do dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael's, 24 West 55th St., New York. (212) 767-0055. Open for lunch 
Monday-Friday, for dinner nightly, brunch Saturday and Sunday. Full bar. All 
major credit cards accepted. Dinner for two, food only, $80-$120.

CALIFORNIA LETTERS;

LOTUS LAND OR LOCUST LAND?

<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID M. FINE, Fine, editor of Los Angeles in Fiction and Unknown 
California, is professor of English at Cal State Long Beach.

<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty years ago two slim novels appeared that put Los Angeles on the national 
literary map. Nathanael West's savage portrait of Hollywood, "The Day of the 
Locust," and the first of Raymond Chandler's seven hard-boiled L.A. detective 
stories, "The Big Sleep," appeared within months of each other in 1939. 
Chandler's achievement was to adapt the crime novel to the peculiar geographic 
and psychic terrain of Los Angeles. West's achievement, the larger one, was to 
transform and deepen the long-established but still crude Hollywood novel. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1930s, when the talkies were invented, studio heads were scouring the 
East Coast (and Europe) for writers who could construct dialogue -- as they 
were for actors who could speak it. Nathanael West, one of the eager recruits, 
made the first of his two sojourns to Hollywood in July of 1933. 
</P>
<P>
A shy, lonely New Yorker ironically nicknamed "Pep," West had at the time two 
books behind him, both commercial failures. He had been working as a night 
manager in a Manhattan hotel owned by his father when "Miss Lonelyhearts," his 
second novel, was purchased by Darryl F. Zanuck. Hired to do the screenplay, 
West boarded a train for the coast, hoping to earn enough money in Hollywood to 
enable him to continue as a novelist. 
</P>
<P>
His brother-in-law, the humorist S. J. Perelman, was already in Hollywood, 
having scripted the brilliant dialogue for the Marx brothers' films "Monkey 
Business" and "Horse Feathers." West's first Hollywood encounter ended before 
the year was up. His screenplay never materialized, and the novel was assigned 
to a team of hacks who managed, alchemically, to transmute a brilliant gem into 
a piece of innocuous fluff. When the picture, renamed "Advice to the Lovelorn," 
opened, the disheartened "Pep" West was on a train heading back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
In 1935, he was back in Hollywood working as a salaried writer for Republic 
("Repulsive," as it was called by the writers) Studios, scripting B movies, 
living in the tawdry Pa-Va-Sed apartment house on North Ivar Street and storing 
up the material for the Hollywood novel he had been thinking about. His Ivar 
Street neighbors were an assortment of Hollywood discards: has-been comics, bit 
players, stunt men and prostitutes. 
</P>
<P>
One night he came home and saw a prostitute kick what appeared to be a bundle 
of laundry in the corridor. The bundle moved and a midget emerged from it. The 
incident found its way into the beginning of the novel. The surreal ambience of 
"The Day of the Locust," the grotesque "half world" of Hollywood outcasts and 
hangers-on West painted, was grounded in observed reality. 
</P>
<P>
West never harbored the illusion that what he did at the studio had anything to 
do with art. Nor, he discovered, was the hack work to which he was assigned 
easy. He wrote in a letter that "this stuff about easy work is all wrong. . . . 
There's no fooling here. All the writers sit in cells in a row, and the minute 
the typewriter stops someone pokes his head in to see if you are still 
thinking." 
</P>
<P>
West separated the two realms, working days in the "dream factory" and nights 
on his novel. It was completed in 1938 and published in 1939. Despite the 
praise of friends like F. Scott Fitzgerald and Dashiell Hammett, the book sold 
exactly 1,464 copies. A year after its publication, West was killed along with 
his wife (Eileen McKenney, of Ruth McKenney's "My Sister Eileen") when his car 
ran a stop sign in the Imperial Valley and struck another car. He was 37. 
</P>
<P>
The Hollywood that West constructed out of the materials of observation, 
experience, and imagination was the symbolic center of an entire culture 
cheated and robbed by the puerile fantasies of the dream factory. He said in an 
earlier work on Hollywood that "everything that is wrong with the United States 
is to be found there in rare purity." Hollywood was source and symptom of a 
malady that was more than local. The novel is the severest literary indictment 
of the Hollywood dream we have and the most far-reaching in its implications 
for American culture. More relentlessly than other writers who were mining the 
materials of Hollywood for fiction, West traced the tangled connections between 
the fantasies produced by the studios and the fantasies so desperately pursued 
by the masses of dream seekers. 
</P>
<P>
The landscape of West's novel is littered with illusion. Whole neighborhoods 
resemble movie sets, look like leftover props from completed or abandoned 
movies. The studio back lot is the "dream dump," the "Sargasso of the 
imagination." Beyond the studio walls the city appears as a vast annex to the 
lots. It's as though the sets had spilled over onto the surrounding landscape. 
Tod Hackett, West's spokesman, climbs to his apartment in the Hollywood Hills 
past a melange of "Mexican ranch houses, Samoan huts, Mediterranean villas, 
Egyptian and Japanese temples, Swiss chalets, Tudor cottages, and every 
possible combination of these styles that lined the slopes of the canyon." 
</P>
<P>
In this movie-like landscape, West's characters act out their roles. Teen-age 
would-be starlet Fay Greener, dreaming of fame and glamour, shuffles her deck 
of dream cards and draws a different role daily, playing everything from 
Daddy's girl in a white sailor suit to tough whore. Meanwhile, her father, 
Harry Greener, ex-vaudeville performer, tap-dances his way to exhaustion, 
collapses, fakes his own heart attack and then dies from it. 
</P>
<P>
The line here between living and acting has disappeared. Life has been reduced 
to a series of roles. One becomes what one pretends to be. All the world is a 
sound stage. Even the natural landscape is rendered in terms of a movie set. 
The setting sun against the edge of trees appears like the "violet piping" of a 
neon tube. The moon puts in a cameo appearance as a "bone button" poking 
through a "blue serge sky." The organic world has been preempted, upstaged, by 
the inorganic. Nature is the work of well-placed props, technical skill, and 
effective lighting. 
</P>
<P>
But illusion breeds disillusion, and disillusion breeds violence. While the 
performers play out their roles, all those tired, jaded Midwesterners who "had 
come to California to die" stare with resentment and burn with rage. They are 
the cheated, the ones who have been fed on the dream and find that oranges and 
sunshine are not enough to satisfy their palates. They are the ones who hang 
out at airports hoping to see a plane crash and attend the funerals of 
strangers hoping to witness some extraordinary display of grief. 
</P>
<P>
When Hollywood dreams fail to materialize, a feeling of betrayal sets in, and 
with it the kind of fury that erupts in the orgiastic mob violence that brings 
the novel to a screaming halt. The thousands of bit players, those without 
speaking parts, the locusts of the title, become, in the final reel, the 
leading performers, tearing the Hollywood props down. It is one of the most 
devastating last scenes in American fiction. If the American Dream is ever shut 
down the way the Soviet Utopia recently has been shut down in Eastern Europe, 
Nathanael West may turn out to have written the script. 
</P>
<P>
Like Chandler but more profoundly than Chandler, West gave us a way of 
"reading" the West Coast Metropolis -- a mythic, symbolic reading that stands 
in direct opposition to the California-as-Eden myth fabricated in those same 
years by the railroad companies, real-estate developers, city boosters, Chamber 
of Commerce and the movies themselves. 
</P>
<P>
California was not simply the land of the fresh start and the happy ending. 
There was a dark, shadow side to the American Dream and to the intensified, 
California version of it -- to the dream that one can escape the past, reinvent 
one's life at will, be what one wishes to be. 
</P>
<P>
The writers who would write about Los Angeles in the decades ahead -- Evelyn 
Waugh, Budd Schulberg, Norman Mailer, Joan Didion, Alison Lurie, John Gregory 
Dunne, Stuart Kaminsky and others -- all took their starting point from the 
same sense of the dream gone haywire. The promise of new beginnings can be an 
elusive one, can in fact sour into an invitation to sure disaster. One can lose 
as well as find oneself in the fluidity of Southern California.

STATE OF THE ART FOR FILMS

By Jack Mathews, Jack Mathews, film editor of The Times, assesses the software 
situation in the laser-disc market and offers tips for starting a home movie 
library.

<TEXT>
<P>
The overriding consideration for anyone about to start a collection of laser 
disc movies should be simply this: Are these movies you want to keep forever 
and see often? 
</P>
<P>
Watching movies on video disc vastly enhances the experience at home, so, 
logically, the first 10 movies you buy on disc should be the 10 you enjoy most 
anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
But logic is easily jostled when you hit the video shop and see what's actually 
available. 
</P>
<P>
The truth is, I can watch any of my top 10 movies on videotape and be content. 
It is those video releases that feature extraordinary visual detail, 
mind-altering sound tracks or supplementary material about the making of the 
movie that take full advantage of laser technology. 
</P>
<P>
"RoboCop" is not a great movie, but slip a disc of it into your laser player, 
turn the sound up and it'll slap you around like a cheap cologne. "The 
Magnificent Ambersons" is far from Orson Welles' greatest film, but the 
Criterion Collection version provides so much detail about RKO's plundering of 
it that one viewing will qualify you for a studio job where you might get the 
opportunity to ruin somebody else's work. 
</P>
<P>
Things are happening fast in the video software industry, and soon, hopefully, 
everyone will follow the lead of Voyager's Criterion series in making films 
available in full width and with historical addenda. Some studios -- 20th 
Century Fox and MCA/Universal -- have already begun to issue letter-boxed 
versions of wide-screen films on disc. 
</P>
<P>
For the time being, Criterion is the leader in the field and for those who want 
everything the market has to offer, they have the list. Here are 10 video 
films, nine from Criterion, for the new collector to consider: 
</P>
<P>
1. "Singin' in the Rain." Criterion. Ron Haver, the film curator for Los 
Angeles County Museum of Art, narrates this pristine transfer of the 1952 MGM 
musical starring Gene Kelly, Donald O'Connor and Debbie Reynolds. That is, 
Haver narrates on the second audio track, if you're interested. And you should 
be. The film has a rich store of trivia, providing such details as who was 
dubbing who in the singing scenes (at one point, Reynolds dubbed Jean Hagen; at 
another, Hagen dubbed Reynolds dubbing Hagen) and the fact that O'Connor was 
wearing padding when he did his famous "Make 'em Laugh" dance. 
</P>
<P>
2. "The Wizard of Oz." Criterion. The supplementary material includes stills 
from a 1903 stage version of "Oz," footage from the 1925 silent film and the 
"If I Only Had a Brain" musical number that was cut from the released version. 
There is also a second track audio essay by Ron Haver. 
</P>
<P>
3. "The Adventures of Robin Hood." Criterion. The 1938 swashbuckling adventure 
takes on new life in this exquisite film-to-disc transfer of one of the most 
overlooked early Technicolor films. The film stars Errol Flynn and Olivia de 
Havilland; the disc stars, on a second audio track, an excellent essay by Rudy 
Behlmer, plus clips from the 1922 Douglas Fairbanks silent film and an 
assortment of Robin Hood mementos. 
</P>
<P>
4. "Casablanca." Criterion. While Ted Turner was painting a version of this 
romantic classic for his cable outlets, Criterion was transferring a perfect 
print to disc and enhancing it with a Ron Haver essay discussing the 
controversial authorship of the screenplay, plus excerpts from the "Lux Radio 
Broadcast" of "Casablanca" that starred the voices of Alan Ladd and Hedy 
Lamarr, notes from producer Hal Wallis and, for curiosity value only, 1942 
newsreel footage of the real Casablanca (the movie was shot in Culver City). 
</P>
<P>
5. "West Side Story." Criterion. The transfer from film to disc was supervised 
by the film's co-director Robert Wise, so the images are about as good as they 
can get, and it has a dazzling Dolby digital surround-sound audio track. 
Supplementary material includes a director's scrapbook, casting and production 
notes, color story boards and footage from the 1961 premiere. 
</P>
<P>
6. "Swing Time." Criterion. Arguably the best of the Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers 
dancing love stories, this one features Astaire's classic Bojangles shadow 
dance and the couple's airy "Pick Yourself Up" number in a dance school 
ballroom. There's an enlightening audio essay by Astaire authority John 
Mueller, and a lengthy Bojangles Robinson dance number from the 1935 "Hooray 
for Love." Follow Astaire and Rogers through one of their numbers with the 
perfect laser stop action and you still won't catch them out of step. 
</P>
<P>
7. "Blade Runner." Criterion. Remember the dopey Raymond Chandler-style 
narrative that Harrison Ford was asked to provide for this futuristic thriller? 
With the dazzling imagery on your set and the sounds coming out of your four 
speakers (yeah, you really have to upgrade to surround sound, too), you'll be 
concentrating so hard on not falling out of your chair that you won't even 
notice the plot holes. 
</P>
<P>
8. "Citizen Kane." Criterion. Most people will never see Orson Welles' 1941 
masterpiece anywhere but on television, where both the subtle and dramatic 
shadowing are often lost. But laser disc projects them to stunning effect. This 
version includes an audio track and a vast assortment of supplementary 
material, including the offbeat theatrical trailer Welles created to introduce 
his then unknown cast. 
</P>
<P>
9. "2001: A Space Odyssey." Criterion. A must for laser collectors, the Stanley 
Kubrick existential outer-space classic comes on disc with a huge store of 
footnotes, including "2001" author Arthur C. Clarke's views on space, the 
making of the film and a montage of actual NASA footage. 
</P>
<P>
10. "Die Hard." 20th Century Fox. This film won't make you smarter, but with 
laser, it's an E ticket ride through your living room. The film is 
letter-boxed, as are all the post-1959 Criterion films and many of the new ones 
from Fox and MCA/Universal, and the wide-screen images are breathtaking even on 
the small screen. 
</P>

THE LASER VIDEO DISC WILL DO TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT IN THE NEXT DECADE WHAT THE 
VCR DID IN THE EIGHTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Jack Mathews, film editor of The Times, assesses the software 
situation in the laser-disc market and offers tips for starting a home movie 
library.

<TEXT>
<P>
Ten years ago, when America was saying goodby to the decade that bred both 
Watergate and the pet rock, the film and electronics industries were fresh 
allies on the brink of the biggest home entertainment revolution since the 
invention of television. 
</P>
<P>
Now, as we say goodby to the decade that bred Contragate and designer water, 
they are inching toward the brink again. Having spoiled us rotten with 
cost-efficient VCRs, neighborhood video stores and $2 movie rentals,the 
Hollywood and Tokyo-based partners are about to lead us out of the Fuzzy Age of 
videotape and into the 425-lines-of-resolution, four-channel digital audio age 
of the video disc. 
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, we got used to watching movies cheaply at home, at our 
convenience, without commercial interruptions. In the 1990s, we will get used 
to watching them under conditions that will almost duplicate the experience in 
first-run theaters. That means we will switch to larger, higher-definition 
screen TV sets and, most likely, to laser video-disc players. 
</P>
<P>
The thousands of techologically hip who have already installed video-disc 
players at home have long known the advantages of discs over tape, not only for 
viewing movies but for filmed concerts, interactive lectures and for film 
study, as well. Laser delivers vastly sharper images and crisper, fuller sound, 
but the album-size discs can also be encoded to show both motion and still 
pictures, and though the discs themselves are more expensive to manufacture and 
encode than videotape cassettes, they never wear out. 
</P>
<P>
"A lot of this I don't understand, but what I do understand is (we're building) 
a knowledgeable movie audience," said former Academy of Motion Pictures Arts 
and Sciences president Fay Kanin, at a recent event where film cinematographers 
gathered for a demonstration of video-disc technology. "I remember the first 
time I went out to a video store . . . and saw those rows of films and the 
people's excitement, I really thought the millenium had come. You're now 
educating a public to understand what (movies) are all about." 
</P>
<P>
Movies -- first threatened with obsolescence by radio, then TV, then home video 
-- are stronger than ever as we enter the last decade of the first electronic 
century, and whatever the 1990s bring, they will likely be stronger in the year 
2000. Japanese electronics giant Sony closed out the '80s with its purchase of 
Columbia Pictures, and other foreign buyers -- more from the Land of the Rising 
Sun, to be sure -- will follow. 
</P>
<P>
The "Made in Japan" label that used to serve as a warning sign on tinny 
5-and-dime gadgets is now a boast of excellence on robot-assembled automotive 
and electronics goods. Having captured the bulk of the hardware market in the 
still growing home electronics industry, the Japanese's next frontier for 
expansion is here, in Hollywood, where -- despite a measurable slide in quality 
control -- the "Made in the U.S.A." label still means something. 
</P>
<P>
The colorizing of black-and-white classic movies provided one of the 1980s' 
hottest technological controversies, but that aesthetic felony, along with the 
equally crass mayhem done on wide-screen films to make them fit the nearly 
square TV format, will be forgotten like bad wine once wide-screen, 
high-resolution TV is here. 
</P>
<P>
Sony executives, in the afterglow of their purchase of Columbia Pictures, talk 
about the future they see for Sony's high-definition video technology for film 
production. By shooting and editing movies on videotape then transferring the 
final version to film, they say production costs can be drastically reduced. 
This is true, especially with films laden with expensive special effects, but 
will anybody want to see the movies? 
</P>
<P>
In the few instances where the tape-to-film process has already been used -- in 
the Kathleen Turner film "Julia and Julia," for instance -- audiences thought 
they were watching a TV soap opera in a theater. Most front-rank film directors 
wouldn't touch tape with a 10-foot boom pole. 
</P>
<P>
"The Sony people are deluding themselves into thinking video will ever replace 
film," said director Joe Dante ("Gremlins"), a keen follower of cutting-edge 
film technology. "I can't believe that outside porno theaters, audiences will 
accept that kind of quality." 
</P>
<P>
Does that mean film and film projectors will still be the way movies are shown 
in theaters 10 years from now? Possibly. The 35-millimeter, 
24-frames-per-second system of filming and projection has been the standard for 
about 70 years. There have been occasional technological forays into theatrical 
exotica: 3-D, Cinemascope, Cinerama, 70-mm, Imax, Showscan (70-mm shot at 60 
frames per second). But the real adventures ahead are, as they were in the 
'80s, more likely to occur at home than in the multiplex. 
</P>
<P>
People with large screens, video-disc players and proper surround-sound audio 
systems have already glimpsed and heard the future and even with the current 
limitations, it looks bright and sounds clear. Such wide-screen films as 
"Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Robe" are already available on video disc in 
their original full frame format. The "letterboxed" discs create a black band 
above and below the film's image, a distraction that American marketing mavens 
believe will cause resistance among consumers here. 
</P>
<P>
As the Japanese gain a greater say in the software sold in the U.S., they may 
be less daunted by that problem. In their country, the video-disc player and 
letterboxed movies are in wider use than squared films on videotape. If the 
future of home entertainment is movies (let's be optimistic and assume the 
future isn't "Married . . . With Children"), it is inevitable that the coming 
high-definition changeover will also bring with it a wider TV screen. After 
all, the square screen only became the standard because when TV was invented, 
movies were square. 
</P>
<P>
In any case, the video-disc player is apt to become the TV accessory of choice 
in the next few years, and in fact, the revolution has already begun. More than 
4,000 films have been transferred to laser discs, disc players are now 
competitively priced with VCRs, and in a growing number of instances, video 
discs offer features that videotape engineers can only dream of. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Monica-based Voyager Company, through its inspired Criterion Collection, 
has been letterboxing wide-screen films for several years. Some of the major 
studios are now doing it, as well. 
</P>
<P>
For knowledgeable movie fans, a group whose size has multiplied with the advent 
of home video, the Criterion discs are a revelation. Such classic films as 
"Singin' in the Rain" and "Citizen Kane" become both perfect-presentation 
movies and annotated film courses. You can watch "Singin' in the Rain" in all 
its Technicolor glory with its original sound track, or you can flip a switch 
on your remote control and have Ron Haver, film curator for the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art, explain how each scene was shot, who dubbed whose voices, 
and how the film got made in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
At the end of each Criterion release, you get an assortment of ancillary sights 
and sounds. For "The Magnificent Ambersons," the followup to "Citizen Kane" 
that was taken away from Orson Welles and re-redited by RKO, you can not only 
read the original script and note the studio debauchery, but listen to Welles' 
"Mercury Theatre" radio play that inspired the movie. 
</P>
<P>
The supplementary material often includes illustrated story boards (you can see 
how Alfred Hitchcock carefully blocked out the famous crop duster scene for 
"North by Northwest"), still photos, trailers, star and director interviews, 
and scenes that do not appear in the film, either because there wasn't room (a 
Scarecrow and Dorothy number from "The Wizard of Oz," for instance) or because 
there were miscues when shot (there's a painful shot of a stuntman leaping from 
a trolley and landing on his rear end on a paved street for a scene in "Singin' 
in the Rain"). 
</P>
<P>
While our homes are being converted from tape to disc, school rooms and lecture 
halls will get theirs, too. The laser player, projecting from discs that can 
hold more than 100,000 instantly retrievable still photo images, is going to 
make the slide projector seem about as current as a washboard. 
</P>
<P>
Entire museums of art can be put on one disc, indexed and selectively projected 
onto screens. Encyclopaedia Brittanica has transferred more than 100 of its 
educational films to disc and other publishers are moving quickly to create a 
software inventory for the hardware explosion that, with the sudden drop in 
prices, seems inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the cost of quality laser video-disc players has remained high 
compared to VCRs. Now, players equipped with digital stereo sound and capable 
of playing both standard and extended play discs are priced under $500. Since 
the same machines also play all sizes of compact disc recordings, it is cheaper 
to upgrade a home entertainment system with a combination laser video and 
compact-disc player than to buy a compact-disc player and VCR. For about $250 
more, you can add equipment that will make your player interactive, meaning 
that you can buy the indexed three-disc set of "The Louvre," and with a push of 
a button, call up any of the 6,000 pieces of art transferred from the famed 
Paris museum. 
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, there are between 500,000 and one million 
video-disc players in U.S. households, a fraction of the estimated 60 million 
VCRs in use. The number of films available on disc has lagged way behind those 
on tape, but the presses are busy now. Almost all new films are transferred to 
disc and many of the classic films are getting the kind of specialized 
treatment -- the letterboxing, narration and supplemental material -- for which 
Voyager's Criterion has become known. 
</P>
<P>
The prices of discs are coming down, too. Movies on discs sell for from $25 to 
$40 (Criterion's extended treatment discs go for as much as $125) and in major 
markets like Los Angeles and New York, are readily available for daily rental 
at rates comparable to those charged for tapes. 
</P>
<P>
It is ironic that most of the technology for video-disc players has been around 
almost as long as the VCR. Video-disc players were being demonstrated at 
consumer electronics shows in the late '70s, in the next booth over from tape 
demos. The images and sounds were better even then, but eccentricities in both 
the market and some of the equipment combined to give video a 10-year public 
relations setback. 
</P>
<P>
The most heavily marketed early disc player was RCA's Selectivision, a machine 
that used a needle and turntable to mimic conventional record players. Besides 
the video confusion this caused whenever the family dog leaned against the 
stereo cabinet and attempted to dislodge a flea, the discs seemed fragile and 
distractingly mysterious. 
</P>
<P>
It was also assumed that the greatest use of home video would be to record 
television shows for later viewing. Few people besides those who got rich on it 
foresaw the day when the sales of movies on videotape would exceed box-office 
grosses for first-run movies (home video revenues passed theatrical's in the 
mid-'80s). 
</P>
<P>
Finally, most Americans were satisfied with the relatively poor quality of 
their TV images, and they hadn't even thought of how much better movies would 
sound if the tracks were pumped through their amplifiers and stereo speakers 
instead of being strained through the three-inch mufflers that came with their 
sets. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining drawback to the laser player is its inability to record broadcast 
and cable signals. But even that objection can be over-ruled. Most people who 
move up to disc already have VCRs, and home entertainment systems can 
accomodate both machines. Industry experts say that the need for a machine that 
both records and plays will be met sometime in the '90s, either with the 
introduction of recordable discs (the technology exists, but the price is now 
prohibitive) or with a laser player that includes an 8-millimeter videocassette 
component. 
</P>
<P>
In any event, the logical next step for millions of consumers who have gone 
from being captives of network schedules to having discretionary choice over 
thousands of home entertainment options is to enhance the quality of their 
experience.

COMMENTARY

By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
Last summer, the Greek-born artist Jannis Kounellis had an abrupt change of 
heart and withdrew from an exhibition planned for late November at the Museum 
of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
Into the suddenly gaping hole in its schedule, the museum slotted a potentially 
snore-inducing exhibition, dubbed "Constructing a History: A Focus on the 
Permanent Collection." But what began as filler unexpectedly emerged as a 
fascinating excursion into art of the recent past -- a voyage that raises 
provocative questions for museums everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
The Museum of Contemporary Art began to form its collection nearly a decade 
ago. Along the way, special exhibitions have been mounted of major bequests and 
acquisitions, including the celebrated Panza, Barry Lowen, and Rita and Taft 
Schreiber collections. But never has the museum had a substantive portion of 
its holdings (today numbering about 1,000 pieces) on regular view. The absence 
of a relatively stable array of galleries devoted day-in, day-out to the 
meat-and-potatoes stuff of a museum -- a truly permanent permanent-collection, 
so to speak -- has always been a serious weakness. 
</P>
<P>
The suspicion has been that MOCA's collection simply wasn't strong enough to 
hold its own. Certainly there are big gaps, but "Constructing a History" shows 
there's more than one curatorial way to skin a cat. The scheduling disaster has 
turned out to be a boon. 
</P>
<P>
Organized by curator Ann Goldstein, "Constructing a History" shuffles the 
historical deck in eye-opening ways. Chronology is abandoned, groupings are 
arbitrarily made. One gallery might have paintings and sculptures from the 
1950s, the next an arrangement with works that span nearly 50 years. A room may 
be filled with chiefly monochromatic works, offering a surprising range via 
minimal means, or with images that chronicle the visceral, social and symbolic 
uses of landscape. 
</P>
<P>
Mediums get mixed. Juxtapositions jostle. (In the most dramatic, small 
photographs by Edward Weston and Brassai hang next to Jackson Pollock's 
magisterial 1949 drip-painting, "Number 1." All three suddenly reveal a poetic 
intimacy.) Throughout, works by internationally acclaimed modern masters are 
installed side by side with those by artists of much younger, less established 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
There's even an insightful pause in the action. Smack in the middle of the 
show, a second exhibition has been mounted. These "Selections From the 
Collection of Philip and Beatrice Gersh," a Beverly Hills couple who are 
well-known collectors nationally, italicize an important point: The stories 
institutions tell about the history of art are fundamentally shaped by the 
smaller narratives of individual private collectors. Indeed, the labels show 
that several important works from the Gersh collection, including David Smith's 
1961 sculpture of brushed aluminum, "Cubi III," are promised gifts to the 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, a lot is going on in this exhibition. And somehow, it works. 
</P>
<P>
At least, most of it does. Many of the 150 paintings, sculptures, 
installations, photographs and prints are first-rate, but a good number are 
not. Certain galleries feel cramped, others seem haphazard. Confusing signage 
leaves you unclear as to where the Gersh collection ends and the museum 
collection begins. (Maybe that's the clever point? Nah.) 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the complaints, they're soon pushed aside. For this is an exhibition 
that gets pulled off through sheer, self-evident curiosity about works of art, 
and about how they mean what they mean. In subtle and insightful ways, it 
invites you into its own process of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
With just five works, the very first gallery sets the stage. Julian Schnabel's 
chunky "Corinne Near Armenia" (1984), a lumbering classical figure painted 
across a field of rubble, and Anselm Kiefer's "Wege I" (1977), a smoky-black 
miasma of printed heads of great German thinkers of the past, announce that 
history itself will be the subject of the show. Very different mixed-media 
works by Louise Lawler and Allen Ruppersberg pointedly suggest that a museum is 
a very particular, and specifically modern, frame of reference through which 
history gets visually written. (The murderous imagery of Ruppersberg's 1982 
diptych, "Still Life," sardonically casts the museum as mausoleum.) 
</P>
<P>
These twin poles -- history and museum -- tend to be invisibly merged in most 
installations. Stephen Prina's "Aristotle-Plato-Socrates" brilliantly opens 
them up to scrutiny. Using recorded sound, graphics, bookplates and 
reproductions of famous paintings, Prina threads the founding philosophers of 
ancient Western culture through two of modern culture's founding fathers -- 
Rembrandt van Rijn and Jacques-Louis David -- then subjects them to the present 
world of science and technology. It makes for a compelling rumination on 
freedom and its illusions. 
</P>
<P>
In the space of a few minutes, this first gallery makes something plain: We are 
not about to see a show in which the course of art since 1945 is thought to 
have been all sewn up. We won't enter a collection that follows a prearranged 
narrative, into which the young museum will try to fill the slots with 
acquisitions. Doubtless there are major works by pivotal artists that MOCA 
would love to have. If this show is a reliable guide, however, the aim will not 
be merely to fill in the blanks. 
</P>
<P>
What will the aim be? It's risky to presume too much. This show is only 
temporary, decidedly tentative and not fully worked through. But, as far as I 
know, this presentation of the permanent collection represents something 
virtually unprecedented among American museums: It's the first, full-scale 
attempt at organizing what could be called a Postmodern Museum of Contemporary 
Art. And at this late date, that's a distinction rather startling to realize. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't news that we've been living through an extraordinary boom in new 
construction of American museums. Nor should the presses be stopped to headline 
an announcement that there's been a phenomenal rise of the cultural doctrine 
called postmodernism. These are simply two of the developments indispensable to 
any reckoning of where we've been in the decade that ends today, as well as to 
any hazy speculation about where we might be headed in the one that blasts off, 
ready or not, come Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
You would not be witless if you assumed that new museums and new art might have 
something to do with one another. You certainly would be forgiven, however, if 
you couldn't say just what that relationship might be. Why? Well, I know this 
will be hard to believe, but museums, which solemnly boast of the decisive 
importance of their educational mission in all things artistic, aren't doing 
very much to help. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, to look at art museums across the land, whether old and stately or new 
and aggressive (or some other combination thereof), you would likely never know 
that something called postmodernism had ever happened. At least, you would 
never know it was anything more than a stylistic comet that had come and gone 
in the cultural cosmos, leaving behind a modest shower of dazzling lights and 
an annoyingly large cloud of murky dust. 
</P>
<P>
Part of the problem in any discussion of postmodernism is the slipperiness of 
the term, which can mean different things to different people (not to mention 
the headache-inducing locutions of cheery, related activities such as 
hermeneutics and deconstructionism). The field is an intricate tangle. 
</P>
<P>
Not long ago, UC Irvine professor of history John Patrick Higgins came to the 
rescue, describing postmodernism in as succinct a manner as any I've seen. So, 
in an effort to make sure we're all on the same track, and in a thoroughly 
postmodern spirit of appropriation, I've stolen his definition for my own: 
"Postmodernism is the Paris-inspired, Nietzsche-influenced school of thought 
that claims there is no objective knowledge but simply interpretations and 
rhetorical persuasions." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, numerous museums have been acquiring art that fits this tidy 
description, and some have been acquiring it at a relatively furious pace. 
Typically, their holdings are organized according to a chronological history of 
styles. Those with large collections tend to insert postmodernism as a recent 
link in the long and venerable chain. 
</P>
<P>
Postmodernism, however, is not a pictorial style. It is a way of thinking. And 
one of its principal thoughts has been that it is time to sever the very chain 
of stylistic history that museums have helped to forge, a chain that has become 
as much a confining shackle as a stabilizing anchor. 
</P>
<P>
I suppose we shouldn't be surprised that institutions haven't rushed to 
embrace, promote and put into practice a principle that would seem to require a 
thorough overhaul of everything they've long held dear. But here's a dilemma: 
How can museums, which in increasing numbers are rushing to embrace 
contemporary art, effectively deal with a school of artistic thought that is 
essentially contradictory to their own established patterns? 
</P>
<P>
Inadvertently or not, the Museum of Contemporary Art is tackling the conundrum. 
The experience of going there is individualized, made refreshingly surprising. 
"Constructing a History" manages to break the cookie-cutter mold, whereby 
museum collections everywhere are looking more and more alike. 
</P>
<P>
For me, the biggest surprise of all, and the one that persuades me the museum 
is onto something, is that I was actually engaged by the inclusion of Jules 
Olitski's monumental 1967 canvas, "Tender Boogus." Inch for inch -- and there 
are a lot of them in this 21-foot-long painting -- this is probably the 
silliest, most vapid work around. So what's the deal? 
</P>
<P>
Olitski's position in the 1960s is fixed. As the avatar of color-field 
painting, proposed by the influential critic Clement Greenberg to be the most 
important art at a moment when Pop and Minimalism were disrupting the flow of 
aesthetic traffic, Olitski was set up as a historical inevitability -- as next 
in line to be acclaimed a master. It didn't happen. A minor distraction, 
color-field painting got run over. 
</P>
<P>
The episode, still being sorted out today, is a pivotal one, and certainly ripe 
for any serious understanding of recent history. But how to acknowledge it in a 
museum? 
</P>
<P>
If organized according to the history of styles, a collection featuring Olitski 
would appear to regard him as a genius. One that banished him from the kingdom 
would leave an embarrassing hole, conspicuously suggesting he's a colossal flop 
and rendering the historical moment unspeakable. Either way, culture gets 
played as a gross cartoon. 
</P>
<P>
At the Museum of Contemporary Art, however, you've been primed. Rather than 
links in a chain, history is offered as a matter of discussion, argument and 
persuasion, spoken through the language of art. No longer a fixed polemic, 
"Tender Boogus" is restored to being simply a painting. Not a very good one, in 
my far from lonely estimation, but that's the point: Critically poised, you 
find yourself looking at a work of art and asking, How did history happen? 
</P>
<P>
In the permanent collection of a museum, who could ask for more?

CURRENT PAPERBACKS: CRYSTAL BOYS BY PAI HSIEN-YUNG TRANSLATED BY HOWARD

"Crystal Boys" is the first Chinese novel to focus on the buoliquan (literally 
"glass community") or gay subculture. After being thrown out of his home by his 
father, A-Qing , a young man in his late teens, enters the world of hustlers, 
pickpockets and petty con men who frequent a seedy park in Taipei. The 
Taiwanese counterculture in "Crystal Boys" is oddly reminiscent of the gay 
underworld that John Rechy described in "City of Night:" a hidden realm with 
its special names, code of conduct and values that extend to a private 
mythology centered on the ill-starred love of the socially prominent Dragon 
Prince for the wild delinquent, Phoenix Boy. Pai Hsien-yung uses his 
characters' gritty adventures to explore the conflict between the desire for 
Western material goods and traditional Chinese mores. Although his work is 
virtually unknown in the United States, Hsien-yung's novels are highly 
respected in Taiwan and much of the rest of the world.

THE BOOK TRADE: THE DECADE OF THE MASS-MARKET HARDCOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH MEHREN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The collective murmur at the end of this strange year and decade in publishing 
climbed straight out of Lewis Carroll. 
</P>
<P>
"Curiouser and curiouser," people throughout the industry were remarking. For 
the most part, their comments were not accompanied by optimistic smiles. 
</P>
<P>
The final few weeks of 1989 seemed to reflect the turbulence of the entire 10 
years. One publishing executive, heading off to a holiday party, wryly summed 
it up when he suggested that these days, you couldn't be too sure. What was 
billed as a festive gathering just might turn out to be another corporate 
beheading. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the infamous Halloween Massacre, where a roomful of E. P. Dutton 
editors and other employees learned that their jobs had been eliminated along 
with Dutton's entire adult trade (mainstream fiction and nonfiction) division. 
As fast as anyone in the room could say "trick or treat," the 137-year-old 
operation became an imprint within Penguin USA. 
</P>
<P>
At Random House, Robert L. Bernstein closed the year with the stunning 
announcement that he would leave the company he had headed for 23 years. 
Whether Bernstein's departure was entirely voluntary or was encouraged by the 
Newhouse family, which owns Random House, remained a matter of speculation. 
Within weeks, Alberto Vitale, president and chief executive of Bantam Doubleday 
Dell, was named to replace Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
If Bernstein had been regarded, as one top executive from another house put it, 
as "a man of letters," Vitale was hailed as a money man -- "a guy," said this 
executive, "who can wield an ax and bring order into a situation of confusion." 
</P>
<P>
Money might be an unacceptable topic at refined dinner parties, but in the 
1980s, publishing was in a kind of revolution. And as Chairman Mao so 
succinctly reminded us, a revolution is not a dinner party. 
</P>
<P>
"Never forget that this is a business and not the Library of Congress," Stuart 
Applebaum, one of Vitale's former colleagues at Bantam Doubleday Dell, said. 
</P>
<P>
Just before Thanksgiving, Simon &amp; Schuster revealed that it would declare a 
$140-million pretax write-off -- translation: a hefty loss -- this year. Simon 
&amp; Schuster is this country's largest book publisher. 
</P>
<P>
Many in the industry said the year had been marked not only by 
disproportionately large advances but by record returns to publishers of unsold 
books. For books that were in the large-advance category, print runs that 
turned out to be excessive made these returns particularly painful. 
</P>
<P>
Coming as they did on the heels of a series of major corporate consolidations 
and takeovers, the events of late 1989 did seem to rattle what had until then 
been a general mood of confidence. 
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, I think they are all having the same kind of nausea," said 
Roger Straus, the head of Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, one of the few surviving 
independent publishing houses. Entering the 1990s, Straus said, publishing was 
"a dinner where everyone was attacked by the same ptomaine." 
</P>
<P>
In particular, Straus objected to what he called this decade's "auction fever," 
where "a handful of agents have fueled the greed of authors by telling them: 'I 
can get you $3 million for this book.' " But then, he added, "you have the 
publishers being stupid enough to say, 'Yeah, I'll give you that kind of 
money.' " 
</P>
<P>
Gigantic advances, said Applebaum, the vice president for publicity and 
promotion at Bantam Doubleday Dell, "are probably having a deleterious effect 
on book publishing, because basically they are not earning (the advances) back 
through sales and other revenues, thereby producing red ink, thereby further 
torpedoing profits at the publishing houses." 
</P>
<P>
One example that immediately came to the minds of several publishing executives 
was "My Turn," the acerbic best-selling autobiography by former First Lady 
Nancy Reagan. Though the book has garnered immense attention, it was 
commissioned by Random House with an advance widely reported to be in the 
$2-million range. "They're never going to get that back," a rival publisher 
said. 
</P>
<P>
At Houghton Mifflin, John Sterling, editor-in-chief of adult trade books, 
concurred, talking about a "fever that has gone bad" in publishing. 
</P>
<P>
"You have these two giant dark engines that have driven a lot of what is wrong 
in adult trade books," Sterling said. "Number 1 is the size of the advances. 
Number 2 is the size of advance shipments." 
</P>
<P>
If looking at this year in publishing also means looking at the decade, 
Sterling, for one, points out, it's important to note that for much of the last 
10 years, the publishing industry has benefited from a general upswing in the 
American economy. "We have not really had a serious downturn in the U.S. 
economy or in the publishing business in the last seven years," Sterling said. 
</P>
<P>
"So much of what has happened has depended on a healthy economy. That kind of 
healthy economy just did not happen in the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
A positive environment for business in general has allowed book chains to 
introduce discount pricing as a daily event in book-selling and book-buying. In 
turn, publishers became more inventive in seeking out new marketing ventures. 
Once considered a rather rarefied commodity, the clothbound books of the 1980s 
were to be found on sale in drugstores, right alongside the mousse and 
conditioner, and in supermarkets, not far from the roast beef. 
</P>
<P>
Given the rising price of hair products and beef, moreover, discount-priced 
cloth books did not seem like much of an indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
The book jacket may carry a $20 price tag, but "people say, 'golly, I can get 
Stephen King for $12.56!' " Sterling said. 
</P>
<P>
Spurred largely by the book chains, the change in cloth pricing combined with 
more aggressive marketing by publishers to alter consumer buying patterns. 
Readers who once habitually waited for a title to appear in paperback now began 
rushing to buy it in cloth. One resulting trend of the last decade and the last 
year was a simultaneous softening of paperback sales and boosting of cloth-book 
consumption. 
</P>
<P>
"You learned to hook your customer," the vice president of one publishing house 
said. "You first trained people not to be able to wait for the paperback; then 
after a while they wanted to go for a higher quality." 
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, she continued, cloth sales were simply seen in a different 
numerical light. "We went from a huge best seller being 75,000 copies to it 
being 1.2 million," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of the 1980s, you could not imagine first printings of 
500,000. The fact that there are any is absolutely amazing. The fact that 1.5 
million people walk into a bookstore and pay $20 -- and up -- for a hardcover 
book is mind-boggling." 
</P>
<P>
And "obviously," as Roger Straus noted in what might be the first lesson of The 
Economics of Publishing 101, "it is far more profitable to sell a $20 book than 
a $4.95 book." 
</P>
<P>
"The culture just moves too fast," said Sterling. "People used to wait for the 
paperback. Not any more." 
</P>
<P>
That appetite for instant literary gratification has been carefully nurtured by 
publishers who have applied new skills and sophistication to the art of 
creating and enhancing a market. 
</P>
<P>
"It used to be that publicity was looked upon as a kind of frivolous enterprise 
that you gave to the pretty, but ditzy, person who really didn't have a future 
on the editorial side," Applebaum, of Bantam Doubleday Dell, said. Now, he 
continued, along with eager and aggressive publicity departments, "you have 
whole new worlds of media coaching and strategic positioning which heretofore 
have not gone into this courtly business known as book publishing." 
</P>
<P>
But Applebaum was quick to add, "Really, you need that. Unlike other businesses 
that are akin to ours -- such as television, movies or recorded music -- 
publicity, which includes book reviews, is overwhelmingly the driving force 
behind book sales." 
</P>
<P>
Apologizing to Webster, one publisher cited "conglomeratization" and 
commercialism as the two hallmarks of the decade in publishing. Neither might 
bode well for the big houses, he conceded, but in their wake, he suggested, the 
smaller presses may begin to enjoy their long-awaited flowering. 
</P>
<P>
At North Point Press in Berkeley, however, editor-in-chief John Shoemaker was 
less sanguine. His house was born along with the decade, making its debut on 
Jan. 1, 1980, and although "our business has shown very steady growth," 
Shoemaker said that among the smaller presses, "I think all of us are fighting 
an uphill struggle to survive." 
</P>
<P>
After the initial surge of power from the bookselling chains, "the last six 
years of this decade have seen a tremendous growth in viable independent 
bookstores" that tend to be more receptive to the titles of small-press houses, 
Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"But I think that we publish too many titles in this country" -- about 40,000 
titles annually, by most reliable accounts -- "and we are all competing for a 
steadily shrinking number of buyers in the face of an increasingly illiterate 
society," Shoemaker said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we could sell one book to the number of people who attend a single Dallas 
Cowboys football game, we could be on the New York Times best-seller list for 
six months," Shoemaker said. "But that doesn't happen too often." 
</P>
<P>
Among the larger publishers, the excesses in advances and print runs surely 
will be corrected, many in publishing predicted. "It's gotten out of hand," 
said Roger Straus, for one, "and I think the hand is about to be tightened." 
</P>
<P>
But any constraints will definitely affect the reader, he predicted. "The 
reader will have fewer books of some quality than he has," Straus said, citing 
"belles lettres, essays, biography and experimental novels" as genres that may 
feel the pinch. 
</P>
<P>
Still, not everyone in publishing was humming dirges as the year and the decade 
came to an end. The climate was cold, Stuart Applebaum said, and "it is not 
going to improve dramatically in the near future." But "there's nothing wrong 
with publishing presently that could not be cured by more consumers going into 
bookstores and buying books."

"Out with the old year, in with with the new!" "Out with the old decade, in 
with the new!" And now begins the countdown to "Out with the old century, in 
with the new!" And even "Out with the old millennium, in with the new!" But who 
is this star of so many entrances andf exits? What is time? Book Review's New 
Year's greeting is a set of answers to those questions as offered in a chapter 
from "Zen to Go" (A Plume Book/New American Library: $14.95) by Jon Winokur, a 
Los Angeles writer whose most recent book is "A Curmudgeon's Garden of Love."

The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies 
he only appears to die. He is still very much alive in the past, so it is very 
silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present and future, 
always have existed, always will exist. The Tralfamadorians can look at all the 
different moments just the way we can look at a stretch of the Rocky Mountains, 
for instance. They can see how permanent all the moments are, and they can look 
at any moment that interests them. It is just an illusion we have here on Earth 
that one moment follows another one, like beads on a string, and that once a 
moment is gone it is gone forever.

THE FABULOUS INVALID LOOKS AHEAD; 
</P>
<P>
WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE MORE PERFORMANCE ART AND AUDIENCE-PARTICIPATION THEATER IN 
THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
Predictions for the theater in the 1990s? Certainly. 
</P>
<P>
1 -- It will continue to exist. Some theater people seem to need reassurance 
about that. They are hereby reassured. If the movies weren't able to put the 
theater out of business; if records couldn't do it; if radio and TV couldn't; 
if the VCR couldn't (the big challenge of the 1980s) -- it is a pretty tough 
form. 
</P>
<P>
It is sometimes thought of as an old-fashioned form. This is to confuse the 
container with the thing contained. The play may be old-fashioned, but there's 
nothing old-fashioned about watching a play. If this is true, then it's also 
out of date to watch Michael Jackson at Dodger Stadium. Live performer plus 
live audience equals heat. That won't change in the next decade. But: 
</P>
<P>
2 -- Theater will face dangers. We mentioned one of them in last week's column: 
self-censorship. When playwrights start deciding not to write that play because 
it will only get them into hot water, then the theater is in hot water. It's 
time for the National Endowment for the Arts to treat artistic freedom as 
something to be proud of rather than as something to halfway apologize for. How 
ironic that just as the Soviet artist gets the censor off his back, the 
American artist has to start worrying about offending Southern congressmen. 
</P>
<P>
Another danger for theater in the '90s: rising ticket prices. This is 
especially a danger on Broadway. Top Broadway ticket price in 1979 was $27.80. 
Today it is $55. Certainly the cost of living went up over the period, but not 
that much. This is a fine way to push the intelligent, not necessarily affluent 
audience to the video store. On the brighter side: 
</P>
<P>
3 -- The decentralization of the American theater will continue. Roughly twice 
as many Americans attend shows at resident theaters like the Mark Taper Forum 
and the Los Angeles Theatre Center as attend them on Broadway -- 15 million to 
7 million or 8 million. The resident theaters offer reasonable ticket prices (a 
$28 top at the Taper), strong acting, superior design and scripts that do not 
insult the intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
Here is the real American theater and our playwrights are writing for it. 
Robert Anderson, author of "Tea and Sympathy," used to say that a playwright 
could make a killing in the theater, but not a living. Not true today. Canadian 
playwright George F. Walker received a dozen resident-theater productions of 
his "Nothing Sacred" in 1987 without benefit of a New York showing. Bill Cain's 
"Stand-Up Tragedy" (which also premiered at the Taper) is building a similar 
national audience this season. Prediction: One day in the 1990s, the Pulitzer 
Prize for drama will go to a play produced in Denver or Minneapolis, and the 
New York Times will declare that resident theater has come of age. Actually, it 
did so years ago. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the '90s could see: 
</P>
<P>
4 -- Fewer theaters. At first glance, this might not be a bad thing, 
particularly in Los Angeles where too many young actors still think of the 
theater as a cheap way to audition for sitcoms. Should hard times come, the 
number of storefront theaters in town will definitely dwindle. If the houses 
that go in for champagne receptions and "industry nights" are the ones that 
fold, that won't hurt the cause of serious theater at all. However, it's 
equally possible that it will be the serious theaters that will fold -- places 
like the Odyssey and the Matrix. We still miss Peg Yorkin's L.A. Public 
Theater, one of the losses of the '80s. Less isn't always more. 
</P>
<P>
One source of help for serious theater here could be The Industry that all 
these actors in storefront theaters are trying out for. Were all three actors' 
unions -- SAG, AFTRA and Actors' Equity -- combined into one, a certain 
percentage of the payroll cost for each feature film and TV segment could go to 
a live-performance fund, similar to that of the American Federation of 
Musicians. Or, The Industry could simply donate more money to the theater, in 
return for its having developed so much of its talent. One can hope that this 
will happen in the 1990s, but don't hold your breath. 
</P>
<P>
So much for structure. What will the plays of the '90s be like? To begin with, 
they might not be plays. The '80s saw the rise of audience participation 
theater: pieces like "Tamara," "Tony 'n Tina's Wedding" and all those 
murder-mystery weekends. There will be more of these entertainments, and it's 
possible to imagine their technique being applied to more serious material, 
even to a kind of psychodrama. Leading an audience down that path could be 
tricky, but also could liberate some extraordinary energy. We have never 
forgotten some experiments along these lines 15 years ago at San Diego's 
Crystal Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The '90s are also likely to see more performance art, which we notice is more 
and more going simply by the name "performance." This is a very wide category, 
somehow stretching to include the pageants of Robert Wilson and Robert Longo 
and the solo work of Eric Bogosian, Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley, Spalding 
Gray, Tim Miller, et al. 
</P>
<P>
Performance art got its act together in the '80s. What seemed to develop was a 
consensus that exhibiting oneself on the stage wasn't enough. One had to have a 
self to exhibit. "Performance" today seems quite structured, very aware of its 
frame. Will some wild man come along in the '90s and throw a brick through the 
window? 
</P>
<P>
Karen Finley was the wild woman of the '80s. But her last performance at Los 
Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions (LACE) a couple of weeks ago was a surprise. 
Finley took the leading role in a play that she had written herself, "The 
Theory of Total Blame." 
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it was a family play. Its language was raw, its imagery hairy, but 
its concerns were the ones that keep coming up again and again in American 
drama, from Eugene O'Neill to Sam Shepard -- Why didn't Mom and Dad get along? 
Why did Dad leave? Why do I feel like such a nothing? 
</P>
<P>
The American theater will continue to be well supplied with family plays in the 
1990s. Also, it is safe to predict, there will be plenty of gospel musicals and 
revivals of "The King and I." Beyond that, the crystal ball clouds.

HOW A COUPLE'S STRUGGLE TO KEEP A DANCE STUDIO OPEN FORCED THEM TO PUSH 
PERSONAL AND COMMUNITY ASSETS TO THE LIMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE WHEELOCK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Several days a week after school, neighborhood children grab their dance 
clothes and head for Lula Washington's L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre studio 
on West Adams Boulevard. There they climb the stairs of the former Masonic 
lodge, home to her school and 10-year-old performance company, to join in 
ballet, jazz, modern and tap dance classes. 
</P>
<P>
The old brick building, which could have been lifted right out of the movie, 
"Tap," is warm and bright with sunlight and life. The floors are well-worn from 
years of dancing feet and music reverberates off walls covered with candid 
photos of dance performances. Children clatter excitedly through the hall to 
and from class, while their parents gather to watch them and exchange 
neighborhood information. 
</P>
<P>
Regular tenant troupes include Ogundo and Company, Djimbe West African Dance 
Company, Karen McDonald New Age Dance Workshop and Light Dance Company. Onaje 
Murray, who runs Onaje's Gift Shop on the upper floor, sells African artifacts, 
gift items, body oils and wood carvings. Community groups present fashion shows 
and an occasional music video company rents the hall for auditions and 
rehearsals. And registered for classes are about 75 latchkey kids who -- 
without the studio -- would be growing up on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The studio's cheerful, bustling atmosphere is quite different from what 
Washington found when she took over the building in 1982. Then her students had 
to climb over drunks and drug addicts on the stairs, and down the street a 
storefront operation dispensed illegal drugs. It took seven years of effort, 
she says, to clean up the block, an effort that was almost wasted recently when 
her studio was close to extinction, a victim of skyrocketing local land values. 
</P>
<P>
One day last June a "For Rent" sign suddenly appeared on the structure. 
Alarmed, she and her husband, writer Erwin Washington, contacted the realty 
office. Erwin says: "We were told that the owner, (actor) Taurean Blacque, was 
selling the building for real estate value only and it was likely to be torn 
down, so we knew that our continuing there was in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
And so a six-month saga began to find new quarters, punctuated by adversity, 
hope, despair, red tape, incessant delays and grass-roots determination. 
Washington's dilemma was all too familiar in this era of steadily diminishing 
arts spaces. As a veteran dancer/choreographer/teacher, Washington has watched 
the real estate squeeze force several other dance studios to disband, double up 
or move to smaller, usually more expensive quarters. 
</P>
<P>
Unlike other studios, the L.A. Contemporary Dance Theatre prevailed. On Dec. 
11, the Washingtons purchased the $225,000 building -- after pushing personal 
and community resources to the limit and mortgaging their home. But the saga 
isn't over yet. For, while the Washingtons say that their triumph was 
exhilarating, they are still faced with the prospect of constant fund raising 
to meet their new obligations. 
</P>
<P>
Lula says: "We're excited that we finally crossed this hurdle, but we know we 
still have to cross the mountain, and we're very scared." 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Washingtons' quest to buy their building offers an object 
lesson for other endangered arts organizations. With determination and 
resourcefulness, they tapped into various government and community sources to 
raise what amounts to a down payment on their future. Their story shows that it 
can be done. 
</P>
<P>
The Washingtons decided that with all that time, energy and neighborhood 
rapport invested in the building, they were reluctant to move away and start 
over. After all, Lula says, "Finding a place with good floors that lends itself 
to dance is a serious problem, and that building has great space. R'Wanda Lewis 
had her dance studio there for years before we took over the building." 
</P>
<P>
And there were more reasons for staying. Besides LACDT and a program for 
latchkey kids, the studio houses adult and children's dance classes and 
performance groups, and also rents space to other arts groups. With an 
elementary school across the street and a bus stop in front of the door, the 
building is a community focal point. As Lula says, "My main purpose in starting 
the school in 1983 was to be in the community, in a place where people who 
needed us had access to us." 
</P>
<P>
"Lula provides the quality teaching and discipline necessary to develop raw 
talent," says parent Stella Smith. "I've seen her take neighborhood kids and 
transform them into beautiful, well-trained dancers. There is just no other 
school like it close by." 
</P>
<P>
The Washingtons explored alternatives, and even considered closing the studio, 
halting the community programs and renting rehearsal space as needed for the 
nine-member company. Lula says: "When I'm discouraged I wonder why I'm doing 
this. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be easier to just rent space a couple of days a week in some plush 
Beverly Hills or Valley studio, or I could . . . choreograph for movies and 
videos. I've done that, but it was empty and unfulfilling work. I feel like I 
have to give back something to my community." 
</P>
<P>
They looked at other buildings, but found smaller, inappropriate spaces for 
quadruple their $600-a-month rent. With trepidation, but craving permanency, 
stability and freedom from rental market vagaries, they decided to take a giant 
step and buy the building, even though they had no money. 
</P>
<P>
As Lula recalls: "We said to the broker, 'We want this space. Give us a chance 
to get it.' He just laughed." However, on July 1 the Washingtons scraped 
together $1,000 and opened escrow. Then the drama began in earnest. 
</P>
<P>
"We checked with about 25 to 30 banks," says Erwin, "and they all discouraged 
us from even applying for loans because we're nonprofit and have no collateral, 
and because the earthquake upgrading would cost an additional $150,000. No one 
would lend money on such a building and everyone said, 'Forget it. There's 
nothing that can be done.' " 
</P>
<P>
At the same time they were encountering reluctance from their board of 
directors, who were opposed to the purchase of that particular building. Erwin 
says: "No one wanted to buy it. It's old, they didn't like the neighborhood and 
they thought it wasn't worth the price. But we found that buildings of that 
size in worse neighborhoods cost twice as much, so this was a bargain and we 
didn't want to lose it." 
</P>
<P>
Says opposing board member Robert Johnson, who eventually decided to support 
the effort: "At the time we voted on whether to pursue this, it did not appear 
to be a good choice, simply a convenient choice. It was where we were, and an 
opportunity to continue without a break in our activities. Other than that it 
had a lot of drawbacks, a fundamental one being that as property owners, we 
have to generate income to pay the bills. This building, as a rehearsal and 
training space, generates virtually insignificant revenue." 
</P>
<P>
Ultimately, however, the board approved, the Washingtons told Blacque they'd 
pay cash, and he agreed to their offer, setting Sept. 11 for closing. 
</P>
<P>
Now it was time to put up or give up. With traditional lending institutions out 
of the question, the couple decided to use knowledge gained at arts 
fund-raising conferences to seek out corporate and community grants and loans. 
</P>
<P>
They went to L.A. County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn, who awarded them a $20,000 
Community Development block grant. Hahn's senior deputy, Burke Roche, says: 
"There are plenty of dance classes, but not of this nature, where they 
concentrate on bringing in kids from the street and teaching them to dance and 
perform." 
</P>
<P>
L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden's office also helped with $10,000 which was 
used for rent. Herb Wesson, Holden's chief of staff, says: "We're impressed 
with what they've been able to do on a skeleton budget. Theirs is the type of 
program that kids who aren't great football, basketball or track stars can 
succeed in. We definitely need to keep this place." 
</P>
<P>
While the board was still doubtful, it was fearful of losing the childrens' 
programs, so committees were organized and an exhaustive summer program of 
weekend fund-raising performances began. A big break came when board member and 
former dancer Donald Stinson promised a $25,000 loan. He says: "Lula has a good 
reputation in the community. Her free program for deprived and under-privileged 
children has grown a lot, which shows the importance of having it there." 
</P>
<P>
As the summer weather heated up, so did the Washington's efforts. For the first 
time, Erwin says, the goal seemed reachable. Soon other board members and their 
friends began pledging. "We're a small board and not very rich," says board 
member Alice Duff, "but we tried to network with our colleagues, friends and 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
"We were too committed to let it drop and I think especially with the death of 
Alvin Ailey we have a renewed sense of how important it is to keep our dancers 
going. Lula makes sure her instruction is available to people who wouldn't 
otherwise have it and she's critical to our community." 
</P>
<P>
Studio supporters found different ways to contribute. Some company members and 
teachers performed and taught for free, students helped out at fund-raisers and 
parents made phone calls, worked on proposals and held bake sales. 
</P>
<P>
The hard part for her, Lula says, was asking for loans. "We were scared to do 
it, but we had to learn to beg. Alvin Ailey, my friend and inspiration, always 
encouraged us to get our own space and told us he begged all the time." 
</P>
<P>
The Ahmanson Foundation gave a $25,000 grant and producer Robert Greenwald 
loaned $5,000 after reading a newspaper article about the effort. He explains: 
"I grew up on the toughest New York streets where there were no artistic 
possibilities and I have a sense of the environment Lula's working in. As 
someone in the performing arts world I felt a kindred spirit. I wanted to 
support her because I feel people like that are genuine heroes and heroines." 
</P>
<P>
Funds were accumulating, but according to Erwin, although Blacque was 
supportive and wanted to sell to them, he was getting temptingly larger cash 
offers from new potential buyers. As three deadlines came and went, he grew 
impatient. 
</P>
<P>
"I liked what they're doing and I did want to keep it in the community and in 
the arts," Blacque said. "They're opening up a lot of avenues for future 
artists, and if I can be of assistance, I will be." 
</P>
<P>
Finally time ran out and, Erwin says: "with nowhere left to get money fast we 
were still $65,000 short. We had no other choice then but to mortgage our 
house, although our board objected. In mid-October we began the process of 
refinancing, which caused delay after delay for appraisals and loan 
requirements." 
</P>
<P>
Even after final approval, the house raised only $59,000 and Erwin says other 
unexpected technicalities kept popping up, a blizzard of paper work creating 
even more delays. And in the background, better-financed buyers circled like 
sharks, waiting for the Washingtons to sink. 
</P>
<P>
Finally the day came. On Dec. 11, $158,000 down payment in hand, they met with 
Blacque's broker in his office, only to find, to their shock, that they were 
$800 short because of last-minute unanticipated charges. With $50 left in their 
bank account, things looked shaky for the couple until the broker and owner of 
the escrow company together chipped in the final amount. At that point everyone 
in the office, including brokers who had tried to obtain the building for their 
own clients, applauded and congratulated the dazed Washingtons, and the 
building was theirs. 
</P>
<P>
Happy ending? Happy, yes. Ending, no. With depleted resources the Washingtons 
now must find more funding to cover the balance of purchase, renovation costs, 
loan repayments and a $2,500/month mortgage payment. 
</P>
<P>
Part of their future strategy involves renting out space in the four-unit 
building, which presents an ironic ideological conflict. "An original goal," 
says Lula, "was to rent to people in the arts, but then our board thought if 
arts tenants were struggling as much as we are, they might not be able to pay 
the rent, and that would kill us. We're still up in the air about that one." 
Also being considered is a plan to tear down and rebuild, tailored to their own 
needs, thus avoiding earthquake renovation costs. 
</P>
<P>
Looking back at the past six months, the Washingtons are surprised and grateful 
for the extent of community support they found. They plan a studio open house 
Jan. 13 from 4 to 7 p.m. to discuss their plans.

people. Now we feel there's no limit to what we can do.

"But what's really important about our story is not just that we did it. We 
hope this will motivate and inspire other artists to buy property. If they 
don't, Los Angeles real estate speculation will cause prices of arts spaces to 
go so high, small arts groups will be driven out of business."

MUSIC AND DANCE NEWS: DANCE RECLAIMS SPACE ON PBS' SCHEDULE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Dance enthusiasts who worried when PBS preempted the first two programs of this 
season's "Dance in America" series need not despair, said Jac Venza, executive 
producer of "Great Performances," the umbrella for PBS cultural programming. 
Fans will be able to see works by Nijinsky, Fosse and Balanchine beginning in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
Venza says that Nijinsky's "Sacre du Printemps" has been re-scheduled for Jan. 
12. The one-hour program, titled "The Search for Nijinsky's 'Rite of Spring,' " 
blends dance and documentary. The dance part shows the Joffrey Ballet's 
reconstruction of the work's famed choreography, once thought to be totally 
lost. The documentary includes interviews of Dame Marie Rambert (who assisted 
Nijinsky and appeared in it herself) and composer Igor Stravinsky. 
</P>
<P>
Explaining the preemptions, Venza said, "Part of programming means trying to 
put things where they'll do best." "Rite of Spring" and Nureyev's "Cinderella" 
were both originally scheduled for the holiday season -- ultimately poor 
programming decisions, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Nureyev's "Cinderella," a re-broadcast, was preempted in favor of a new program 
more appropriate for Christmas, Venza said. "Live From Lincoln Center: a 
Classical Jazz Christmas With Wynton Marsalis" replaced "Cinderella" on Dec. 
22. 
</P>
<P>
"Rite of Spring" was to air Thanksgiving weekend during sweeps month. Since 
holidays are a time for family viewing, even staunch dance lovers probably 
wouldn't watch a special interest show, Venza said. Replacing the ballet with 
"An Evening With Alan Jay Lerner," was also a way to "protect it" from being 
overlooked during the sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
"These programs already have a remarkablely low audience," Venza said. "If we 
put them on when the networks are blockbusting with new shows -- it's just not 
the time to put on special interest programming." 
</P>
<P>
The "Dance in America" season will continue with "The American Indian Dance 
Theater" on Feb. 2 followed by "Bob Fosse: Steam Heat" on Feb. 23. The three 
remaining programs, "Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas, "The Margot 
Fonteyn Story" and "A Tudor Evening" do not have firm air dates. 
</P>
<P>
MUSIC NOTES: Leonard Bernstein and Michael Tilson Thomas will be artistic

June 26-July 13, 1990. The festival will include performances by the London 
Symphony Orchestra, led by its president Bernstein and principal conductor, 
Thomas; the Japan Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra under Akio Watanabe; the 
Sapporo Symphony Orchestra, and the Pacific Music Festival Orchestra, a group 
consisting of 115 young musicians from the Pacific region. Organizers hope the 
event will help stimulate interest in the music and culture of the Pacific 
region. . . . KPSC (88.5-FM) Palm Springs officially signed on the air Dec. 1, 
bringing classical music to the desert as the the fourth public radio station 
in the USC Radio network, the entertainment and media group of the university. 
A newly constructed transmitter and antenna in the Little San Bernardino 
Mountains will broadcast 24-hour classical music, news and information to most 
of the Coachella Valley. . . . The Pasadena Symphony will present 
Shostakovich's Symphony No. 7, Opus 60 ("Leningrad") at 8:30 p.m. Jan. 13 in 
the Pasadena Civic Auditorium as the fifth installment of music director Jorge 
Mester's Shostakovich cycle. . . . The Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra has been 
awarded a $50,000 challenge grant from the California Arts Council to present 
and promote a five program festival commemorating the 200th anniversary of the 
death of Mozart in 1991. The Chamber Orchestra is one of 11 large budget 
organizations in the state to receive an award. 
</P>
<P>
PEOPLE: Zarin Mehta will succeed Edward Gordon's 22-year tenure as executive 
director and chief operating officer of the Ravinia Festival. Mehta, brother of 
conductor Zubin Mehta, has been managing director of the Montreal Symphony 
Orchestra since 1981.

Even if this were not the first recording in 20 years of the revised, Paris 
version of the opera, Sinopoli's bracing performance would attract attention 
for featuring a new generation of both genuine and hopeful Wagnerians in full 
flower. In his third studio encounter with the composer, Domingo proves a model 
minstrel, bringing improved German, even, robust tone and the requisite 
spiritual anguish to the protagonist. Studer conveys Elizabeth's redemptive 
purity in suitably radiant manner. Not the most voluptuous of Venuses, Baltsa 
scores through sheer intelligence, while Schmidt's Wolfram and Salminen's 
Landgrave are all one could ask. Sinopoli's conducting sweeps away the 
conventional "Tannhauser" sanctimoniousness on a rising tide of tension. ALLAN

GRAHAM PARKER "HUMAN SOUL." MCA ***: ALBUMS ARE RATED ON A SCALE OF ONE STAR 
(POOR) TO FIVE (A CLASSIC).

"When I get mad I'm really a drag," sings Parker by way of introducing his 
latest, contradicting the wisdom of die-hard fans who like him good 'n' angry. 
He goes on to quote his patient love: "Lighten up, fella," she tells him 
repeatedly in the chorus of the opening "Little Miss Understanding," and 
indeed, Parker spends most of the album's first side in the same sort of 
tight-lipped, R&amp;B-tinged mode that characterized most of his early- and 
mid-'80s output, being buoyed by the love of a woman who has wrought peaceful 
havoc with the work of a once perfectly bitter artist. 
</P>
<P>
A visit to his local mall in the humbly self-deprecating "Big Man on Paper" 
inspires a few broadsides on popular culture ("Look at the youth in their 
Whitesnake T-shirts / They're wearing a poor man's version of the haircut / Man 
they might as well be from another universe," he sings, more alienated from 
rock fashion than ever). But mostly, he admits, "The bills on my table / Or my 
kid's first Halloween disguise" keep him from getting too worked up over the 
sorts of things that once would have had him spitting vitriol instead of 
playing the skanking family man. 
</P>
<P>
But wait, what's this? Side 2? The "surreal side," an almost nonstop song suite 
with a harder edge in which narrator Graham sleepwalks through the bemusing, 
confusing waking dream that is the news of the world outside his domestic 
tranquility? By dividing this album into neat halves, Parker finally gets to 
have it both ways -- lover and fighter; relaxed, settled-down soulster and 
Angry Aging Man. The production could stand to be sharper and the songs are 
uneven, but in scope, ambition and self-integration, he's closed out the '80s 
with what is at least his most interesting album of the decade. CHRIS WILLMAN

Like Regina Belle, Howard is a new-generation R&amp;B singer who emerged in the 
mid-'80s. Both like to dabble with jazz, but each sounds best when opting for 
the unburnished soul route. Like Belle, Howard (who headlines the Roxy tonight 
and Monday) is a stylish vocalist who is frequently at the mercy of her 
producers and material. When they're not in peak form, she can't always rise 
above them. The producer who serves Howard best on this project is Nick 
Martinelli. The sure touch he supplies on "Love Under New Management" is superb 
and he gets a rich, gospel-fueled performance out of the Chicago-born singer. 
The rest of the album is spotty, going from excellent on the funky little 
exercise "Ain't Nuthin' in the World," to lackluster on a version of Aretha 
Franklin's "Until You Come Back," a track that flounders because it's too tame 
and faithful to the original. CONNIE JOHNSON CONNIE JOHNSON

Photo, Miki Howard . . . stylish vocalist, spotty performances. REGINA BELLE 
"Stay With Me." Columbia ** 1/2: Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor) 
to five (a classic). Put Belle up against any of the other new breed of black 
female singers on the scene today and she won't suffer by comparison. While 
she's not quite on the Anita Baker level, Belle is good enough to leave other 
talented young thoroughbreds -- from Joyce Sims and Mica Paris to D'Atra Hicks 
-- stalled at the starting gate when she wraps her formidable, velvet-edged 
vocal cords around a song that's worthy of her. This year, Belle and former 
Kool &amp; the Gang member James (J. T.) Taylor became a fixture on urban radio 
playlists with "All I Want Is Forever," a sugary-sweet, baby-it's-you love song 
that's as tough to resist as bonbons at bedtime. It helped Belle's album reach 
No. 1 on the black charts. But only a few of the other tracks on the LP rank 
with that one as a guilty pleasure. There's "Baby Come to Me," which has a 
soothing, sexy ring to it, and "What Goes Around," a sophisticated little 
vehicle that she comfortably rides around in, but most of the other tracks -- 
particularly the up-tempo ones -- are way too pedestrian. Given lushly 
orchestrated, adult-oriented ballads to interpret, this rising contender never 
fails to meet the challenge -- but the odds against her are tough when Belle 
strays from her basic strengths.

POP EYE: BUT IT WAS A BANNER YEAR FOR FOLLY AND NUTTINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK GOLDSTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Just when pop music seemed to be growing flabby and totally predictable, rock's 
wacky assortment of brawling Young Turks and eccentric '60s survivors combined 
to provide fans with another year of outrageous events and nutty behavior. 
</P>
<P>
Who's to say who pulled off the strangest stunt: 
</P>
<P>
Was it KLOS-FM's Mark &amp; Brian, who celebrated Elvis' birthday by flying to 
Memphis, where the deejays did their morning show from Graceland? (They were 
thrown out when a security guard became suspicious and spotted a hidden 
transmitter in their umbrellas.) 
</P>
<P>
Was it the pop duo Was (Not Was), which according to Hits magazine hired 
doubles to play them at a concert gig in Minneapolis while they were in Toronto 
finishing a film score? 
</P>
<P>
Or was it Guns N' Roses guitarist Izzy Stradlin, who was arrested this fall for 
urinating in the galley of an airplane on a flight from Indianapolis to Phoenix 
after he found all the restrooms occupied? 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the oddest couples of all were rock stars and their corporate sponsors. 
After saying in March that it stood "completely" behind its $5-million Madonna 
ad extravaganza, Pepsi-Cola announced on April 4 that it had dropped plans to 
run any more Madonna ads, following complaints and boycott threats by religious 
groups. Meanwhile, the Who's Pete Townshend, a self-confessed recovering 
alcoholic, played a summer tour sponsored by Miller and Budweiser breweries. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Tom Waits sued Frito-Lay, claiming the firm used a Waits 
sound-alike in a Doritos radio ad campaign. Bette Midler won $400,000 in 
damages from the ad agency that used an ex-Midler back-up singer to mimic her 
voice in a Mercury Sable commercial. And most wondrous of all: MTV, which had 
refused to air Neil Young's "This Note's for You" video, claiming it contained 
too many product plugs, proceeded to give the banned video its Video of the 
Year award this fall. 
</P>
<P>
Any way you look at it, 1989 was a banner year for pop follies. To celebrate 
the music world's clown princes, our yearly roundup of dubious achievements, 
inglorious moments and show-biz misadventures: 
</P>
<P>
SLIM JIMS OF THE YEAR: According to the Washington Post, several flabby members 
of Bon Jovi, namely bassist Alec Such and drummer Tico Torres, underwent 
painful liposuction treatment after image-conscious bandleader Jon Bon Jovi 
reportedly told his group-mates to either shape up or ship out. 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION OF THE YEAR: The 2 Live Crew, a Florida-based rap group known for 
their sexually explicit lyrics, signed an endorsement deal to tout Homeboy 
condoms for the Boston-based Custom Condom firm, which in return included 
Homeboy condoms in the group's albums and tapes. 
</P>
<P>
ROCK MANAGER OF THE YEAR: San Francisco Giants manager Roger Craig received a 
host of congratulatory telegrams after his team's playoff victory, including 
one from the Grateful Dead: "I didn't know anything about them," Craig said. "I 
thought they were a funeral home." 
</P>
<P>
NUPTIALS OF THE YEAR: When pop performer Mojo Nixon married his longtime 
girlfriend this summer, the couple tied the knot at a San Diego go-cart track. 
They exchanged vows through bullhorns and took the traditional "wedding lap" in 
go-carts after being showered by balloons reading "I Married a Big Foot." 
</P>
<P>
LAWSUIT OF THE YEAR: Ex-Beatle Ringo Starr won a permanent injunction last 
month from a federal judge blocking the release of a 1987 solo album, claiming 
he and other musicians recorded it while drunk. (Starr recently underwent detox 
treatment for alcoholism.) 
</P>
<P>
GOLDEN GLOVES OF THE YEAR: To Motley Crue's Vince Neil, who punched Guns N' 
Roses' Izzy Stradlin backstage at the MTV Awards this fall, prompting Izzy to 
respond: "Fortunately Vince is a powder puff and can't do much damage." 
</P>
<P>
SEANCE OF THE YEAR: The seventh L.A. Guitar Show featured a first-ever Rock 
Seance, with the intention of contacting such dead pop legends as Elvis, Duane 
Allman, John Lennon and Buddy Holly. No tables shook, though two spectators 
claimed they felt Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix speaking through them. 
</P>
<P>
IKE TURNER ARREST OF THE YEAR: Ike Turner, whose long string of drug busts 
began in 1970, was arrested again last May by West Hollywood police for 
possession of rock cocaine. The bust came shortly after Turner appeared on 
Arsenio Hall's TV show, claiming most of his arrests had been caused by police 
mistaking baking soda for cocaine. (Hall responded: "Ike, what are you doing 
snorting baking soda?") 
</P>
<P>
MICHAEL JACKSON DISGUISE OF THE YEAR: To the Gloved One himself, who was asked 
to leave a jewelry store in Simi Valley last spring when employees became 
suspicious of a customer wearing a wig with a phony mustache and false teeth. 
When a security guard took him outside the store, the pop star peeled off his 
mustache and said: "I'm in disguise. I'm Michael Jackson." 
</P>
<P>
FASHION TREND OF THE YEAR: Japanese teens have become such huge rap fans that 
they don't just wear Fila warm-up suits and Air Jordan sneakers. A Los Angeles 
Herald-Examiner fashion story last summer reported that they go to rap clubs 
with the ultimate fashion statement -- they paint their faces black. 
</P>
<P>
VISIONARY OF THE YEAR: Asked about his video channel's programming strategy, 
then-MTV chief Lee Masters told GQ magazine: "We think 'stupid' is a great part 
of what we do, and I say that in a very positive sense. I think stupid is 
wonderful today. . . . If you're a 17-year-old, you still like cars, you still 
like girls and you still like rock 'n' roll -- even if you're a Young 
Republican kid. And I think stupid is part of that. It's a universal." 
</P>
<P>
PROMOTION OF THE YEAR: The always-irreverent Rhino Records organized a "Day of 
the Dead" promotion in October where the store offered a $1 discount on any 
album made by a band with a deceased musician, complete with the ad slogan: "No 
record's a stiff at Rhino." 
</P>
<P>
HUMBLE ROCK STAR OF THE YEAR: When Jon Bon Jovi was slapped with a trespassing 
summons after sneaking onto the Wollman ice-skating rink in Central Park with 
his girlfriend last summer, Rolling Stone reported he repeatedly complained to 
security guards: "I know I'm trespassing. I'm Bon Jovi. Do you know me? Do you 
have kids? They know me." 
</P>
<P>
FRIENDLY RIVAL OF THE YEAR: Badmouthing CBS chief exec Larry Tisch's move to 
sell CBS Records to Sony for a measly $2 billion in 1988, Geffen Records 
chairman David Geffen told The Times earlier this year: "I just wish Larry 
Tisch would sell me something." 
</P>
<P>
ALBUM TITLE OF THE YEAR: Playfully hyping a new compilation of cuts from bands 
signed to its label, Restless Records called the anthology: "Only 39,999,999 
Behind 'Thriller.' " 
</P>
<P>
CHAUVINIST OF THE YEAR: Slick Rick, who explained in Spin magazine the attitude 
behind his new song, "Treat Her Like a Prostitute," by saying: "Say there's a 
girl that you like a lot, but you don't know nothing about her. The best way to 
see if she's a nice girl or a tramp is to treat her like a tramp first. If you 
treat her good first, you'll never know."

PALMS' QUIRKY MUSEUM OF JURASSIC TECHNOLOGY OFFERS CURIOSER AND CURIOSER 
DISPLAYS, LIKELY TO PROMPT MORE QUESTIONS THAN THEY ANSWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID WHARTON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The learner must be led always from familiar objects toward the unfamiliar, 
guided along, as it were, a chain of flowers into the mysteries of life. 
</P>
<P>
 -- pamphlet from the Museum of Jurassic Technology 
</P>
<P>
An In-N-Out Burger recently opened on Venice Boulevard, yet another attraction 
along the main drag of Palms, a West Los Angeles neighborhood of apartment 
buildings and condominiums south of the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
Already gracing the boulevard were several video rental shops, a discount tire 
store and a janitorial supply outlet. And, in a storefront of somber maroon and 
green, the Museum of Jurassic Technology. 
</P>
<P>
A museum hardly seems fitting here, among hamburger stands and strip malls. A 
museum suggests permanence and that, too, seems out of place. People -- many of 
them renters -- arrive in Palms only to move on. Small businesses tend to come 
and go. 
</P>
<P>
Yet there is some sense to the location of the Museum of Jurassic Technology, 
if only because this odd little institution is as unlikely as its surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
The Jurassic defies classification. Or, perhaps, it demands classification. A 
large part of the experience of walking through this place is trying to decide 
what it is. 
</P>
<P>
"By and large, we prefer not to describe it," says owner and curator David 
Wilson, offering no help in a polite tone of voice. 
</P>
<P>
In the simplest, most tangible terms, the museum consists of 1,500 square feet 
of commercial space. 
</P>
<P>
There is a lobby with pamphlets and souvenirs and, subsequently, an 
introductory slide show for newcomers. Wilson often plays accordion -- doleful 
Italian standards -- by the front door. 
</P>
<P>
The remaining space is dedicated to 30 or so painstakingly prepared exhibits 
that offer quasi-religious objects, skeletal remains and exotic displays. 
</P>
<P>
A prominent, rectangular cabinet features corpse-like masks. By peering through 
prisms at the far end of the case, visitors see a hologram of two hands 
suspended above the masks that appear to perform sign language. A man's voice 
whispers from a small speaker: 
</P>
<P>
 "...The amber filters were five times as good and they were expensive, five 
times as expensive ...

<P>
 " ... at that point, I looked the man in the eye for the first time and saw 
that he was a Cyclops ..." 
</P>
<P>
The exhibit is untitled. There is no explanatory text. 
</P>
<P>
 A few feet away stands an impressive glass case -- the museum's focal point -- 
containing pictures, models and charts regarding the "Deprong Mori" bat of 
South America. A recorded message explains that the Deprong Mori emits extreme 
ultraviolet rays, as compared to the sonic emissions of normal bats. The 
Deprong Mori is thereby enabled to fly through solid objects such as tree 
trunks and thatched huts, we are told. Frenchman Bernard Maston is credited 
with early studies of this phenomenon. The exhibit demonstrates how British 
scientist Donald R. Griffith later trapped one of these bats in a lead wall he 
erected amid the jungle of the Tripsicum Plateau. 
</P>
<P>
Documentation is available in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
"We're definitely interested in phenomenon that other natural history museums 
seem unwilling to present," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
The museum's general statement begins: "The Museum of Jurassic Technology in 
Los Angeles, California, is an educational institution dedicated to the 
advancement of knowledge and the public appreciation of the Lower Jurassic." 
</P>
<P>
 Webster's Dictionary defines Jurassic as "the second period of the Mesozoic 
Era . . . characterized by the dominance of dinosaurs and the appearance of 
flying reptiles and birds." 
</P>
<P>
There is little mention of dinosaurs or flying reptiles in the museum. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
Wilson, 43, grew up in Denver, and says he wasn't like other children. 
</P>
<P>
"Rather than playing ball in the park, I was always at the natural history 
museum." 
</P>
<P>
After studying urban entomology at Kalamazoo College in Michigan, he earned a 
degree in film from CalArts in Valencia. Soon after, his family house in 
Colorado burned to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing to go back to," he says. 
</P>
<P>
So he remained in Los Angeles and established a company that provides animation 
and miniature models for motion pictures. A small man with wire-rim glasses and 
a close-cropped beard, Wilson also worked on installation art pieces. 
</P>
<P>
One day, he put a sheet of clear plastic over an artwork to protect it from 
dust. Inspiration struck. 
</P>
<P>
"It hit me that what I wanted to be doing was making a museum," he says. "The 
ideas for half of these exhibits, for the name of the museum and how it would 
be presented to the public came to me in a half-hour." 
</P>
<P>
Wilson's wife, Diana, an artist and anthropologist, joined in the quest. 
Friends donated display items and money. Much of the funding came out of the 
Wilsons' pockets. Last year, in September, the museum opened. 
</P>
<P>
"We're quite committed," Wilson says. "We feel a sense that what we're doing is 
important and valuable." 
</P>
<P>
Artifacts are displayed in rooms of gray carpet and muted colors. Some exhibits 
feature recorded messages and push-button demonstrations. Informative texts are 
mounted on the walls. 
</P>
<P>
Many exhibits deal with objects that are appropriate for a natural history 
museum. A collection of moths, a sloth skull, a stuffed bird. 
</P>
<P>
Other exhibits are peculiar. 
</P>
<P>
A glass case contains, according to its sign, a "Zinc-inlaid black onyx box 
used for holding sacrificial human hearts. For as yet unknown reasons, the 
remains of dried sacrificial blood appear phosphorescent when viewed through 
polarizing material like that at the front of the case." 
</P>
<P>
At the front of the case, a large lens is cantilevered above a display stand 
that bears a card, "Specimen Temporarily Removed for Study." 
</P>
<P>
A nearby wall offers a selection of antlers and an odd-looking horn. The 
accompanying explanation suggests that the horn grew from a woman's head. 
</P>
<P>
A small room near the rear of the museum is roped off. A sign says that the 
exhibit is under construction. The legend above the door promises that the room 
will someday house an exhibit titled "Central and South America (including the 
Galapagos Islands)." 
</P>
<P>
And a mixture of sounds washes over the rooms: the curator's accordion, 
14th-Century religious music from one exhibit, sounds like a howling dog from 
another exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
Wilson has plans to expand the Jurassic to include a botanical garden, and to 
rent a larger space to accommodate more exhibits. He wants a big, densely 
packed hall, like museums of the 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 " ... the most ingenious Museum of its kind I've ever seen," states an 
unattributed advertisement in the museum flyer. 
</P>
<P>
Peter Lime wandered into the museum one day recently. 
</P>
<P>
"I heard a guy playing accordion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The Mar Vista man spent a short time looking the place over. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't know what to make of it," he said. "I get the impression that 
someone's keeping something from me." 
</P>
<P>
On a busy evening not long ago, several visitors became visibly angry while 
viewing the exhibits. People have called the museum a fraud, Wilson says. 
People have threatened to sue. There is a sign-in book at the entrance and 
several guests have, after walking through the museum, returned to scratch out 
their names and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
The museum mainstream hasn't exactly embraced the project either. No one at the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History's front office had heard of it. A 
spokesman for the Los Angeles County Museum of Science and Industry said he has 
seen the museum's facade and thought it might be a front for a betting parlor. 
</P>
<P>
Yet the Jurassic has attracted enough visitors -- at $2.50 for the entrance fee 
-- and enough donors to pay the rent. People occasionally buy souvenirs and 
literature on sale in the lobby, including issues of a journal called "The 
Skeptical Inquirer" and a book titled "Deviant Science." 
</P>
<P>
"It's been a crazy endeavor," says Wilson, who continues to keep the place 
alive with money he makes from the movie business. "But it has never entered my 
mind that it is not a good thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
And Palms has, in its own way, accepted the Jurassic. The guys at Manuel's Body 
Shop say they are too busy to pay much attention to the strange neighbor. A 
woman at the print shop says she's used to new businesses popping up along 
Venice Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
"I watched them move in there," says Howard Steinberg, owner of Armand's 
Discount Appliance, across the street. "At first they painted the building an 
ugly blue. Then they changed it. I was pleased to see the new paint job." 
</P>
<P>
 The Museum of Jurassic Technology, 9341 Venice Blvd., Palms, is open from 5 to 
9 p.m. on Thursdays and noon to 6 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Admission is 
$2.50, $2 for students and senior citizens. Children are free. For more

EVERYTHING GOES OVER BIG AT R.J.'S, WHERE EMPHASIS IS ON QUANTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
You may have seen the ad in this very publication: Two dudes in cowboy clothes 
waving barbecued ribs at each other, Dodge City showdown fashion. What's going 
on here? A sudden gust of exoticism at R.J.'s the Rib Joint, that's what. 
</P>
<P>
Rib exoticism, I mean. The world already knows that R.J.'s is distinctive to 
the max in just about every other way. It has sawdust-strewn floors and 
belt-driven overhead fans, illuminated panels representing Tiffany stained 
glass windows, and a piano player in a loft over the vast bar. 
</P>
<P>
The collection of liquor behind that bar reaches almost to the ceiling, and the 
bartenders keep a library ladder to reach the rarer volumes. (It's going to be 
a bad place to stand in an earthquake.) Opposite the vast liquor bar is a vast 
salad bar, and near the end of it you can see what looks like a 
chocolate-covered waste basket, which turns out to be an actual chocolate cake 
of awesome size. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, awesome size is the main motif here. It's a little hard on Beverly 
Hills' image of careless wealth to see so many people thriftily carrying home 
aluminum foil doggie swans full of leftovers, but the reason is that they 
couldn't possibly finish the portions they were served. 
</P>
<P>
This would be paradise if the food were terrific, but R.J.'s tends to 
concentrate on hugeness rather than quality. Even the things it's proudest of 
aren't necessarily so good. Despite a money-back guarantee and about 15 things 
to put on it, the clay-baked potato is essentially bizarre. The oven's clay 
coating has kept all moisture from escaping, so the potato's damp inside, 
rather like a boiled potato with gray skin. 
</P>
<P>
The desserts include that vast chocolate cake, which looks as if somebody had 
just stacked one cake on top of another. It happens to be delicious, a classic 
devil's food cake that lies on the plate like a fallen redwood, but the other 
desserts aren't necessarily so good. The apple pie may be about four inches 
tall, but the apple slices in it are mixed with a lot of doughy filler. 
</P>
<P>
And now to the ribs. With a place so vast, I suppose there will always be a 
problem of quality control. Whatever sort of barbecue you order here, there's 
about one chance in four it will come to the table at room temperature, and 
some parts of the meat may be slightly carbonized. 
</P>
<P>
For me, though, the real problem with the barbecue here is the sauce -- the 
same sauce goes on everything. Evidently R.J.'s regular customers don't mind, 
but I find it rather drab, thick and sweet but almost without aroma. Here is 
where Layne Wootten, the other dude in the shoot-out photo, enters the picture. 
</P>
<P>
Wootten is a barbecue chef who got his start with R.J.'s owner Bob Morris and 
went on to be known as barbecuer to the stars: Stevie Wonder, Willie Nelson, 
and as he likes to point out, various outlaw motorcycle gangs. In his 
ten-gallon hat and handlebar mustache he strolls around R.J.'s mildly handing 
out samples of his own style barbecue, which you can order as an alternative to 
R.J.'s usual barbecue. Things may still come lukewarm and everything, but the 
sauces are mostly as far from neutral as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
For instance, the Texas Wild Boar Ribs, said to be ribs from real (domestic) 
wild boar, have a sharp, peppery sauce with an aggressively herbal aroma. No, 
herbal isn't the word, it's like acacia or eucalyptus leaves, probably from the 
balsamic vinegar in it (the other ingredients are molasses and Lone Star Beer 
-- oddly, Lone Star is one of the few beers R.J.'s doesn't stock). A lot of 
people will find this one too wild, but when it comes to raw, raspy, tough-guy 
barbecue sauces, this is one of the top contenders. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some of Wootten's sauces are so sweet they make R.J.'s 
regular sauce seem austere. The Tennessee Candy Apple Ribs are literally as 
sweet as candy. The bright red sauce, flavored with applejack, sticks to your 
fingers like glue. There are some lurid pink candied apple slices resting on 
top of the slab of baby pork ribs. 
</P>
<P>
And the Juicy Red Watermelon Pork Ribs are topped with what seems to be chunks 
of pickled watermelon rind, and a sauce that tastes like liquid candy cane. 
These Watermelon ribs are not at all smoky, and the meat gives the effect of 
the Cantonese appetizer char siu. 
</P>
<P>
After these, the nice and smoky Rattlesnake Beef Ribs are relatively 
restrained. However, their arresting sauce tastes like apple butter dosed with 
a little vinegar and a fair bit of red pepper, plus some garlic and maybe 
cinnamon too. The Texas, the Tennessee and the Watermelon ribs are so exotic I 
doubt I could have them two days in a row, but I might be able to handle two 
straight days of Rattlesnake Ribs. 
</P>
<P>
Finally there's kalbi, Korean-style beef ribs sliced crosswise and prepared in 
a relatively sober soy marinade. Wootten says the kalbi is his personal 
favorite, showing that despite his watermelon mania and handlebar mustache he 
has his booted feet on the ground after all. 
</P>
<P>
Suggested dishes: rattlesnake beef ribs, $15.95; Texas wild boar ribs, $16.95; 
kalbi beef ribs, $14.95; chocolate cake, $6.95. 
</P>
<P>

Open for lunch and dinner from 11:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday,

DANCING TO HIS OWN BEAT; 
</P>
<P>
AFTER A MID-LIFE CRISIS, FRED STRICKLER HAS FOUND SATISFACTION AS A TEACHER AND 
CHOREOGRAPHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SALLI STEVENSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Four years ago dancer/choreographer Fred Strickler was feeling desperate about 
his life. 
</P>
<P>
"I wasn't happy or satisfied with how I was operating in the world, even though 
I was having very good success as an artist," said the 46-year-old former Jazz 
Tap Ensemble dancer who is noted for his silken approach to percussive rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
"People were bursting into applause, having a great time and everyone loved it 
but me. There were times," he said, "when I would go on stage and I would be in 
a rage. I finally said to myself, 'What's wrong with this picture?' " 
</P>
<P>
Strickler -- who followed his bachelor of science and education degree in dance 
from Ohio State University in 1966 by combining teaching at UC Riverside with a 
career in professional dance in Bella Lewitzky's company and later as a 
co-founder of the experimental modern Eyes Wide Open Dance Theatre (1974) and 
Jazz Tap Ensemble (1979) -- was unable to pin down the exact reasons for his 
mid-life crisis. 
</P>
<P>
He left Jazz Tap Ensemble in 1986 because he felt the need to do his own work 
and to perform modern dance. He also explored the Hindu beliefs of 
Krishnamurti, the works of the late mythologist Joseph Campbell and then 
learned practical ways to change his life through a self-help program called 
Life Spring. 
</P>
<P>
"For me it was discovering how to make my life as a teacher and performer work. 
I've found that what works for me is to be open and to respond to things, not 
to just react to them," said the current chairman of the UC Riverside Dance 
Department. He will present "my very first evening of my choreography" with 
works that include tap, modern and ballet at Santa Monica College's Studio 
Stage, Jan. 5 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
"I now have the tools for dealing with myself and dealing with my 
relationships," Strickler said. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, his dances "are not literal. They are abstractions, metaphors." 
</P>
<P>
A duet titled "Between Friends" exemplifies the way Strickler uses responsive 
feelings to build a dance choreographically. He created the piece for himself 
and Victoria Keonig of L.A. Chamber Ballet, and it will be danced by Keonig and 
former Laura Dean dancer Paul Maillard at Santa Monica College in a program 
that includes three premieres and live music. 
</P>
<P>
"I rarely start out with a topic, but something emerges. When Vickie asked me 
to do this, we didn't know each other very well. I didn't have any specific 
ideas. I was terrified about the idea of working with a ballerina of her 
caliber, because I don't consider myself a ballet dancer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Strickler and Keonig started the piece with "no music and no agenda -- no 
ideas. We worked in the studio for three or four months and I feel the dance 
was really about getting to know each other, and those movements came together 
to illuminate that friendship." 
</P>
<P>
Strickler's approach to his choreography extends to his teaching method, a 
Socratic sharing of ideas in an open forum. 
</P>
<P>
"When I walk into a choreography class the first thing I write on the board is 
that 'there are no rules,' " he said. "I think good teaching is the empowering 
of the student, not the overpowering." 
</P>
<P>
Strickler encourages his students to discover their choreographic bent by 
creating dance for 45 minutes without ceasing motion. 
</P>
<P>
"It's an exercise and there can be no stillness, only motion. After they get 
exhausted and run out of ideas, and they don't know what to do next, that's 
when the discovery begins, that's when the body knowledge which is very deep 
and nonverbal begins to emerge and some fascinating things occur. This is about 
problem solving, discovering new possibilities. You show students that this is 
a way of going deeper into themselves, going ahead with their ideas, trusting 
themselves and experiencing success," he said. "I feel I've succeeded if my 
students discover what their deep feelings are, their sensations and their 
sensibilities." 
</P>
<P>
Strickler treats his audiences in the same fashion. "I think it's important to 
make dances that don't close out my audience. I'm not interested in being 
didactic. I try to make dances that allow people to find themselves in my work. 
To me that's what dance is about, communication through movement."

GETTING YOUR IRISH UP ON THE STAGE; 
</P>
<P>
IN 'BEIN' WITH BEHAN,' MICHAEL KAVANAGH PAYS GLAD TRIBUTE TO A FELLOW DUBLINER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It has taken over 10 years, but Michael L. Kavanagh finally has Brendan Behan 
exactly where he wants him: on stage. 
</P>
<P>
"He was a great influence on my life," said Kavanagh, who pays tribute to the 
late Irish writer in his one-man show, "Bein' with Behan" (at Van Nuys' West 
End Playhouse through Feb. 4). "We also have very similar backgrounds. We both 
come from the slums of Dublin. I wasn't in the Irish Republican Army as he was, 
but I left school at 14 years of age and apprenticed as a house painter -- 
where I worked alongside Brendan's father, Stephen." 
</P>
<P>
Emigrating to America in 1964 to study jazz trumpet, Kavanagh spent time in 
Boston and Las Vegas (often supporting himself as a bartender), before 
gravitating to acting. In 1976, he came up with the idea for this show. 
</P>
<P>
"At first, the estate and Mrs. Behan were rather cautious about it," Kavanagh 
said, alluding to the inevitable inclusion of Behan's excesses -- boozing, 
brawling, multiple arrests and sexual escapades (he died at 41 in 1964 of 
alcoholism) -- in such a portrait. Finally, after years of slogging through 
rewrites and negotiations with the estate and Behan publisher Samuel French, 
Kavanagh was granted full rights for America, Canada and Australia. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting monologue -- originally six hours long, now whittled to just 
under 2 1/2 -- is largely supported by Behan's own words. Kavanagh's sources 
include Behan's biographies ("The Quare Fellow" and "Confessions of an Irish 
Rebel"), plays ("The Borstal Boy" and "The Hostage"), little-known books 
("Brendan Behan's New York" and "Brendan Behan's Ireland"), plus stacks of 
newspaper articles, poems and songs. 
</P>
<P>
When Kavanagh finished the research, "I said, 'I don't want to hear another 
word about Brendan Behan. I'm sick of him!' " 
</P>
<P>
But he got over it. Sharing the stage with his trusty typewriter and a glass of 
Guinness beer ("That was Brendan's brand; I prefer Budweiser"), Kavanagh slips 
into character -- and into massive memory overload. "Sometimes your mind splits 
in half," he said, chuckling. "You're telling one story, thinking, 'God, what's 
the next anecdote?' Then you realize it's not a story at all, but a bloody song 
that's coming up. Then suddenly, the sound of that tells me where I have to go 
to get to the next story." 
</P>
<P>
In 1988, "Behan" made its debut at the Jimson Theatre in Hollywood ("We lost 
our shirts, but it was OK 'cause we got wonderful reviews"). Kavanagh is now 
hoping that good press will help support runs in New York, Chicago and maybe a 
college tour. The material, he says, is both entertaining and timely. "Brendan 
once said, 'Ireland, I'm afraid, will never be at peace.' And so while it makes 
my heart heavy to see in the papers what's going on in Ireland, it also makes 
this show very relevant." 
</P>
<P>
Although he admits to a fondness for "working-class" writers like Behan and 
Sean O'Casey (dismissing Oscar Wilde, George Bernard Shaw and W.B. Yeats as 
"bluebloods"), Kavanagh, 49, feels he's presented a balanced account. "What 
strikes me most about Brendan was his great love for humanity, his kindness," 
he said earnestly. "And he was very honest. In this play, he doesn't spare the 
British, he doesn't spare the IRA, and he doesn't spare himself. 
</P>
<P>
"Something would happen when he'd have one drink too many. Suddenly he'd turn 
from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, get rather aggressive and argumentative. Of 
course, I show that inevitable decline at the end. But what you may have never 
seen before is the private, sensitive, vulnerable Brendan Behan, totally 
removed from the popular image of the loudmouthed, rip-roaring, two-fisted, 
hard-drinking Irish playwright-drunk brawler." 
</P>
<P>
As an actor, Kavanagh -- with his pink skin, twinkling eyes and deep brogue -- 
knows only too well the limitations of cultural typecasting. 
</P>
<P>
"Being Irish in this business works for you some of the time," he said slowly. 
"Sometimes it works against you. With all due respect to Barry Fitzgerald, I 
think that all Irish actors have to fight the image." He mimicked Fitzgerald's 
sing-song movie-priest delivery in "Going My Way." "Barry Fitzgerald himself 
didn't talk like that. It's Hollywood's concept of what an Irishman was. And 
it's not right." 
</P>
<P>
He shook his head quizzically. "The funny thing is, when I go home to Dublin 
and drink in pubs where the people don't necessarily know me, they think I'm a 
Yank." 
</P>
<P>
"Bein' With Behan" plays Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. through Feb. 4 at the 
West End Playhouse, 7446 Van Nuys Blvd., Van Nuys. (818) 904-0444. Tickets are 
$15.

Before the Palo Verde nuclear plant was licensed in 1985, the U.S. nuclear 
industry built 92 reactors, each one different and needing to go through the 
detailed, time-consuming and costly scrutiny of regulators. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Verde was the first of what was hoped would be a standardized design that 
utilities could, in effect, order from a catalogue. That "cookie cutter" 
approach is used by the French and Japanese nuclear industries. 
</P>
<P>
Palo Verde still is a "state-of-the-art facility," said NRC regional spokesman 
Gregory N. Cook. "The plant was built by people who did a superb job. But 
management did not convert the organization to the kind of staff, the kind of 
organization you need to operate a nuclear plant in today's environment." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the $9.3-billion plant has been plagued by problems that earned it 
a ranking as the nation's 19th worst and worst in terms of management from 
Public Citizen, a watchdog group. In addition, the Nuclear Regulatory 
Commission has fined the Arizona Nuclear Power Project $810,000 since 1983 for 
deficiencies in the plant, which ANPP operates, and sent a special diagnostic 
team in November. And an industry accreditation board put nine out of 10 
training programs on probation in June. 
</P>
<P>
"Palo Verde 1 has fallen to the bottom of the industry," Joan Claybrook, 
president of the Critical Mass Energy Project of Public Citizen, a Ralph 
Nader-founded group, said in May. "It's time they closed that nuclear lemon 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Problems have shut down the three reactors almost as often as they've been 
running and two units have been down since early March, forcing the consortium 
of utilities that own it to buy power elsewhere during a record heat wave to 
serve their 4 million customers in four states. 
</P>
<P>
"The mentality of building and the mentality of operating are two totally 
distinctive things," William F. Conway, who was lured away from Florida Power 
&amp; Light Co. in May to oversee Palo Verde, said in June. "It is almost like 
reading two different prayer books. Operations is another type of religion." 
</P>
<P>
According to Arizona Corporation Commission records, Unit 1 was in operation 
62% of the time in 1986, 49% in 1987, 62% in 1988 and 22% in 1989 -- not at all 
since early in March. Unit 2, which came on line in late 1986, was producing 
power 77% of the time in 1987, 63% in 1988, and less than half of 1989. Unit 3, 
the newest reactor, was up for 95% of 1988, producing more power than any other 
unit in the world. But it has been on line only 16% of 1989 -- not at all since 
early March. 
</P>
<P>
The 1,270-megawatt, pressurized-water plant's units have missed a total of 639 
days of operation this year. Scheduled refueling and various mechanical 
problems have kept Units 1 and 3 down since early March, and Unit 2 has been up 
and down since February. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC fines include $250,000 in September for 13 alleged violations 
discovered after Unit 3 shut itself down in March. So many things went wrong 
during the automatic shutdown the NRC ordered a special inspection. 
</P>
<P>
The shutdown occurred because of a power-line failure. Ensuing problems 
included loss of power to two primary coolant pumps, failure of a fast-transfer 
system, relief valves that froze and wouldn't release steam on the non-nuclear 
side of the plant, and loss of some radiation monitors and emergency lights. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC said in April that equipment failures leading to the shutdown could 
have been avoided if problems were fixed when they were found, some as long as 
four years ago: "This event is symptomatic of management's failure to set a 
standard which demands that plant problems be recognized and fixed." 
</P>
<P>
The agency also has complained that top managers didn't visit critical areas 
often enough, a problem that is being addressed, Cook said. "They have 
developed a formal program of getting management on site and into the plant, 
but as of a couple of months ago the plan hadn't been fully implemented. We 
were a little disappointed that it hadn't gotten farther along." 
</P>
<P>
Evaluations like the one begun in November, he said, are conducted when "NRC 
senior management has substantial questions about the overall management of the 
operation. . . . We are looking toward performance -- what works and what 
doesn't." The team's report is due in about March. 
</P>
<P>
Other fines were $250,000 in December, 1988, over operation and radiation; 
$100,000 in April, 1988, over engineering and operation; $100,000 in May, 1986, 
for security problems; $50,000 in October, 1985, for deficiencies in 
monitoring; and $60,000 in 1983 for lapses in quality assurance and 
record-keeping. That's "a fairly poor enforcement record" and "very high" 
fines, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
The criteria for Public Citizen's ratings included such things as forced 
shutdowns, worker exposure to radiation, violation of NRC regulations, cost of 
maintenance and scores on annual NRC assessments. 
</P>
<P>
Conway has set in motion a plan for immediate improvements at Palo Verde, said 
plant spokesman Don Andrews. He brought in new people to raise the level of 
management experience, began improving accident investigation, issued a set of 
"standards and expectations" for all employees and moved to "increase the sense 
of urgency" in responding to problems uncovered by the NRC. 
</P>
<P>
The National Academy for Nuclear Training, which cited lack of attendance among 
problems when it put plant programs on probation, restored accreditation in 
October. Only radiation protection training had been deemed adequate. 
</P>
<P>
The NRC has been encouraged by what has happened since Conway took over, Cook 
said. "You have to expect in dealing with an organization of that size where 
there have been institutional problems, which certainly there have been, it is 
going to take time to turn it around." 
</P>
<P>
In its annual assessment on Nov. 24, the NRC found overall performance to be 
"satisfactory" and "directed toward safe facility operation." Performance 
slipped somewhat in the first six months of the reporting period ending Oct. 31 
but showed improvement in the remaining six months, the assessment said. 
</P>
<P>
NRC Regional Administrator J. M. Martin, in a letter accompanying the report, 
said he expected plant performance to continue improving if management 
implements planned improvements and corrections. But he cited several areas of 
"continued weakness," such as engineering, quality assurance and other 
"problem-finding" functions. 
</P>
<P>
"The sign of a healthy organization is that they find their own problems," he 
said. "They don't wait for them to be self-revealed, or for them to be found by 
regulators. What I'm particularly looking for is that they're finding the bulk 
of their problems. They aren't doing that yet." 
</P>
<P>
Conway said the NRC report was "right on target," and that he is generally 
pleased with the progress at Palo Verde. "I'm relatively impatient by nature. I 
would like for us to be moving faster," he said. "But I am generally satisfied 
with where we're going at this point in time."

FARM AID PROGRAM OF '88: 'DROUGHT' PAYMENTS EVEN IN WET AREAS; 
</P>
<P>
STUDY: AMERICA'S 1988 DROUGHT CAPTURED ATTENTION EVERYWHERE, BUT ESPECIALLY IN 
WASHINGTON WHERE POLITICIANS PUSHED THROUGH THE LARGEST DISASTER-RELIEF MEASURE 
IN U.S. HISTORY. THE ASSOCIATED PRESS TRACKED WHERE THE $3.9 BILLION WENT.

<P>
The $3.9-billion drought-relief program of 1988, hailed as the salvation of 
small farms devastated by a prolonged dry spell, became much more than that. It 
was an election-year windfall for thousands of farmers who collected millions 
of dollars in compensation for normal quirks of nature. 
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press study conducted over seven months found that the 
drought-relief program paid cash to farmers for everything from hail-damaged 
kiwi fruit in California to heat-stressed radicchio in Massachusetts, from 
water-logged tomatoes in New Jersey to washed-out bird-seed crops in Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
The payments went far beyond the legislation's intent -- to save Midwestern 
grain farms from bankruptcy. It was an effort -- supported by almost everyone 
-- that simply grew and grew and grew. 
</P>
<P>
At each step in the legislative process, the program was broadened. Congress 
began with a bill to aid drought victims. The lawmakers added hail damage to 
the relief categories, then flood losses. 
</P>
<P>
Next came "heat," added by the Agriculture Department. 
</P>
<P>
By the time the checks were being written at the county level, farmers elected 
to administer federal agriculture programs locally were approving claims for 
common problems such as insects, sand, wind, cold and fungus, even "ineffective 
herbicide." 
</P>
<P>
None of those conditions should have been eligible, administrators in 
Washington say. Nothing in federal procedures, however, requires paper work to 
be forwarded to higher officials for routine approval or checking. 
</P>
<P>
By the end of October, about a quarter of all U.S. farmers had collected on 
damage to most of 506 eligible crops and just about any kind of weather in 49 
states. The taxpayers' tab ran to $3.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
"We lucked out last year on account of the boys up north," said Travis 
Turnipseed, a Levelland, Tex., cotton farmer whose crops have been hit by hail 
in 23 of the last 28 years. He collected cash for hail damage the first time in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
Loose regulations and lax enforcement of them were the major reasons for the 
government generosity, the AP found by examining federal records in 14 states 
through the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
The politics of 1988 and the media attention the drought received -- a steady 
bombardment of print and electronic images of shriveled cornstalks and dusty 
fields -- were factors in the swift passage of the nation's largest disaster 
relief measure to date. 
</P>
<P>
"Being an election year, there were a lot of concessions to farmers," said Dan 
Otto, a professor at Iowa State University. "(Politicians) were trying to get 
recognized as a friend of agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
In the end, drought relief meant a one-time bonus for thousands of farmers in 
parts of the country that in 1988 generally enjoyed good harvests that fetched 
high prices and wouldn't have qualified as disaster areas. These included parts 
of California, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, Maryland and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
Although some producers appeared to have been ineligible -- some had more than 
the maximum annual income allowed, for example -- their requests for aid were 
approved anyway. Most farmers simply took advantage of a generous program. As 
tough as farming is, they'd be fools not to take what was offered, they said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was there, so I took it," said Melvin Przilas, a wheat and corn farmer in 
the Texas Panhandle who collected $2,254 because hail and Russian wheat aphids 
damaged crops on his 1,265-acre irrigated farm, which grosses between $300,000 
and $400,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
Government officials say they did the best they could with a rushed program. 
Loopholes were narrowed the a smaller, $1-billion drought-relief program that 
was passed this year. 
</P>
<P>
"Some farmers just got grandfathered in, that's true," said Dan Shaw, deputy 
administrator of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, which 
administers payment programs for the Agriculture Department. "What percentage, 
we don't know, but that is part of the beast, I guess, that was created. 
Whenever you do this for the whole nation, there are some people that luck 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers did better than just luck out. They profited from 
"triple-dipping," by collecting on crop insurance as well as drought aid for 
damaged crops, then re-planting for a successful harvest -- all perfectly legal 
under the 1988 program. 
</P>
<P>
Relief payments in several states also went to banks, corporations, investment 
firms, churches and local governments such as the city of Littlefield, Tex., 
despite regulations designed to reserve the benefits for small farmers. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, corporations ineligible for drought relief because of the 
$2-million limit on a farm's gross annual income collected anyway because they 
owned a stake in a farm. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Fe Pacific Co., the railroad with annual revenue of $3 billion, received 
a check through its energy division. The American Cancer Society got a check, 
as did a unit of Texas A&amp;M University and the Jesuits' mid-Atlantic 
headquarters in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
Pryslak Farms of Great Meadows, N. J., a $9-million-a-year truck-farming 
operation, collected $100,000 for losses on endive, escarole and leaf lettuce 
crops because the local Agriculture Department official said he thought the 
$2-million ceiling applied only to the vegetable operation. 
</P>
<P>
Wrong, Washington officials said. The ceiling applies to revenue from all 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
For all the apparent misapplications, the program did provide crucial 
assistance to farms racked by severe drought. 
</P>
<P>
In North Dakota, the hardest-hit state, farmers lost an estimated $1.1 billion 
to the drought, but direct federal aid cut that by 36%, to $706 million. In 
Iowa the aid, calculated by the federal government at $335 million, went a long 
way, state agriculture secretary Dale Cochran said. 
</P>
<P>
Without that money, "it would have meant substantially more losses to Main 
Street," Cochran said. "Drought legislation saved businesses from having to 
close their doors." 
</P>
<P>
To examine the program, the AP interviewed agriculture experts in 21 states, 
then chose 14 states where rainfall data and drought payments were matched 
county by county in a computer database. From those results, the AP selected 
120 counties for further study. 
</P>
<P>
Farm Entitlement reports, the ASCS summaries of individual farms' participation 
in the program, were requested for about 12,000 farms in those counties under 
the Freedom of Information Act. 
</P>
<P>
Because much of the ASCS paper work never leaves the counties, reporters then 
traveled to 22 county offices in eight states to examine detailed drought 
program files for 346 specific farms, also available under the information act. 
</P>
<P>
One such farmer was Don Gresham, who raises cotton on 4,000 acres near 
Levelland. Gresham readily admitted that he and his son operate their farms 
under five names precisely because of federal payment limits -- in the case of 
drought aid, it was $100,000 per farmer. 
</P>
<P>
Because of hail damage, Gresham and his companies collected $248,662 from the 
drought program, plus $159,478 from federal crop insurance. He gambled and 
replanted the cotton acres in milo -- and made a good crop. 
</P>
<P>
According to government program formulas, Gresham grossed nearly $100,000 more 
than if he had grown cotton successfully. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be the first to tell you it worked out to a good year for me," Gresham 
said. "You can't farm without the government. You play their game." 
</P>
<P>
Among other findings of the study: 
</P>
<P>
* More than $1 billion of the $3.9 billion was spent outside the Midwest 
drought area, which was the focal point of concern. 
</P>
<P>
* In the 22 county offices visited, the AP found more than a dozen cases in 
which farmers and corporations got more than the maximum $100,000 payment by 
identifying farms in relatives' names, corporate names, partnerships or trusts. 
One California family split its 2,734-acre farm in the fertile San Joaquin 
Valley eight ways and collected $367,434 for heat damage to irrigated cotton. 
</P>
<P>
* Program rules did not consider the higher prices farmers received in 1988, 
the costs they incurred, the quality of what they grew or the value of stored 
surpluses. Vegetable farmers in particular found the system beneficial: Their 
payments for lost corn, zucchini and tomatoes included expenses they never had, 
such as the cost of harvest, sometimes 50% of their overhead. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very good payment to the vegetable producers," said James Richardson, 
the Maryland ASCS director. 
</P>
<P>
* While Congress and then-President Reagan touted drought relief as a necessity 
without which "hundreds of thousands of farmers and ranchers would have faced 
bankruptcy," the aid payments averaged only $4,683 per farmer, according to 
ASCS figures. In many of the counties studied by the AP, a few farmers 
collected payments of more than $50,000. The rest received checks for less than 
$2,500; some got less than $10. 
</P>
<P>
* Some farmers complained that they were shortchanged by the system of 
estimating crop yields, or how much would have been produced. Others were 
credited with far more produce than they would have raised in a good year. 
</P>
<P>
"When I saw what I was going to get, I wanted to smile. . . . It was like I was 
in heaven," said Peter Gibney, an Essex County, Mass., vegetable farmer who was 
paid the state average yield of 186 bushels an acre for sweet corn. He usually 
raises about 100 bushels on each acre.

MILLIONS OF TOURISTS, SHOPPERS LOOK BENEATH THE SURFACE TO DISCOVER HEART OF 
ATLANTA

Six months after opening, Underground is the new mandatory stop on the Atlanta 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
Atlantans are bringing their relatives. Yuppies from around the Southeast have 
integrated it into their weekend visits. Tourists and conventioneers ask for 
directions to it as soon as they get to town. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it's kind of a tourist trap, but it's something your out-of-town 
guests want to see," said Atlanta resident Mary Van Ehrlich. "You take them to 
the top of the Regency (Hotel), you take them to Stone Mountain and now you 
take them to Underground Atlanta. It's one of the expected stops." 
</P>
<P>
Since the shopping and entertainment complex opened June 15, as many as 7 
million people have trekked to Underground, said general manager William M. 
Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
Initial figures show only about 40% -- far less than the 70% projected -- are 
from outside metropolitan Atlanta, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
The proportion of locals to out-of-towners, however, is expected to drop during 
the traditional post-Christmas retail slump this winter, which is also a time 
when Atlanta will have its biggest conventions in town. 
</P>
<P>
But no matter where they are from, those who venture into Underground -- 
created in old storefronts that were once the heart of Atlanta before a network 
of bridges over the railroad tracks literally raised downtown one level -- are 
spending an average of $35 apiece, Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Gross sales volume for the 76 shops and pushcarts, about 22 food court vendors 
and 17 restaurants and nightclubs reached about $36 million through November, 
about 20% above projections for the Rouse Co. project. Rouse is the same 
company that developed Boston's trendy Faneuil Hall shopping area and 
Baltimore's Harborplace. 
</P>
<P>
"It's very good. But December will tell the tale because it's such an important 
month for retailers," Coleman said. 
</P>
<P>
Although none of the original shops has gone out of business, three nightclubs 
already have filed for reorganization in federal bankruptcy court -- a 
development Coleman attributed to management problems and not sales volume. 
</P>
<P>
Some of the fast food vendors also have complained that their sales have 
dropped since the summer boom, although other merchants say they had expected a 
slump in September and October. 
</P>
<P>
"I believe what is happening at Underground Atlanta is normal -- especially 
when many of the food operators there have little experience," said retail 
analyst Neil Thall. 
</P>
<P>
"I see nothing indicative of a general problem with Underground. It takes a 
while for retailers at a large center like this to shake down," said Thall, 
director of retail services with Kurt Salmon Associates. "Underground looks 
pretty healthy to me." 
</P>
<P>
That's how it looks to Ken Piotrowski, owner of the Christmas Factory, and 
Dante Stephensen, owner of Dante's Down The Hatch -- both veteran Georgia 
businessmen whose shops are doing considerably better than they had expected. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm doing 2 1/2 times the business I expected," said Stephensen, whose 
nightclub-restaurant was one of the most popular in the original Underground 
Atlanta, a complex that closed in the mid-1970s after a decline blamed on petty 
crimes and transit system construction. 
</P>
<P>
Stephensen said he based his projections on graphs he kept during the 11 years 
he operated in old Underground. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything boomed in June, July and August. But we knew it wouldn't continue," 
he said. "But the figures have eased back above projections for everyone, 
assuming people made good projections." 
</P>
<P>
Piotrowski has been surprised by the amount of money people are willing to 
spend in Underground and at his shop, which features imported Christmas tree 
ornaments and decorations. 
</P>
<P>
"There are some very, very wealthy people walking around. We've had people walk 
into the store and spend $2,000, no problem," he said, adding that many of his 
customers are international tourists and conventioneers.

Jennifer Rainey's assessment of summer vacation used to be that it was three 
long, boring months. 
</P>
<P>
That was before she transferred to Fairmount Elementary School, where students 
attend class year-round and summer break is replaced by four minivacations that 
fall just when a sixth-grader needs them. 
</P>
<P>
"It gives you something to look forward to," said Jennifer, 11. "You think: 
'Hey, a couple more weeks of this and then I get three off.' I like it this way 
because it seems like you get more time off." 
</P>
<P>
Jennifer's is the nation's longest-running year-round school. Francis Howell 
School District, just west of St. Louis, pioneered the concept in 1969 in an 
effort to solve overcrowding; but, today, education reformers think the idea 
may be just what the country needs to improve its educational system. 
</P>
<P>
"We're asking schools to do more and more, but we're keeping the clock and the 
calendar the same. You can't fit 10 gallons into a 5-gallon can," said Ernest 
L. Boyer, former U.S. commissioner of education and now the head of the 
Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching in Princeton, N. J. 
</P>
<P>
Students spend the same number of days in class, but, instead of a summer 
vacation, they get shorter breaks throughout the year. More and more schools 
are scrapping traditional schedules in favor of the more efficient year-round 
ones, and no one seems to be complaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm convinced that a longer school year is inevitable because of the need to . 
. . meet the changing work and family patterns of the nation," Boyer said. 
</P>
<P>
This year, an estimated 475,000 students in 19 states -- less than 1% of the 
nation's students -- attend year-round schools, said Charles Ballinger, 
executive director of the National Assn. for Year-Round Schooling. 
</P>
<P>
But that's twice as many as five years ago, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Ohio has the longest school year, with 182 days, and Minnesota has the shortest 
with 170, according to the Education Commission of the States. 
</P>
<P>
Missouri's state Board of Education plans to ask the Legislature to increase 
its 174-day year -- the nation's second-shortest -- to 200 days by the year 
2000. Thirty-four states use 180-day school years. 
</P>
<P>
Even if the school year is not lengthened, many educators say, a year-round 
schedule makes sense. Some say it improves learning. Others say it helps ease 
overcrowding and puts school buildings to work full time. 
</P>
<P>
"The traditional, agricultural calendar has no value to us any longer," said 
Norman Brekke, superintendent of the K-8 Oxnard School District in Ventura 
County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
"As a matter of fact, the nine-month calendar and the fact that schools are out 
for three months of the year is a costly extravagance, which I don't believe 
our society should accept." 
</P>
<P>
Brekke said that his district saved $16 million -- the cost of two new schools 
-- by converting to year-round classes in 1976, and test scores have improved. 
</P>
<P>
Supporters of year-round schooling include the Missouri branch of the National 
Education Assn., which recently issued a task force report recommending that 
all of the state's schools consider year-round programs. 
</P>
<P>
In California, state law requires districts to file a feasibility study on 
year-round schools or have a program to be eligible for some building funds. 
</P>
<P>
Utah also has provided incentives for consideration of year-round plans, and 
some inner-city districts must have year-round schooling by the 1990-91 year. 
</P>
<P>
However, some educators say that, although they like the idea, it is not always 
workable. 
</P>
<P>
In St. Louis, for example, Supt. Jerome Jones said that the buildings are not 
equipped for year-round instruction: Most are not air-conditioned, and the 
district already is strapped for money to pay for paint and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
"Personally, I think it's desirable," Jones said. "If it were possible, I would 
explore it." 
</P>
<P>
Even the Francis Howell district has found that it is not workable at the 
secondary level. An experiment with a junior high school failed because of the 
problems presented by extracurricular activities like sports. 
</P>
<P>
Another group that is not exactly thrilled is the summer camp industry. 
</P>
<P>
"People are very concerned about what could happen, but, at the moment, the 
impact hasn't been significant," said Shirley Walch, who heads the American 
Camping Assn.'s Southern California section. "Some of our camps can accommodate 
and adapt, and then there are some that could be devastated by it." 
</P>
<P>
Administrators at Fairmount in St. Peters say their system is supported by 
students, teachers and parents. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a system that's worked very effectively," Principal Larry Smith said. 
"The burdensome part is developing the schedule, staffing the building and the 
movement of students and teachers in school." 
</P>
<P>
Fairmount students are split into four cycles and attend class for nine weeks, 
then get three weeks off. The start of each cycle is staggered so that, at any 
given time, three cycles are in session and one is off. Classrooms are always 
filled. 
</P>
<P>
The system is not without some drawbacks, though. Teachers say the biggest 
headache is moving. 
</P>
<P>
"A classroom teacher rotates with her students, so, when you go off cycle on 
your three-week break, you move out of your classroom so another teacher and 
class can move in," teacher Chris Guinther said. "So, you end up having to pack 
up your teaching materials and supplies. Logistically, it's a problem." 
</P>
<P>
Ideally, when overcrowding is not a factor, a year-round school has only one 
cycle and teachers don't have to move. 
</P>
<P>
For working parents, the biggest concern is arranging for child care when their 
vacations do not coincide with their kids'. Some children use the time to visit 
grandparents or enroll in YMCA or other activities. 
</P>
<P>
When the schedules do coincide, Fairmount Assistant Principal Pat McCoy said, 
"Then it's an advantage because you can take your kids to Disneyland in 
September or October and you don't have to take them out of school, and you 
miss all the crowds."

FOR BEDOUIN OF ISRAEL, LIFE STYLE OF THE OPEN DESERT IS QUICKLY FADING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
RAHAT, Israel 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bearing a small white flag that signals the imminence of a wedding, a large 
communal tent stands out starkly amid the cluster of masonry houses that give 
drab architectural definition to Rahat. 
</P>
<P>
Once a common sight in the Negev Desert, the patchwork goat-hair dwellings of 
Israel's 120,000 Bedouin have all but disappeared, symbolizing the end of 6,000 
years of nomadic life. For Abu Yaihye, a town elder who, like all but a handful 
of the country's Bedouin, is now suddenly an urban dweller, it has not been a 
change for the better. 
</P>
<P>
"For centuries, the Bedouin have valued three things: a good horse, a nice wife 
and a large green land," says Abu Yaihye, gesturing from the tent toward a 
joyless row of newly constructed block houses that includes his own. "Now the 
Israeli authorities need us to live like this. From here, it is a place where 
you only go to the grave." 
</P>
<P>
Not all of Israel's Bedouin share Abu Yaihye's bleak view of their new urban 
life style. But few would disagree that in Israel, as across the Arab world, a 
rough and romantic way of life is vanishing almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
Lured by the comforts of 20th-Century living and prodded by the requirements of 
state-building in Israel, the vast majority of Israel's Bedouin have been 
prompted -- some would say forced -- to swap desert wanderings for urban 
settlements such as Rahat, 12 miles north of Beersheba. 
</P>
<P>
By the usual material standards, life is better for the Bedouin, who are now 
surrounded by amenities -- schools and health clinics, television sets and real 
beds -- not normally associated with tent living. 
</P>
<P>
But the end of nomadic life has taken something crucial out of Bedouin life. 
Time, once measured by the lazy arc of the sun, is now governed by clocks and 
appointments. Land, once shared according to tribal etiquette, has been 
confiscated. Status, once a function of age and wisdom, is now determined by 
money, jobs and connections. 
</P>
<P>
"The hills I looked out on as a child had the rounded shapes of tents and 
camels," says Ali al Asad, principal of a secondary school in the Bedouin 
village of Lagiya. "Now the soft contours have given way to the stark cubes of 
the block houses. It reflects a new mind-set. Now we're thinking in cubes; 
we're thinking in frames that are already made." 
</P>
<P>
Before the state of Israel was created in 1948, there was little to challenge 
the free-floating life style of the Bedouin, whose camels and herds of goats 
and sheep lived off the stingy offerings of the desert that makes up more than 
half of Israel's land area. 
</P>
<P>
After 1948, the Negev was forced to accommodate two peoples, as Israel's 
founding fathers built settlements and industries in the desert to attract 
waves of early immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest change came after Israel relinquished the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt 
in 1982, forcing the transfer of key military installations to the Negev. To 
make room, the government expropriated 25,000 acres of Bedouin grazing land -- 
one of several waves of land confiscation, according to the Beersheba-based 
Assn. for Support and Defense of Bedouin Rights in Israel. 
</P>
<P>
The transition to sedentary life, begun gradually half a century ago by the 
Bedouin themselves, has been accelerated dramatically by Israel's 
carrot-and-stick policy toward the once-nomadic tribesmen, 75,000 of whom live 
in the Negev. 
</P>
<P>
After Israel paved roads and built clinics and schools, many Bedouin were 
encouraged to settle in urban areas, the core of what Israeli planners hope 
will be seven major towns of 10,000 to 20,000 that will be home to nearly all 
Negev Bedouin. A similar policy is in effect in the Galilee, where most of the 
rest of Israel's Bedouin reside. 
</P>
<P>
But there have been other ways of dealing with those more reluctant to abandon 
old ways. "Green patrols," organized by Israel's agriculture ministry, have 
uprooted crops and seized thousands of goats and sheep grazing in 
"unauthorized" areas. Ostensibly organized to protect the environment, many 
Bedouin see the patrols as part of an effort by Israel to "Judaize" the desert. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, land confiscation has drawn a tighter and tighter circle around the 
Bedouin grazing lands. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel like the Indians in the United States: They take all our property and 
put us in reservations," says Nuri el Ukbi, chairman of a Bedouin rights group 
that is attempting to persuade Israel to relinquish plans for urban townships 
in favor of a series of farming and shepherding communities. 
</P>
<P>
Crowded into urban settlements, the transformation in Bedouin life -- for good 
and for ill -- has been drastic. Tribal loyalties have largely disappeared. 
Crime and drugs, virtually absent before, are gradually surfacing. In the more 
sedentary setting, birthrates have skyrocketed. The men, once fiercely 
independent, are now dependent on low-status, low-paying service jobs in towns 
such as Beersheba. 
</P>
<P>
At the same, the changes have begun to upgrade the decidedly second-class 
status of women, as compulsory education leads to careers and transforms 
courting practices. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, as nomadic customs and life style have been replaced, the Bedouin's 
sense of Arab identity has grown. Unlike Palestinian Arabs, Bedouin are 
considered loyal to the state and allowed to serve in the Israeli army. Yet 
more than 50% of all Bedouin voted for leftist parties demanding equal rights 
for Israel's Arab minority in last November's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
"No people has gone through such a major transition in such a short time," says 
Avner Goren, an archeologist and one of Israel's leading experts on Bedouin 
life. 
</P>
<P>
Opinion on whether Bedouin have been helped or hurt by the tide of change 
largely reflects the generational split such change has caused. The transition 
has been much harder on older Bedouin such as Abu Yaihye, for whom the loss of 
the prouder, more self-sufficient life of his ancestors has been openly 
painful. 
</P>
<P>
But for many younger Bedouin, the jury remains out. 
</P>
<P>
"What's a good life? Money? Education?," asks Ali al Asad. "Value judgments are 
hard to make. I can't say for sure whether, with a computer and a master's 
degree, I have a better way of life." 
</P>
<P>
"I'm ambivalent," concurs 20-year-old Mohammed, who is spending his last few 
weeks in a traditional Bedouin tent before moving to Lagiya. "There's much more 
comfort, not having to walk two kilometers for water. On the other hand, I'm no 
longer free. Being a Bedouin is the feeling of freedom."

RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POLICE GUARDS, FEDERAL INFORMANT INVESTIGATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>

BROOKSVILLE, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A mob informant and his Rhode Island police guards developed such a loose 
relationship over 3 1/2 years that they frolicked in Florida together and sold 
vehicles to each other, even though the protected witness was serving a prison 
term. 
</P>
<P>
And security was so lax that anybody looking for informant Peter Gilbert -- a 
prized witness who traveled to court surrounded by police sharpshooters -- had 
only to look in Rhode Island auto title applications to find the address of his 
supposedly secret hideaway. 
</P>
<P>
His widow, Debra, and her lawyer also alleged in recent interviews at her 
Florida home that police told her Gilbert to turn in phony receipts for 
Gilbert's expenses. 
</P>
<P>
A Rhode Island attorney general's report also said Gilbert, serving a 10-year 
prison term for murder at the time he was a protected witness, illegally had 
guns, improperly collected welfare and often was allowed to roam freely. He 
frequently was ferried to Florida with his guards, some of whom allegedly 
brought their girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
"It was just as if they were a bunch of fraternity guys, sky-diving, drinking, 
women," said Thomas Hogan Jr., Debra Gilbert's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
Her revelations are the latest about her husband's custody that have surfaced 
since he died June 11, 1988. They flabbergast the man who founded the federal 
witness-protection program. 
</P>
<P>
"Our prime goal is to keep him alive, to keep him in the right frame of mind to 
testify," said John Partington, a former U.S. marshal recently named 
Providence, R.I., public safety commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert, 43, died of a heart attack while on an unsupervised sky-diving trip to 
Connecticut. The attorney general's report later acknowledged that police knew 
that he had a history of heart problems. Police found cocaine in his car. 
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island state police are investigating, but previous reports by the 
attorney general and the Providence Journal-Bulletin showed that the state 
spent as much as $169,000 on Gilbert and his wife during his 3 1/2 years in 
police custody. Purchases included bullets, liquor, jewelry, concert tickets 
and 52 sky-diving trips. 
</P>
<P>
Two of Gilbert's guards have committed suicide since his death and two were 
reassigned from the police intelligence unit to the uniform division. Former 
Providence Police Chief Anthony J. Mancuso, who became the attorney general's 
chief drug enforcement officer while continuing to be paid by Providence after 
stepping down as chief, recently resigned from the attorney general's office 
and the force, citing continued publicity about the Gilbert case. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert was supposed to be a key witness against six reputed mobsters but 
testified against only one before his death. Because he died, charges against 
most of the others were dropped. 
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with the attorney general's office, Gilbert lived at the 
Providence police station from his arrest in February, 1985, until his transfer 
to a Glocester, R.I., safehouse in January, 1988. Debra Gilbert alternated 
between living in Florida and with her husband in Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the attorney general's office refused to release the safehouse 
address, but it was listed on a March, 1988, title application Gilbert filed at 
the Motor Vehicle Registry in connection with a car loan. 
</P>
<P>
"That is unbelievable," Partington said. "You don't have to be a police chief 
or security expert to say it's unthinkable" for Gilbert's address to be in 
public records. 
</P>
<P>
Gilbert paid Detective Jeffrey Ward $3,000 for a 13-year-old Harley Davidson 
motorcycle in April, 1988, according to sales tax documents provided by a 
source close to the investigation who demanded anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
"I know about a motorcycle," said Ward, who declined to answer other questions. 
</P>
<P>
Providence and state police and the attorney general's office will not comment 
on the case. Mancuso, who stepped down in 1988, denied knowledge of any 
transactions between Gilbert and his guards, but would say no more. 
</P>
<P>
Debra Gilbert will not talk about many things because of the pending state 
police investigation. But Hogan said that among her other allegations are that: 
</P>
<P>
* Gilbert sold a Chrysler Cordoba to police matron Eva Diaz in early 1986. No 
title could be found under either name and Diaz referred questions to Debra 
Gilbert. Diaz said she took over loan payments on Gilbert's 1984 Buick after 
his death. 
</P>
<P>
* Gilbert told his wife her sixth-anniversary ring in 1987 was bought from 
Ward, who denies it. 
</P>
<P>
* Police officers told her to get phony receipts to include with the ones 
submitted to the attorney general for Gilbert's expenses -- receipts the 
attorney general's report says often were not reviewed. Debra Gilbert says she 
never heeded the officers' advice and will not name them. 
</P>
<P>
She said her husband made at least a dozen state-paid trips to Florida for 
family visits and to clear up outstanding charges, including a prison break. 
Hogan said the guards often brought girlfriends. 
</P>
<P>
Hogan said the guards and women would stay in hotel rooms while Gilbert stayed 
with his wife at her home, more than a mile away. It could not be determined 
who paid for the rooms or if the guards watched Debra Gilbert's house. 
</P>
<P>
WPRI television in Providence recently broadcast home videos of Gilbert and his 
guards frolicking in Florida and at a vacation home in Narragansett, R.I. 
</P>
<P>
One tape showed an officer, with his arm around Gilbert, saying: "The criminal 
justice system has been very, very good to us, huh Peter?"

Gladys Burkhead and her sister, Viola Spratlen, got into a cab the other day 
and the cabbie began smoking. Poor cabbie. 
</P>
<P>
"The guy was smoking and I just had a fit," Gladys said. She and Viola are 
annoyed by second-hand smoke and they aren't shy about saying so. 
</P>
<P>
"He said it was his cab and I said we were paying the bill. I said, 'If that's 
the way you feel about it, we'll just get out right here.' And we did. I said, 
'Don't pay him, Viola,' but she did," said Gladys, 83. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're old, you can bawl people out," said Viola, 78, with a laugh. "When 
we order a cab we ask 'em not to smoke. I wouldn't have done that 20 years 
ago." 
</P>
<P>
Why not? "You just don't. You wouldn't have the nerve to do it." 
</P>
<P>
"I think the difference is, I've survived all these years, and since I did 
survive, I can say more what I want to," Gladys said. "I've just got a few more 
years left, why not do some of the things the way I want them done?" 
</P>
<P>
Gladys and Viola surely do things their own way. They own their own home, live 
frugally on savings and Social Security, collect and mend clothing for the poor 
and nurture a neighborhood association Gladys founded 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Gladys, the sprier of the two, keeps a tidy yard and garden, coordinates 
volunteers who plant flowers in the median of a 23-block-long boulevard, and 
can't imagine being bored. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I know what I would have done if you weren't here," she said. "I was 
going to start on the north side and trim down all the vines that have grown up 
in the lilacs and then go around and finish the other sides." 
</P>
<P>
"I would have thought of something to do, too," Viola said. "She does the 
outside work and I do the inside work. You can't have two people in the same 
house work on a garden. We've got more friends who complain that so and so went 
right out and mowed over the petunias." 
</P>
<P>
The sisters agree that good health is critical for older people, but being 
happy has more to do with a cheery outlook than a perfect checkup. 
</P>
<P>
"When you give up, it takes a long time to die," Gladys said. "Grandma Perkins 
inspired me. The last day she lived, she mowed her yard, picked it all up, 
pulled weeds and went to bed and died. She was 89." 
</P>
<P>
Viola has trouble walking, making it a struggle reaching their second-floor 
living quarters. "The only time my knees don't hurt is when I'm sitting still. 
But I've always said that if I can't walk I'm going to crawl." 
</P>
<P>
Thirty years ago, they bought their 2 1/2-story home near Drake University and 
until three years ago they ran a small day-care center on the first floor. 
Their major expenses are health insurance, food and taxes. They don't have a 
car and are happy to depend on buses and cabs. Viola takes a few day trips with 
a seniors group and both visit Viola's daughter, Lucille, in Arizona once a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Getting old, they say, has been a lark. 
</P>
<P>
"Land, yes, it's easier when you're older," they said, almost in unison. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're young," Gladys said, "you're not very smart. You've got to make 
decisions that last the rest of your life. 
</P>
<P>
"When you're older, that's all over with." 
</P>
<P>
"Now I don't have a worry in the world," Viola said. "I used to worry about 
Lucille. Now I let her do the worrying." 
</P>
<P>
The sisters, born to a farm family in the central Iowa town of Prole, also say 
there are improvements that have made life easier for older people, such as 
good cars, indoor plumbing, central heating and the like. But those are just 
the trimmings. They'd be happy being old no matter what the year.

PROGRAM LETS FARMERS DIRECT U.S. AID TO EACH OTHER

R.B. Reynolds decides how to spend millions of federal agriculture dollars each 
year. He implements federal policy and sometimes hires or fires a government 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, however, is neither federal bureaucrat nor politician, but a wheat 
and corn farmer here in wind-swept Hartley County. 
</P>
<P>
He was elected by his Texas Panhandle neighbors to be chairman of the 
three-member committee that runs Hartley County's office of the Agricultural 
Stabilization and Conservation Service. 
</P>
<P>
Every U.S. county with some agriculture has a three-farmer committee elected by 
fellow farmers to direct the local office of the ASCS, which runs all the 
multibillion-dollar federal agriculture payment programs. 
</P>
<P>
It's a job considered unique among government aid programs, with the very 
recipients of federal dollars deciding who gets how many. 
</P>
<P>
Potential problems and conflicts are obvious: Would welfare mothers determine 
their friends' monthly checks or students decide roommates' eligibility for 
loans? But agriculture officials believe the elected committee members are in 
the best position to assess fairly the losses suffered by their neighbors -- 
and to keep them honest. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to follow the rules that come down, but we try to represent the farmer 
and his needs and what would be best for him," Reynolds said. "If you don't 
represent the farmer, who's going to?" 
</P>
<P>
The question of who to protect, the farmer or the government, is at times a 
difficult one for conscientious committee members. One day after Reynolds sided 
with farmers in an interview, he told a reporter he preferred to say committee 
members have to represent both sides and "mediate to try to work something 
out." 
</P>
<P>
Most committee members interviewed for an Associated Press study of the 1988 
drought-relief effort said they voted for the good of their neighbors whenever 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say you're representing the farmer -- maybe that's not the way it's 
supposed to be," said Mike Bouris, chairman of the Riverside, Calif., county 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want your neighbor to be mad at you because he didn't qualify," said 
John Rigolizzo Jr., the Camden County, N.J., committee chairman. "Yes, you 
could say he's sticking up for his buddy and his neighbor, but when we're in 
this office, we're government employees." 
</P>
<P>
Committee members, who are paid small stipends for their meetings, take an oath 
of office pledging to uphold the laws of Congress. Agriculture Department 
officials say they expect the committees to protect taxpayers as well as be 
fair to farmers. 
</P>
<P>
"They represent both, but they have rules and regulations they have to obey," 
Dan Shaw, the ASCS deputy administrator in charge of state and county 
operations, said from Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
"They can't just say this is a deprived area so let's take all the money in the 
Treasury and throw it out here," Shaw said. "We feel peers are the people who 
can make the really good, accurate decisions that need to be made." 
</P>
<P>
Committees have great latitude in administering agriculture programs, from 
establishing normal harvests to deciding whether a crop was cultivated 
properly. They must sometimes analyze farmers' financial standings and sort 
through corporations, partnerships and trusts. They also have to interpret an 
array of laws and regulations. 
</P>
<P>
"Some guidelines leave a lot for us to interpret. The smart people can read 
that and find ways to get around it," said Don Gronewald, a hay farmer who is a 
member of the Kaufman County, Tex., committee. 
</P>
<P>
"All of the programs are good programs, and when they put them out they had 
good intentions. But you're going to find somebody abusing and using the 
program to their benefit, and that makes it harder for the honest Joe," 
Gronewald said. 
</P>
<P>
Agriculture experts say farming in America is so vast that the local committee 
system is the only fair way to administer the aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
"There are these glitches. Two counties end up rendering two different 
decisions," said Bob Bergland, agriculture secretary under former President 
Jimmy Carter. "But you have to have room for local judgment. I'd say it works 
better than almost any other scheme you can think of." 
</P>
<P>
In the case of the drought program, many committees had to set crop yields and 
estimate how much would have been harvested in a normal year, as well as decide 
if a farmer kept his crop properly fertilized, weeded and, if possible, 
watered. 
</P>
<P>
And the committees of three had to decide whether each applicant farmer was 
eligible. 
</P>
<P>
In some cases, a county committee was more gracious with its constituents than 
either insurance companies evaluating the same losses or committees in 
neighboring counties interpreting the same regulations, the AP found. 
</P>
<P>
A crop insurance company balked at paying one Oklahoma farmer an irrigated 
yield of 69 bushels per acre on his damaged milo because he had watered just 
once. Insurance paid only the dry-land yield of 28 bushels. But the county 
committee granted drought relief based on the irrigated 69-bushel yield. The 
farmer received $4,467. 
</P>
<P>
"The committee made a determination that it was watered," said David F. Barnes 
Jr., director of the Texas County, Okla., ASCS office. 
</P>
<P>
The Chaves County, N. M., committee decided to pay a farmer $18,285 for cotton 
damage caused by "cold, rainy weather" and "high winds," although the bill 
contained provision for neither freeze-like damage nor wind damage. 
</P>
<P>
The drought-relief program was particularly troublesome for some committees 
because it was set up with such haste, officials said. Some farmers harvested 
their crops before applying for aid, making losses difficult to verify. 
</P>
<P>
In Gaines County, Tex., ASCS director John Wayne Hall said he struggled with 
1988 claims for lost winter wheat -- a crop planted in 1987 and cut months 
before Congress even considered the drought legislation. 
</P>
<P>
"How can I know what kind of product that boy had out there? It was long gone," 
Hall said. "In '88, we made a lot of judgments." 
</P>
<P>
A recent General Accounting Office report noted that the 1988 relief program 
was hard to administer because it required county officials to determine, on 
short notice, payments on close to 500 crops, from almonds to zucchini.

ARMY TAKES AIM AT REPLACING M-16 RIFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT MINOR, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
FT. BENNING, Ga. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Army is searching for an automatic rifle to replace the M-16, which 
soldiers have used since the Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
The goal is to develop a weapon that will make the 21st-Century soldier twice 
as effective at wounding or killing enemy troops, overcoming battlefield stress 
and unpredictable targets. 
</P>
<P>
"The M-16A2 is the finest combat rifle in the world, but the accuracy of that 
weapon, because of human factors, is not as high as one would like it to be," 
said Pete Rowland, public affairs officer for the Army's Armament Research, 
Development and Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
Since September, 36 Army and Air Force shooters have been conducting 
preliminary tests with four advanced combat rifle prototypes at Ft. Benning. 
</P>
<P>
The Army has spent about $40 million since 1982 on research and development and 
expects to spend another $17 million by 1991, when officials decide what 
technology to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
The prototypes were submitted by Colt Industries of Hartford, Conn., 
Steyr-Daimler-Puch of Steyr, Austria, AAI Corp. of Hunt Valley, Md., and 
Heckler &amp; Koch, a German firm with a U.S. subsidiary in Chantilly, Va. 
</P>
<P>
The Colt rifle fires conventional ammunition or a duplex cartridge with two 
projectiles. Colt claims one projectile travels to the point of aim and the 
other diverges slightly to increase hit probability. 
</P>
<P>
The Steyr uses a plastic-cased cartridge that fires a steel flechette, or dart. 
The AAI rifle fires a brass cartridge with a flechette and the Heckler &amp; 
Koch a bullet from a "caseless cartridge" made of molded propellant. 
</P>
<P>
Rowland said that the Army is trying to develop a rifle that fires lightweight, 
low-cost ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
"The soldier of today . . . is weightily equipped," he said. "Anything that can 
be done to make that lighter -- and a lot is being done -- will increase his 
effectiveness. Probably from head to foot, the Army is looking for a way to 
lighten the load." 
</P>
<P>
The M-16 already is lighter than the Soviet-designed AK-47, but that assault 
rifle has the reputation of being more durable on the dirty battlefield than 
the M-16. The M-16 typically takes smaller ammunition than the AK and most 
other assault rifles. 
</P>
<P>
In battle, the soldier's shooting skills are hampered by a variety of factors, 
such as stress, fatigue, weather conditions and obscured targets, Rowland said. 
</P>
<P>
"The goal is to develop some compensations in the weapon to offset the outside 
factors that affect a soldier in battle," he added. "The soldier . . . has to 
have twice the accuracy that he has with the current version." 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, the Army conducted extensive engineering and safety tests on 
the prototypes at Aberdeen Proving Ground, Md. 
</P>
<P>
The Army scheduled a media briefing and demonstration of the weapons this month 
at Ft. Benning. Next month, another team of Army and Air Force shooters will 
arrive at Ft. Benning to start another three months of testing. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Harris, a media relations specialist at Picatinny Arsenal, said there is 
no timetable for phasing out the M-16. 
</P>
<P>
"Since the M-16 is over 20 years old now, the Defense Department has decided to 
look at new technology," he said. "The average life of a military rifle is 20 
to 30 years, going back to the flintlocks used in the Revolutionary War. If we 
find a technology that meets the needs of doubling the effectiveness of the 
M-16, then . . . we could have a new weapon in the hands of troops as early as 
1995." 
</P>
<P>
The M-16 was first issued to U.S. troops in 1967. During the Vietnam War it was 
criticized for jamming. The problem was corrected by using a different type of 
gunpowder in the rifle's 5.56-mm ammunition. The latest version, known as the 
M-16A2, was introduced in 1987. It has a maximum effective range of 550 meters 
and is more accurate and reliable than the earlier versions, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
"The M-16 is a very reliable weapon," he added. "It's considered one of the 
best combat rifles in the world."

OLDEST TEXAS COWBOY, 91, DIES WITH BOOTS ON, WIDE SKY ABOVE

<P>
A man believed to have been the oldest working cowboy in Texas died the way he 
wanted, stretched out in the prairie grass with his boots on, friends said. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas Everett Blasingame, 91, was found lying on his back Wednesday by fellow 
cowhands at the JA Cattle Co. ranch near Clarendon in the Texas Panhandle. His 
saddled horse was standing nearby. 
</P>
<P>
"If he had written it down on paper, he wouldn't have changed a word," said 
Buster McLaury, cattle foreman on the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
About 400 people attended graveside services Saturday at the JA Cattle Co. 
cemetery. The last burial in the cemetery had been in 1899. 
</P>
<P>
Johnny Farrar, the ranch's business manager, said Blasingame had been riding a 
young horse he was training just before his death. 
</P>
<P>
"He must have known he was in trouble, dismounted and just laid down and died," 
Farrar said. "There were no bruises or scratches, so he wasn't bucked off." 
</P>
<P>
"He was a good, kind man to everyone," said Blasingame's wife, Eleanor. "When 
he died, it was the first time I've ever seen a bunch of cowboys just crying. 
They were all devastated by his death." 
</P>
<P>
Blasingame's son, Thomas E. Blasingame Jr. of Hereford, said the cowboy was 
laid to rest during a traditional "cowboy funeral," with the hearse accompanied 
to the graveyard by Blasingame's riderless horse and cowboys on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
"There were lots of people there," the younger Blasingame said. 
</P>
<P>
Blasingame was born in Waxahachie on Feb. 2, 1898, and was a cowboy all of his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
He came to the JA Cattle Co. in 1918, then left two years later to go to 
Southern California, New Mexico and Arizona. He returned in 1934 and remained 
at the ranch until his death. 
</P>
<P>
He "had chosen to be a cowboy when he was a little kid," his son said. "The 
reason he lived so long was because he did what he did for his entire life." 
</P>
<P>
Farrar said Blasingame's job was to look after the cattle and horses, the 
ranch's fence and windmill. He said Blasingame displayed outstanding qualities 
for a cowboy of any age. 
</P>
<P>
"It was exceptional for him at age 91, because he performed the job just as all 
other cowboys do," Farrar said. 
</P>
<P>
Blasingame married when he was 35. He lived during the week at the Campbell 
Creek Camp in Palo Duro Canyon, 9 miles south of the ranch headquarters. The 
camp had no electricity or telephone, and his wife lived in nearby Claude.

Opponents of plans to put a $40-million low-level radioactive waste dump near 
Butte, Neb., intend to continue their fight "technically, politically and 
legally," according to Lowell Fisher, the leader of a group called Save Boyd 
County. But Ken Reiser, one of the leaders of the proponent People for 
Progress, said he was elated at the jobs the facility could bring to the area. 
At the office of US Ecology, the project developer, manager Bob Wittry handed 
out job applications even though the company won't even submit its license 
application to the state until July.

THE WAGNER DOCTORS KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO OPERATE A FAMILY PRACTICE 
</P>

SHINER, Tex. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
There's Dr. Bob and Dr. Dennis, as they are known around town. And don't forget 
their brother, Dr. Pat, who just retired. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are those soon-to-be doctors, Ralph, Timothy, Thomas and Ted, Dennis 
Wagner's grown sons. And Pat's youngest son, Jason, a premed student. 
</P>
<P>
"It's kind of contagious," says Dr. Bob Wagner about what is, in every sense, a 
family practice. 
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1970s, Bob Wagner and his younger brothers, Dennis and Pat, 
have been the only physicians in this town, best known for its beer brewery. 
</P>
<P>
Practicing medicine in a small town is not easy. But the Wagner clan loves it. 
</P>
<P>
"People say, thank you," Bob Wagner says. "You get a lot of gifts. You get a 
lot of food. You get turkeys and chickens and pies and cakes. 
</P>
<P>
"To me, somebody that's going to go out of their way to pay for a service and 
then ante up something. . . . That's very gratifying." 
</P>
<P>
The 2,000 townspeople in Shiner have depended on the Wagners for everything 
from surgery to treating the flu to delivering babies. 
</P>
<P>
The Wagners have delivered an estimated 4,500 to 5,000 babies, Bob says. 
</P>
<P>
Pat, 54, retired last year for health reasons. Now Bob, 63, and Dennis, 59, 
keep the medical practice going, attending to 40 patients a day and taking 
turns treating the sick and doing emergency room shifts at a nearby community 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Most patients visit the Wagners' clinic for appointments but the doctors still 
do what most physicians gave up years ago. They make house calls. 
</P>
<P>
"We stay very, very busy," Bob says. 
</P>
<P>
Their bustling office in downtown Shiner is housed in an old school building. 
</P>
<P>
In the waiting room is a portrait of the man who started it all: Frank Wagner, 
the father of Bob, Pat and Dennis. He was -- not surprisingly -- a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
Pat recalls local residents contacted his father at all times of the day and 
night for medical care, and his father always responded. 
</P>
<P>
"He went to Mass and Communion every day. When he lost a patient he would 
almost lose his mind," Pat recalls. "I guess we just had a real good man to 
identify with." 
</P>
<P>
Even though he was deeply devoted to Roman Catholicism, Frank Wagner was known 
to respect the beliefs of others. 
</P>
<P>
"He would always prescribe wine for the Baptists and Methodists," Bob says, 
with a smile. "They went right along with it -- for medicinal purposes." 
</P>
<P>
Frank Wagner was so special in town that the local hospital was named for him. 
</P>
<P>
His sons lament that the hospital was forced to close last year after 
struggling to survive. Its beds didn't remain full, and it fell prey to today's 
Medicare reimbursement system that pays a set amount for a diagnosis, no matter 
the cost of the service. 
</P>
<P>
Now Bob and Dennis travel to Yoakum Community Hospital about 10 miles from 
Shiner to care for patients. 
</P>
<P>
The brothers are trying to recruit a new doctor for their practice. Then Bob 
will consider retiring, he says. But trying to get a young physician to come to 
a small town isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
"The ones who like to hunt and fish and drive a tractor on their days off will 
come on down," Bob says. 
</P>
<P>
But the three Wagners returned to their hometown, even after studying medicine 
at prestigious Texas medical schools. More Wagners are starting to follow in 
their footsteps. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis says he never encouraged his four sons to go to medical school. In fact, 
he says: "I tried to discourage them from going into medicine, but to no 
avail." 
</P>
<P>
Now Ralph is completing his residency in Waco, and Timothy, Ted and Thomas are 
in medical school in Houston. Pat's son, Jason, is studying premed at Notre 
Dame. 
</P>
<P>
The Wagner family's interest in health care doesn't end there. Pat's wife is a 
dietitian, a daughter is a nurse and another daughter is a respiratory 
therapist. 
</P>
<P>
A sister of the Wagner brothers has eight children, and two of them are 
doctors.

<TEXT>
<P>
Denis Maillet is knee-deep in ducks, and he doesn't know what to do about them. 
</P>
<P>
Between 300 and 400 wild ducks have found the living so easy at Sabattus Lake 
behind Foster's General Store that they have stopped migrating south this 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
People from surrounding communities bring their children to the lake to feed 
the ducks, and a small waterfall behind the store keeps part of the lake open 
all winter, giving the ducks a place to swim. 
</P>
<P>
That makes everyone happy except Maillet, who owns a small warehouse next door. 
</P>
<P>
"I come in sometimes and find my yard full of ducks, in the driveway, 
everywhere," Maillet said. "The ground is covered with duck (droppings)." 
</P>
<P>
Maillet said he is in a no-win situation when it comes to dealing with the 
ducks. The birds damage his property and make it hard to get in and out of his 
building, and some local people get angry at him because they feel he is an 
animal-hater. 
</P>
<P>
"When I see people on my property feeding the ducks, I approach them and try to 
explain some of the problems that result from what they are doing," he said. 
"Some receive it gracefully, but others snub me off. You get the feeling they 
think you are a bad guy." 
</P>
<P>
Maillet said federal law prevents him from hurting the birds. "I'd be breaking 
the law if I ever even touched one of those ducks," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the size of the flock gets bigger and bigger. Linda Foster, who owns 
the general store next door, said the flock of ducks started out with just a 
few several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"I would say they have been here a good three years," she said. "There are a 
lot more of them now. I'm not sure when the people started feeding them, but 
they stay right here now through the winter." 
</P>
<P>
Maillet said the ducks are wild and should be left alone. He said some of the 
birds have lost parts of their feet and legs when they have become stuck in the 
ice on the lake. 
</P>
<P>
"Heck, I even recognize some of them now, especially some of them that have 
only one leg," he said.

ST. LOUIS ACTIVISTS STRUGGLE TO END VIOLENCE'S TOLL ON YOUNG BLACK MEN

<TEXT>
<P>
Baqi Cherry has felt the cold, hard barrel of a gun at his head and has seen 
bloody, violent death up close. 
</P>
<P>
"The easiest way out is to sell drugs in my community. I did it to survive. I 
sold drugs to feed myself," said Cherry, 19, who has survived life on the 
streets of America's deadliest city for young black men. "It wasn't until I got 
in the group that I found out there are other ways to get by." 
</P>
<P>
"The stuff that he's been through -- this kid could have given up a long time 
ago. He would have been a homicide statistic, no doubt in my mind," said Police 
Capt. Charles Alphin, who leads "the group" Cherry joined. 
</P>
<P>
Alphin formed the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. St. Louis Youth Support Group two 
years ago to help black teen-agers find alternatives to violence that are not 
preachy or sissy, that they can use and "still be cool." 
</P>
<P>
The 35 to 40 teen-agers meet each week in a classroom in Alphin's station house 
to talk about ways that nonviolence can work in their everyday lives, which are 
spent in neighborhoods where death, drugs, guns and gangs are not uncommon. 
</P>
<P>
Young black men in St. Louis are being killed at a higher rate than in any 
other large city, statistics show. A recent study by the Missouri Department of 
Health concluded that without change, one out of every 13 black males in St. 
Louis who are now 15 will be killed before age 45. 
</P>
<P>
Cherry can count friends and relatives among those statistics. He has come 
close, but with the help of "the group," he is a believer in nonviolence. 
</P>
<P>
Today Cherry, who graduated from high school in May, is working evenings at a 
bank. He is engaged to be married and plans to start college part-time in 
January. He wants to be an engineer, or maybe a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
Alphin's is one of many efforts aimed at reducing the deadly toll. In 1985-87, 
the murder rate for black men aged 15 to 44 was 258.8 per 100,000 people -- 
21.2% higher than Detroit and more than 130% higher than Washington. 
</P>
<P>
While the high rate was alarming to many, the composite of the typical victim 
was not surprising to anyone who reads the daily paper, where killings on the 
predominantly black North Side often are noted in a few quick paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
The typical victim: a man between 20 and 34, shot to death during an argument 
at night within a mile of his north St. Louis home. The killer: a black male 
acquaintance, 20 to 29 years old. 
</P>
<P>
Unemployment, drugs, inadequate housing and lack of education are cited by 
those who try to find the reason for St. Louis' epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
But Detroit, Washington and other major cities experience the same social ills. 
What makes St. Louis different? 
</P>
<P>
Part of the answer may be found in another study. 
</P>
<P>
University of Chicago researchers this year reported that St. Louis was one of 
10 "hypersegregated" cities, with multiple forms of segregation affecting only 
blacks. The others are Chicago; Baltimore; Cleveland; Detroit; Gary, Ind.; Los 
Angeles; Milwaukee; Newark, N.J., and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The result for blacks is isolation from amenities, opportunities and resources, 
making it more difficult for them to get ahead in life. 
</P>
<P>
"It may be that we have a disproportionate amount of people who feel that they 
are particularly locked out of the system," said Alphin, who is black. To 
dissolve that polarization, local government, business, religious and activist 
leaders need to coordinate an attack on those barriers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it has to be a regional approach. Black people can't solve this 
problem by themselves. They didn't create it. They certainly can't solve it by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
Some officials are quick to point out, however, that statistics can mislead, 
and that St. Louis would have fared better in the health department's study had 
the researchers looked at the decade as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
"You take New Orleans or Washington, D.C.," said Bill Kuehling, a spokesman for 
Mayor Vincent Schoemehl. "We may surpass them some years and they may surpass 
us some years. But you look at the major urban areas, they're all going to 
bounce around within the same ranges." 
</P>
<P>
Homicide totals in the last decade have ranged from a high of 265 in 1979 to a 
low of 128 in 1984, said William Peth of the St. Louis Police Department. In 
1985-87, the totals were 169, 195 and 153. Last year, there were 140. 
</P>
<P>
In Detroit, there were 636 homicides in 1985, 648 in 1986, and 686 in 1987. 
Washington tallied 148 homicides in 1985, 197 in 1986 and 228 in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, in the aftermath of the survey, the health department formed a 
study group to plan a community-wide conference on black homicide. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel that a major emphasis needs to be made in terms of education, 
employment and housing. Those three things are critical to general peace of 
mind," said Paul Saunders, the department's district administrator. And beyond 
that, he said, the group intends to keep the issue from fading. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to continue to pick the conscience of America, white and black. It's 
not a black problem, it's not a white problem. It's an American problem."

ESTHER MCCOY, 85, RENOWNED WRITER ON ARCHITECTURE, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Esther McCoy, considered the dean of local architecture writers for a 
collection of books and articles that chronicled the rise of design and 
designers in California, died Saturday at her Santa Monica home after a long 
illness. She was 85. 
</P>
<P>
The author of "Five California Architects," which since its publication in 1960 
has become a classic of the genre, McCoy described the people of vision who 
came to California and took advantage of the freedom and lack of tradition to 
create ingenious living spaces. 
</P>
<P>
"By the force of her writing and personality," said her publisher, David 
Travers, "Esther McCoy brought Southern California architecture to the 
attention of the world." 
</P>
<P>
"There's this 'plunger' attitude here that gives architects their freedom," she 
said in a 1985 interview in The Times. "No one's watching, really, so you can 
write better. You can design better. You can try out something and no one will 
really know that you're trying it out." 
</P>
<P>
Born Nov. 18, 1904, in Coffeyville, Kan., McCoy moved to California in the 
1930s and eventually went to work for Southern California architect R. M. 
Schindler. 
</P>
<P>
Among her duties in Schindler's studio was answering requests for information 
about his buildings, and out of that grew her career as an architecture writer. 
Eventually, she completed six books and numerous newspaper and magazine 
articles, including one scheduled for publication in January, Travers said. 
</P>
<P>
Through her efforts, the architects and architecture she wrote about became 
world-renowned. 
</P>
<P>
"These men were not well-known, but now they're by-words," Travers said. She 
wrote about Schindler, Irving Gill, Bernard Maybeck and other ground-breaking 
designers. Because of her work, a London-based association of architects began 
scheduling trips to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Her honors included the American Institute of Architects' Award for Excellence 
in 1985, the Star of the Order of Solidarity from the Republic of Italy and the 
Los Angeles County Museum of Art award for Distinguished Achievement in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
She is survived by a stepson, Forrest Tobie of Crescent City. 
</P>
<P>
A memorial service is scheduled for Friday at 2:30 p.m., at the Pierce Brothers 
Westwood Village Mortuary Chapel in Los Angeles.

FATHER BEDE REYNOLDS DIES; OILMAN BECAME PRIEST, TEACHER AND AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From A Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Father Bede Reynolds, a pioneering Southern California oilman who gave up his 
wealth to join the priesthood and teach, has died in Canada after a long 
illness. He was 97. 
</P>
<P>
Father Reynolds, formerly Kenyon L. Reynolds of Pasadena, built one of the 
first gasoline cracking plants in California in the early 1900s as general 
manager of Los Angeles-based Pacific Gasoline Co., which later was bought by 
Standard Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
He retired early and comfortably, but returned to the oil business to serve as 
the U.S. government's West Coast petroleum coordinator during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
After his wife, Patricia, died in 1945, he donated much of his wealth to the 
Roman Catholic Church and entered the Benedictine order of the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
After his ordination in 1951, Father Reynolds taught theology and English at 
Westminster Abbey, east of Vancouver. He also wrote several books, including 
his autobiography, "Rebel from Riches." 
</P>
<P>
Reynolds, who died Dec. 19 at the abbey, was the youngest of seven children. He 
had no children of is own and no immediate family members survive him. 
</P>
<P>
Services were held at the abbey.

GUNS IN THE BOOK BAG: PUPILS FIND NO SAFE HAVEN -- IN OR OUT OF CLASS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Alexander (Junior) Stevens traveled seven miles across the Bronx every morning 
to Alfred E. Smith High, an all-male vocational school known as a quiet place, 
a "safe" school. 
</P>
<P>
Junior was shot to death outside the school cafeteria on Nov. 14; a 15-year-old 
classmate was charged. The boys were playing with a .22-caliber pistol and 
fired it accidentally, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"There are plenty of safe schools all over the city where kids are sitting 
there with guns in their book bags. They just haven't decided to shoot yet," 
said Ed Muir, of the United Federation of Teachers, the teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
Junior's was the first killing in a city school since 1978, but in a system 
where violence is common, it seemed to have little effect on the other 
students. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing that everyone was taken aback by is that the kids seem to be taking 
this so calmly. It's just another kid whacked," said Muir. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Irushalmi, director of the Board of Education Office of School Safety, 
said students "bring guns to school because they don't feel safe going to and 
from school. . . . They say they need them to create a balance of power." 
</P>
<P>
Muir is more cynical. "Some kids feel they actually need it for protection, and 
some are businessmen who have large quantities of cash and thought it the 
prudent thing not to apply for a pistol permit." 
</P>
<P>
From September, 1988, to June, 1989, 1,854 weapons were seized at schools, from 
razor-edged box cutters to semiautomatic firearms. At 15 schools where teams of 
security guards used metal detectors, five guns and 815 other weapons were 
confiscated during the 1988-1989 school year -- a year that saw 1,356 students 
assaulted, 183 robbed and 78 sexually assaulted. Figures for the current year 
were unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
To balance the arms race, New York City spent $62 million on security in 1988, 
about 1% of its $7-billion budget. Metal detectors cost about $4 million of 
that; the rest supported 2,450 uniformed, but unarmed, security guards to 
police just under a million students. 
</P>
<P>
"If we were a police force, we would be the 10th largest police force in the 
country," Irushalmi said. 
</P>
<P>
To Muir, that isn't enough. He cites the increasingly frequent gun incidents -- 
twice a week last year, 19 in the first 34 school days of this year -- as 
evidence that the city's schools are dangerous places. Figures kept by his 
union show a 5% increase in crime inside schools during the 1988-89 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures for 1989 showed an 11% increase in school crime in 
September, and Muir said 44 teachers were assaulted during the first month of 
school last fall, compared to 27 during September, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
But Irushalmi, whose two children attend public schools, says the problem is 
not inside the buildings. Reports of violence inside schools have fallen from 
15,000 a year in 1981 to 9,000 in 1988-89. Outside, it is another story. 
</P>
<P>
"For anyone under 18 this is Dodge City and you have to carry a piece," he 
said. "Unfortunately, we don't have Miss Kitty at the Long Branch to make sure 
you check your piece at the door." 
</P>
<P>
In one corner of this Dodge City, outside Prospect Heights High School in 
Brooklyn, a student was shot on the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
"There's no safety in Prospect Heights," even though there are spot checks with 
metal detectors, said Bob (Brother) Abu, 15. "If (guards) don't come on Monday, 
they put the weapons in their lockers. So when the weapon detectors come on 
Wednesday, they have their weapons in the school already." 
</P>
<P>
"There ain't no safety," said his 17-year-old friend, who identified himself as 
Carl or Shrapnel Insepticon, a senior at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. 
He wore a blue bandanna over his lower face and said he was a member of the 
Decepticons, a street gang named after evil characters in "The Transformers," 
cartoon show. 
</P>
<P>
The loosely knit gang, which wears bandannas as identification, has been 
accused of taking part in Halloween rampages on Manhattan's East Side, and in 
wolfpack-type attacks on students at bus and subway stations. 
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 students stayed away from school on Halloween, apparently out 
of fear. More than 250 high school-age youths were arrested as they roamed the 
streets robbing, intimidating and assaulting pedestrians and merchants. 
</P>
<P>
Muir and the UFT have proposed some remedies: metal detectors in every school, 
police liaisons for junior high schools, stiffer penalties for carrying guns. 
But these steps, all agree, will not solve the underlying problems that lead to 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
"The schools are a mirror of society," Irushalmi said, citing the easy 
availability of weapons and "the diminution of values." 
</P>
<P>
"These kids don't distinguish between the schools and the streets," Muir said. 
"They don't see any difference." 
</P>
<P>
"We really think it's related to drugs. Part of it has to do with the sales, 
but another part is a lot of the kids' parents are using drugs, and the kids 
are acting out," said Gretchen Rausch, an assistant commissioner of the 
Probation Department who began her career as a probation officer in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
Arrests of pupils ages 7 to 16 rose 27% from 1987 to 1988, she said. 
</P>
<P>
The youngsters say there is no simple reason why they prey upon each other and 
their teachers. 
</P>
<P>
Sean Chittick, 17, is a senior at Murry Bergtraum High School, across from 
police headquarters and regarded by many as one of the safest schools. Still, 
he sees violence all around him, and he is mystified. 
</P>
<P>
"It just be happening for no type of reason," he said. "Now they just be 
killing them for gold jewelry, or 'You lookin' at my girl.' "

RESEARCHERS BRAVE COLD IN STUDY OF WARMING

A scientist braved numbing subzero temperatures this summer to uncover more 
than 800 years of Earth's climate trends that may reveal whether the planet is 
warming up because of modern man's excesses. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Kendrick Taylor of Reno's Desert Research Institute endured temperatures 
that plunged to 40 below zero Fahrenheit and occasionally warmed to freezing as 
he joined a team of American researchers on the six-week Greenland Ice Sheet 
Project 2. 
</P>
<P>
"We have to understand what happened in the past to test our theories and ideas 
about what will happen to the climate in the future," Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
"This was the first year so we're still analyzing data and no great discoveries 
were made. But when the project is finished, this will definitely give us some 
help in answering the big question about the greenhouse effect." 
</P>
<P>
The Greenland project, funded by the National Science Foundation, is the most 
ambitious drilling effort ever undertaken by the United States and parallels 
studies by European nations and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Project scientists plan to drill 10,000 feet down into the Greenland icecap 
that has remained frozen from the Earth's past ice ages to review a panorama of 
environmental history spanning 200,000 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
During this summer's first season on the project, Taylor said 24 scientists and 
workers drilled a hole 5.2 inches wide and more than 650 feet deep to unearth 
about 800 years of environmental history. 
</P>
<P>
"We were definitely working in harsh conditions; it got up to freezing one 
day," Taylor said. "But overall it was a good experience. And, believe it or 
not, the food was great. Some people gained weight." 
</P>
<P>
Scientists generally worked 10- to 14-hour days, he said, and did not have much 
time for recreation, although some hardy athletes set up a volleyball net for a 
few games. 
</P>
<P>
"We were pretty comfortable most of the time," he said. "We slept in heated 
tents that were about 10 degrees, and we have a few heated buildings for 
showers and an outhouse. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't decided yet, but I think I'm going back next year. The project will 
last four three to four years." 
</P>
<P>
The scientists are exploring compacted ice at the base of the Greenland ice 
sheet that is composed of snow, dust and small amounts of chemicals from two 
ices ages ago. 
</P>
<P>
Traces of impurities in the ice layers provide a chronicle of changes in air, 
sea temperatures, precipitation, storm severity, biological evolution, man-made 
pollution and solar activity. 
</P>
<P>
Gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, which are thought to be contributing 
to the greenhouse increase in the Earth's average temperatures, can can be 
measured in the ice layers. 
</P>
<P>
NASA scientists have estimated that if humans do nothing to cut down on the 
current amounts of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere, temperatures in 
the year 2050 will be six to seven degrees higher than they are today, 
producing enormous climate changes. 
</P>
<P>
The level of the ocean could rise anywhere from one to six feet as polar 
icecaps melt and the frequency and severity of storms would increase, according 
to NASA scientist James Hansen. 
</P>
<P>
Causes of the greenhouse effect include the use of chlorofluorocarbons in 
refrigerants and aerosols, burning fossil fuels such as coal and gasoline and 
cutting down forests and plant life that renew the Earth's oxygen supplies. 
</P>
<P>
The National Science Foundation is coordinating the U.S. Greenland Ice Sheet 
Project with the European Science Foundation, which is funding extraction of an 
ice core 20 miles away from the American project. 
</P>
<P>
The two ice cores from the Greenland Ice Sheet will let scientists compare and 
validate their data, Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
The deepest ice core obtained by Soviet scientists at Vostok in the heart of 
East Antarctica was about 7,200 feet long and contained a record going back 
160,000 years or more. 
</P>
<P>
Taylor, a geophysicist with the Desert Research Institute's Water Resources 
Center, was the scientist in charge of electric conductivity tests on the 
Greenland Ice Sheet project this past summer. 
</P>
<P>
His research into the relative acidity in the ice has so far produced evidence 
of several volcanic eruptions near the summit of the Greenland Ice Sheet. 
</P>
<P>
"It's really amazing how much information you can obtain under studies like 
this," Taylor said. "You can pull gas samples out of the ice and tell what was 
in the air that day years ago."

HUMANS POSE LATEST THREAT TO FISH THAT HAS SURVIVED 380 MILLION YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK D. ROYLANCE, BALTIMORE EVENING SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The coelacanth, a rare fish that has survived deep in the Earth's seas almost 
unchanged for 380 million years, is being threatened by the toxins, greed, 
curiosity and superstition of one of the planet's newest residents -- humans. 
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in Gloucester, 
Va., has found high levels of DDT and PCBs in the tissues of frozen coelacanth 
(pronounced SEAL-a-kanth) specimens taken from deep water off the southeast 
coast of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
John A. Musick, who headed the study at the institute, said the fish are being 
also hunted by impoverished fishermen hoping to meet a growing demand from 
scientists and taxidermists and by Asians who believe that the fish's spinal 
fluid can prolong human life. 
</P>
<P>
By some estimates, at the current rate at which the coelacanths are being 
killed -- perhaps six to 12 a year -- they will be extinct in 30 years, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very scary situation," Musick said. "It's even more alarming because if 
we lose the coelacanths, we're not losing a species, or a genus or a family. 
We're losing a superorder -- the last member of a species that dominated the 
world's ecology for millions of years." 
</P>
<P>
Until 1938, when a specimen came up in a trawler's net near the Comoro Islands 
in the Indian Ocean, coelacanths were thought to have been extinct for 70 
million years. 
</P>
<P>
Scientists ever since have asked endless questions about these primitively 
built, five-foot-long fish, not the least of which is its place in the long 
chain of evolution leading from fish to "tetrapods" -- four-legged, 
air-breathing land animals and man. 
</P>
<P>
But the fish are scarce and, until recently, well-preserved specimens for study 
have been even more elusive. 
</P>
<P>
In November, 1987, the institute obtained two frozen coelacanths for detailed 
dissection and study, work that began with a marathon dissection session two 
months later and has continued with the soon-to-be published toxicological 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
Institute chemist Robert C. Hale said the levels of PCBs, a highly toxic 
industrial pollutant, and the pesticide DDT found in the two coelacanths -- 
approaching one part per million -- probably did not pose an immediate threat 
to the coelacanths or to the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
"But if it increased two or three times, it would be a major concern," he said. 
Recent research in California on other fish species suggests that "reproduction 
is very strongly affected by the body burden of PCBs and DDT. . . . When you 
start getting into the parts-per-million range, there is a definite effect on 
spawning success." 
</P>
<P>
And because they reproduce very slowly, he said, coelacanths would be 
"particularly at risk." 
</P>
<P>
The real surprise for Hale was that a fish from such a remote site and such 
deep water (they live 650 to 2,000 feet below the surface) had any PCBs at all. 
</P>
<P>
But Musick was not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of the global dynamics of the transport (of such substances), there 
ain't no place you can go. It's a sad truth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
The long-lasting PCBs get into the atmosphere and fall with the rain into the 
oceans, where they are taken up in the chitin shells of tiny zooplankton. 
</P>
<P>
"And virtually everything else munches on these things," Musick said. Then, 
because the chitin is indigestible, it falls in fecal pellets to the ocean 
bottom. There, the PCBs are taken up on the food web of bottom feeders, like 
the coelacanths. 
</P>
<P>
The presence in the coelacanths of DDT, rather than one of the byproducts of 
its slow decomposition, was more surprising to Musick. 
</P>
<P>
"The fact that the animals had DDT indicated the stuff is still being used over 
. . . in East Africa. And that should be some cause for alarm for people 
interested in the global environment," he said. DDT use has been banned in the 
United States since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
The "fossil fish" are under a more direct threat from native and foreign 
collectors. Fishermen can sell a coelacanth carcass to the government of the 
impoverished Comoros for the equivalent of one or two years' wages, Musick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
They bring several thousand dollars on the black market, which includes 
taxidermists and Asians seeking the fish's spinal fluid, which is regarded as a 
longevity potion. 
</P>
<P>
Such pressure could mean the end of coelacanths, which scientists believe grow 
slowly, take a long time to reach sexual maturity and have a small number of 
young. 
</P>
<P>
"Such animals tend to be very vulnerable to overfishing and slow in recovering 
because their reproductive potential is so low," Musick said.

recipients of government disability benefits can earn, the Department of Health 
and Human Services announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
HHS Secretary Louis W. Sullivan said the increases "will serve as an additional 
incentive for many disabled Americans to return to work and improve the quality 
of life for themselves and their families." 
</P>
<P>
The rules will affect recipients of Social Security Disability Insurance and 
Supplemental Security Income who are not blind.

ONE THING BILLY MARTIN DIDN'T MANAGE VERY WELL WAS HIS LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LITTWIN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Billy Martin does not, even now, rest in peace. There is tragedy there, and 
irony, too. 
</P>
<P>
If Martin ever sought solitude, he never found it. 
</P>
<P>
He died a violent death at the foot of his home in upstate New York, where he 
had moved a year ago. It was a country retreat, a 148-acre farm, far removed 
from the too-public violence of his life. This was where the circus would end 
and where he could start anew. 
</P>
<P>
But Martin died Monday on an icy road as a passenger in his own pickup truck, 
driven by a close friend who has been charged with driving while intoxicated. 
That the friend owned a bar in Detroit has been well noted. So, too, that 
Martin, a high-wire act to the end, was not wearing a seat belt. 
</P>
<P>
A New York county prosecutor has asked for an autopsy to determine the precise 
cause of death. In accordance with the wishes of Martin's wife, however, the 
coroner has refused, noting that Martin was, in this case, a victim -- a 
choice, and perhaps apt word. 
</P>
<P>
And so it goes for Martin, controversy following him to the grave. 
</P>
<P>
He was the dark side of sport. He was the driven man, who needed beyond all 
reason to succeed. And what drove him was rage. It was anger that made him pull 
a Reggie Jackson off the field or punch his own pitcher in the face. Anger and 
usually drink. He was angry at the world, and his anger, along with the drink, 
would prove his downfall. Amateur psychologists will line up to tell us of the 
father who deserted Martin as an infant and the scars it left on him. We know 
for sure only that there were scars, deep and ugly and too often made public. 
</P>
<P>
If he sought solace in drink, he never found it there, either. He was dangerous 
in a bar, to himself and to others. We can only guess he was an angry drunk. 
His long police blotter, which extended, of course, to Baltimore, tells us as 
much. 
</P>
<P>
By the end, he had become a caricature of himself. It was only a year ago when 
Martin, then age 60, described himself as Billy the Kid, with loaded 
six-shooters, we could surmise, at the ready. He wanted everyone to know that 
if the world wanted some of him, he was ready to take the world on. In the end, 
of course, the world won. It was ever thus. 
</P>
<P>
He insisted, too, after all his travails, that his drinking was not a problem, 
which recalled the old joke along the lines: I don't have a drinking problem; I 
drink, I pass out, no problem. 
</P>
<P>
We can recall that he was a brilliant manager, one of the few who could 
actually make a difference. He won in city after city, for team after team, 
only to be exiled when, finally, he would lose control of himself or of the 
players he drove too hard or of both. 
</P>
<P>
He will be most remembered, of course, as a Yankee, first as the over-achieving 
player and finally as the co-star, along with George Steinbrenner, of the 
tragicomedy in five acts that was Martin's managerial career in pinstripes. He 
was the damned Yankee. 
</P>
<P>
If we look closely, we can see that Steinbrenner is the villain of the piece. 
It was Steinbrenner who did the hiring and firing. It was Steinbrenner who kept 
holding the job in front of Martin as if it were a piece of meat and Martin a 
salivating dog. The low point may have been that commercial they cut with 
Steinbrenner firing Martin, who had become, by that time, a marionette. We know 
who pulled the strings, but we don't know exactly why. 
</P>
<P>
Certainly, Steinbrenner knew Martin might make a difference, if he could last 
long enough without imploding. Steinbrenner also knew of Martin's drinking 
problem and how it was exacerbated by the pressure of managing. By the fifth 
incarnation, which ended when the American League umpires basically led a 
revolt against Martin, it was too sad to watch. This had become an exercise in 
pulling the wings from a fly. 
</P>
<P>
Martin was not an easy person to feel sorry for. He had a nasty, biting temper 
and seemed to take pleasure in the misery of others. He was quick to lash out 
-- one's a born liar and the other's convicted. 
</P>
<P>
And yet, like him or not, he was a tragic figure, hurtling surely toward an 
unhappy end. When the news came of his death, who among us was surprised? 
Alcohol is thought to be a contributing factor, and who would have guessed 
otherwise? He was reportedly coming home from a bar the night he died. All his 
life, he had come to no good in bars. Remember the other beer commercial -- I 
didn't punch no dogie -- that was supposed to make us laugh? There's no more 
laughing now. And there's no one to rage against the dying of the light.

THE '80S LEFT A FAVORABLE IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL JACKMAN, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One guy described it as "sports' darkest decade." Another suggested the best 
thing about the concluding 10 years is that they're nearly over. What were the 
1980s and why are they saying such nasty things about them? 
</P>
<P>
To begin with, 1980 hadn't even warmed up when Americans, most recognizing 
hockey for the first time, rejoiced in the mammoth victory of the U.S. Olympic 
squad over the Soviets in Lake Placid, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
How big was that victory? It took on a combined historical-hysterical 
significance in that people everywhere recalled where they were and what they 
were doing at the instant they heard the news. That's the ultimate litmus test. 
</P>
<P>
One of the finest fights of the decade followed within a few months, when Sugar 
Ray Leonard defeated Roberto Duran in Montreal. And if you didn't go for that 
one, certainly the Leonard-Tommy Hearns brawl in Las Vegas the next year was 
numero uno. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, Muhammad Ali had dominated the fight game totally for 15 years. 
Sugar Ray moved front and center as Ali bowed out, so the torch was passed to a 
worthy successor. 
</P>
<P>
Over on the tennis courts, Bjorn Borg was wrapping up a brilliant career 
(particularly at Wimbledon) and handing over No. 1 to John McEnroe. As long as 
they belt the Slazengers at Wimby, who will ever forget Mac's 18-16 tie-breaker 
victory over Bjorn in the fourth set of a classic won in the fifth by Borg, 
8-6? 
</P>
<P>
As magnificently as the decade began with the "Miracle on Ice," the Olympics 
fell on tough times for a while with the countering boycotts of 1980 in Moscow 
and 1984 in Los Angeles. The 1984 Games, however, proved an immense show and 
defined the style and manner in which all subsequent Olympics will be staged. 
</P>
<P>
Bigger isn't necessarily better, of course, but in striving to be the best, 
host countries have elevated the Olympics far beyond the realm of sport, and 
they can't help but be better for it. 
</P>
<P>
Yeah, but what about Pete Rose, Ben Johnson, Mike Tyson getting all the wrong 
kind of publicity, the drug scandals in professional sports and the recruiting 
mess on the semi-pro level, the colleges? 
</P>
<P>
Not only are these individuals and incidents a sign of the times and highly 
predictable, but they also can be matched by equal indiscretions in any decade 
you care to name. A different set of circumstances, a different set of 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
Rose, Johnson, overdoses, rehab, strikes, boycotts, Wade Boggs, owners named 
Bob Irsay, Bill Bidwill and Al Davis -- put them all together they spell 
business as usual. It has been that way since 1951 and the college basketball 
point-shaving scandal. That was the end of the age of innocence as the 
importance of fun and games began growing out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
Instructed to recall the '80s, one's initial impressions aren't of McEnroe 
sassing a chair umpire in London, but of Boris Becker, at 17, crushing all who 
stood in his way there. 
</P>
<P>
For every Johnson and his experiments with substances bearing names containing 
53 letters, there are a thousand stories of athletes who tried and failed and 
tried again without cheating. 
</P>
<P>
It takes no more than a few moments to jot down the names of unforgettable 
performers who will have done a majority of their work during the '80s: 
</P>
<P>
Wayne Gretzky, Magic Johnson, Steffi Graf, Carl Lewis, George Brett, Greg 
LeMond, Larry Bird, Steve Largent, Greg Louganis, Joe Montana, Joan Benoit, 
Ivan Lendl, Michael Jordan, Katarina Witt, Mary Lou Retton, Mario Lemieux, Don 
Mattingly, Edwin Moses, David Robinson, Gabriela Sabatini, Orel Hershiser, 
Alberto Salazar, Diego Maradona, on and on. 
</P>
<P>
Then there are the people who were well-established a decade ago and just kept 
cruising along: Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova, Mike Schmidt, Mike Bossy, 
Jimmy Connors, Bart Conner, Dorothy Hamill, Bill Shoemaker, Jack Nicklaus, 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Larry Holmes and Nolan Ryan. 
</P>
<P>
And how about the teams? The San Francisco 49ers and Washington Redskins in pro 
football. Nebraska, Notre Dame and Miami in college football. The Lakers and 
Boston Celtics in pro basketball. Duke, Georgetown, North Carolina and Indiana 
among the collegians. First the New York Islanders, then the Edmonton Oilers in 
hockey. Any baseball team talented enough to stay on top for at least two years 
in this transient age. 
</P>
<P>
For all the warts discovered or uncovered by too-inquiring media, it is this 
same group of meddlers who have so popularized all of sport. Thus, for every 
sordid Wade Boggs yarn, there are glorious tales of Andre Ware, Bonnie Blair, 
Jim Craig, Gordon Johncock, Janet Evans, Alysheba and Villanova winning the 
NCAAs with a team expected to be a second-round loser. Better still, chances 
and a good sports director willing, you see it all on the TV that very night. 
</P>
<P>
Dark decade? Methinks not. While Ruth, Dempsey, Jones, Grange and Tilden made 
the '20s the "Golden Age of Sport," maybe Gretzky, Jordan, Payton and Tyson 
will qualify the '80s for silver or bronze. After all, a decade that started 
with a miracle and ends with Christmas and New Year's falling on Monday 
couldn't have been all bad.

ANALYZING STEELERS' TURNAROUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN REIMER, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An irrepressible quarterback with his chin stuck out, daring somebody to throw 
a punch. A tight-lipped coach with his jawline set, daring somebody to disrupt 
his stony composure. 
</P>
<P>
Bubby Brister and Chuck Noll, pro football's odd couple, are responsible for 
one of the more remarkable turnarounds in a pro football season -- and for the 
appearance of the Pittsburgh Steelers in the NFL playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Steelers were written off after they had opened the season with two 
embarrassing losses -- 51-0 to the Cleveland Browns and 41-10 to the Cincinnati 
Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
Neither Noll, who has coached the Steelers to four Super Bowl wins, nor 
Brister, who had only one winning season as a pro, lost hope, and now 
Pittsburgh is at the Astrodome today to play the Houston Oilers in the American 
Football Conference wild-card game. 
</P>
<P>
"He didn't freak out," Brister said of Noll. "When we lost the first two, he 
didn't go crazy. He didn't throw stuff or start cutting on the players or 
pointing fingers. He told us what we needed to do, and that was work harder, 
come earlier and stay longer. 
</P>
<P>
"He kept us together, and that's one reason why we're in the playoffs right 
now." 
</P>
<P>
"The one thing I respect most about Chuck is his consistency," said Pro Bowl 
tackle Tunch Ilkin. "He just stays the same. He's not going to panic. He's not 
going to quit, and I think the players sense that." 
</P>
<P>
The players seemed to believe Noll when he told them they were not as bad as 
those first two scores, and when Pittsburgh beat the Minnesota Vikings, 27-14, 
in the third week of the season, the turnaround had begun. 
</P>
<P>
"We, individually, had faith," said Noll. "It was a question of getting the 
confidence in one another, and that is gradually built throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
"They're building pride, and they came back and were not discouraged when 
everyone else was. That's an important element." 
</P>
<P>
With the two early losses to the AFC Central Division rivals came calls for 
Noll's firing. Fans said the game had passed by Noll, said Myron Cope, Steelers 
broadcaster and talk-show host. But Noll didn't seem to hear that. "What they 
are saying," Noll said, "is, 'Why aren't you winning more?' " 
</P>
<P>
Cope said, "Thanks to Emperor Chaz, as I like to call him, this team stayed 
right on course. He might have been the only guy in town who thought they 
would. He has blinders on like no coach I have ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
"Now the guy they wanted fired during the first half of the season is the guy 
they want for coach of the year." 
</P>
<P>
Noll's single-mindedness was evident Tuesday morning when the Steelers met for 
the first time after Minnesota's victory last Monday night over Cincinnati, 
which, in combination with Pittsburgh's victory over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
last Sunday, boosted the Steelers into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"He said, 'Congratulations,' and then he started talking about Houston," said 
Brister. "He didn't spend any time patting us on the back for Tampa Bay. He 
went right on to Houston." 
</P>
<P>
Noll kept his players focused, but this young team -- the Steelers are the 
youngest in the league, with 12 rookies and 30 players with three years of 
experience or fewer -- took its inspiration from Brister, with his almost manic 
optimism and his street-fighter posturing. 
</P>
<P>
"He doesn't take any stuff out there," Ilkin said. "He didn't let us get down. 
He's a hard-nosed guy, and everybody believes in him." 
</P>
<P>
Brister said, "We don't want to be just happy making the playoffs. We want to 
do a lot more. We want to shock the world. We want to go to the Super Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
To do that, Pittsburgh must first beat Houston, a team that has beaten the 
Steelers twice this season. Houston won easily in October, 27-0, at the 
Astrodome. But it took a last-minute touchdown to secure a 23-16 victory in 
December, making the Oilers the only team to defeat the Steelers during the 
final six weeks of the season. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers ended the season much as the Steelers had begun it, losing to 
Cincinnati and Cleveland by a combined score of 85-27. 
</P>
<P>
"We haven't been able to write the script," Noll said. "I don't think anybody 
would have (written it) the way our season has gone. It's kind of been stranger 
than fiction." 
</P>
<P>
Noll and Brister are not the only characters in this dramatic turnaround, from 
5-11 last season to 9-7 this year. 
</P>
<P>
First-round draft pick Tim Worley, who missed training camp in a contract 
dispute, ran for just 353 yards during the first 11 games of the season, 
fumbling often. 
</P>
<P>
"I was lost," said Worley. "But I've been playing pretty good in the last four 
weeks." 
</P>
<P>
He gained 417 yards in the last five weeks, as he learned to hold his eagerness 
in check and wait for the blocks set by an offensive line that features two 
more first-rounders, Tom Ricketts and John Rienstra, who finally are coming 
around. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive back Rod Woodson was the first-round pick who missed last year's 
training camp in a contract dispute. This year, he leads the league in kickoff 
returns with a 27.3-yard average and has four interceptions in a Steeler 
secondary that rekindles memories of the Super Bowl teams with its tough 
hitting. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Louis Lipps, voted the team's most valuable player by his 
teammates, gained 944 receiving yards and 180 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
Noll fired three assistants in the off-season and another resigned. Their 
replacements have been part of this turnaround. It took time for the players to 
learn, but defensive coordinator Rod Rust and linebackers coach Dave Brazil, 
who came together from the Kansas City Chiefs, have revamped a Steelers defense 
that has no superstars but is increasingly tough-tackling and stingy. 
</P>
<P>
George Stewart came from Notre Dame to take over a special-teams unit that gave 
up six blocked punts last year, an NFL record that doubled the old mark. This 
year, none of Harry Newsome's punts was blocked until the final game of the 
season, when Tampa Bay got one. 
</P>
<P>
"We've been improving every day, and we haven't peaked yet," Woodson said. 
"Teams that do well in the playoffs are hot right now."

NFL PLAYOFF PICTURE: IT'S THE NINERS AND NINE NOBODIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VITO STELLINO, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The San Francisco 49ers seem to be in a league of their own as they enter the 
NFL playoffs -- so much so that perhaps an appropriate title for this 
spectacular is the 49ers and the Nine Dwarfs. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, attempting to become the first team in a decade to repeat as Super 
Bowl champions, posted a 14-2 regular-season record. They were two games better 
than any other team in the league and beat four of the other nine playoff 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, one of six division champions with a bye today when the two 
wild-card games will be played, are on much more of a roll than they were a 
year ago, when they started 6-5, won four straight and then lost their 
regular-season finale to the Rams, 38-16. That loss knocked the New York Giants 
out of the playoffs, leading Giant quarterback Phil Simms to complain that he 
watched the 49ers "lay down like dogs" against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
This year, the 49ers routed the Chicago Bears, 26-0, in their finale, even 
though they already had clinched home-field advantage throughout the NFC 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"In some respects, that was a very decisive win. But, as coaches, we look at 
certain things that we can do better," said 49er Coach George Seifert. "And 
we'll have to do them better in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers do as well as they did in the regular season, that would be good 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
They even seem to have history on their side. The NFL has a record of ending a 
decade with a team winning back-to-back titles. 
</P>
<P>
The Philadelphia Eagles did it in 1948-49, the Baltimore Colts did it in 
1958-59 and the Pittsburgh Steelers did it in 1978-79. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers, who are considered by many to be the team of the decade, can join 
Pittsburgh as the only four-time Super Bowl champion. 
</P>
<P>
They also can become known as one of the best post-World War II teams, joining 
the 1946-55 Cleveland Browns, who won four titles in the old All-America 
Conference and three NFL titles; the Green Bay Packers of the 1960s, who won 
five titles and the first two Super Bowls, and the Steelers of the 1970s, who 
won four Super Bowls in six seasons. 
</P>
<P>
That's why all the focus is on the 49ers, who will play either the Philadelphia 
Eagles or the Minnesota Vikings in their first playoff game. If they win, 
they'd face either the Vikings, Giants or Rams in the NFC title game. 
</P>
<P>
Of those four teams, the Rams seem to have the best shot of upsetting the 
49ers. They handed the 49ers one of their two losses this season and could have 
swept them if they hadn't blown two 17-point leads in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
The problem for the Rams will be getting to the NFC title game. They will first 
have to win at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, then at Giants Stadium in East 
Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
The weather is likely to be nasty in both places, and the Rams aren't noted for 
playing well in cold weather. They barely beat the New England Patriots, 24-20, 
in Foxboro, Mass., on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers beat the Giants and Eagles during the regular season, and the Vikings 
would have to face San Francisco on the road at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers beat the Vikings, 34-9, in the playoffs last season. The Vikings, 
whose home is the Metrodome in Minneapolis, have become such a dome team that 
they're 1-8 in their last nine outdoor games. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings upset the 49ers two seasons ago in the playoffs, 36-24, at 
Candlestick when the 49ers were 13-2. But quarterback Joe Montana was rusty and 
ineffective in that game after being injured at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
Although he's had trouble with his ribs this season, Montana finished the 
season by hitting 10 of 21 passes against the Bears before coming out early in 
the third quarter. It wasn't vintage Montana, but it was good enough to enable 
him to set the record for quarterback rating, with 112.4. Milt Plum of the 
Cleveland Browns had the old mark of 110.4 in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
Montana also finished the season by completing 70.2 percent of his passes, the 
third-best mark in NFL history. Ken Anderson completed 70.55 of his passes in 
1982, the nine-game strike season, and Sammy Baugh completed 70.3 in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
If the 49ers hadn't pulled Montana so soon in the Bear game, he might have 
broken that record. 
</P>
<P>
"We didn't find out until there were three minutes left in the game," Seifert 
said. "Had we known earlier in the third period, we might have put him back in. 
But the plan was to do basically what we did." 
</P>
<P>
In the AFC, a team will qualify for the Super Bowl only because that's the way 
the system works. The Denver Broncos were the only team to win more than nine 
regular-season games. They finished 11-5 and are favored to go to the Super 
Bowl for the third time in the last four seasons. But they lost at home to the 
Eagles and Giants. 
</P>
<P>
Quarterback John Elway didn't have one of his better seasons, but Denver 
prospered when defensive coordinator Wade Phillips rebuilt the defense into a 
unit that ranked No. 2 in the AFC, No. 1 against the rush. 
</P>
<P>
The Broncos lost two of their last three games, and it may not be considered 
stunning if they lose in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The team that might have the best chance of beating them is the Cleveland 
Browns, who defeated the Vikings and Houston Oilers in the final two weeks of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
The addition of running back Kevin Mack, who was in jail on a drug charge 
earlier in the season, has added a dimension to the Browns' sputtering offense. 
</P>
<P>
Mack, who scored the winning touchdown against the Oilers with 39 seconds left 
Saturday night, said, "I guess when all the trouble started, it was hard to see 
ahead to the good times coming back again. But a lot of people believed in me, 
and now I'm back." 
</P>
<P>
At the start of the season, the Buffalo Bills and Oilers were given good shots 
of making the Super Bowl, but both teams are on the defensive after struggling 
down the stretch. The Bills lost three of their last four, and the Oilers lost 
their last two. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Coach Marv Levy said, 'We've been in first place for 32 straight games 
(two seasons). Sometimes it's hard to please people." 
</P>
<P>
That's mainly because they were only 9-7, and because the players don't seem to 
like quarterback Jim Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers also finished 9-7, and Houston Coach Jerry Glanville said, "We don't 
have to apologize for being one of the three (actually four) teams that have 
made the playoffs the last three years (along with the Browns, Vikings and 
49ers). There are 18 teams that wish they were in, but they're not." 
</P>
<P>
One team not apologizing is the Pittsburgh Steelers, the hottest team in the 
AFC. They won their last three games, although the games were against teams 
with losing records -- the New York Jets, Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

BOZ FACES COMEBACK FROM SHOULDER INJURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Brian Bosworth's heart is still into football, but he has nine months to prove 
to himself and the Seattle Seahawks that he still has the body to continue 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
The Boz' agent, Gary Wichard, said his client faces a difficult rehabilitation 
of his ailing right shoulder, where injuries have put his three-year career in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not a betting guy, but I would bet on him coming back," Wichard said. "If 
it's up to Brian Bosworth, he will work hard and be ready." 
</P>
<P>
Whether Bosworth can come back, and for how long, is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Bosworth damaged the joint in his right shoulder trying to make an arm tackle 
of Phoenix Cardinals fullback Ron Wolfley in the second game of the season. 
Though surgery wasn't required, Bosworth never played again. In 1988, he 
underwent arthroscopic surgery to remove a loose piece of cartilage that was 
floating in his left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
"Brian has two shoulder joints, and there are two deteriorated joints," Wichard 
said. "This year's problem is similar to the one last year except there isn't 
any cartilage floating in the joint that make it lock up. He just needs to 
rehab it like he did the left one."

SAN DIEGO SPORTS ET CETERA: ECHEVERRIA'S 21 POINTS GIVE HER USD CAREER LEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
Candida Echeverria made a pair of free throws late in an 84-62 victory over 
Arizona State Saturday night to become the University of San Diego's all-time 
leading women's basketball scorer. 
</P>
<P>
Echeverria, a senior guard, scored 21 points and led the Toreras (9-1) to their 
eighth consecutive victory at the USD Sports Center. 
</P>
<P>
Her 18th and 19th points, free throws with four minutes 18 seconds left, tied 
and broke the USD record of 1,010 points set by Debbie Theroux in 1983-86. 
Theroux is now an assistant for Coach Kathy Marpe. 
</P>
<P>
"She deserves it," Theroux said. "She works hard for every point she gets. We 
still have a half a year to go, so I'm sure she's going to add quite a bit to 
it." 
</P>
<P>
USD shot 46% from the field to just 27% for Arizona State, which lost for just 
the second time this season and is now 7-2. It was the first time USD has 
beaten the Sun Devils in four attempts. 
</P>
<P>
USD went up by as much as 17 points in the first half and led at halftime, 
44-32. ASU drew to within 51-41, but seven in a row for USD -- four on two 
17-foot jumpers by Angie Straub -- essentially put it away. 
</P>
<P>
Echeverria, who played only 26 minutes, had 13 points in the first half but did 
not score in the second until 7:11 remained. A 15-foot shot from the left 
baseline and a driving layup off an assist from Paula Mascari (16 points) put 
her within one of the record. 
</P>
<P>
Echeverria was set up for the record when she took a pass on a fast break and 
was fouled attempting a layup. 
</P>
<P>
In the Toreras' first game, Echeverria broke the school mark for free throws in 
a career. JIM LINDGREN

COFFEE GROUNDS; 
</P>
<P>
BACK-YARD GARDENER BREWS BREAKTHROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Renato L. Siong was browsing at a local nursery, looking for yet another 
tropical plant to add to the forest of fruits and vegetables growing in his 
back yard in Long Beach, when he saw a forlorn green pot tossed on a trash 
heap. 
</P>
<P>
Siong, who was a professor of agriculture for 25 years in the Philippines, knew 
at first glance that the outcast was a coffee plant. The nursery had thrown it 
away because no one would buy it -- naturally. Coffee only grows in tropical 
climes like the mountains of Colombia and the shores of Hawaii, not in smoggy, 
suburban Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
Wanna bet? 
</P>
<P>
Siong took that plant and 19 others back to his Oregon Avenue house and planted 
them all over the yard three years ago to see if he could do the impossible -- 
harvest coffee in Southern California as he had for 10 years in the 
Philippines, drying it, roasting it, grinding it, brewing it, drinking it and 
even selling the surplus to friends. 
</P>
<P>
Several months later, the plant on the west side of the cluttered yard set 
beneath a skinny peach tree sprouted dozens of round green beans, proving that 
coffee does indeed grow in filtered Southern California sunlight and 
catapulting Siong to the revered position of Long Beach's own Juan Valdez. 
</P>
<P>
"Look at that!" Siong shrieked, holding a green leaf in his thick, weathered 
hand. "You do not have to go to Colombia to get those berries! Probably anybody 
here can grow coffee." 
</P>
<P>
The Arabica beans, which appeared with little fertilizer, morning shade and 
partial sun after 1 p.m., are said to be the most aromatic grade of coffee 
grown today. "The kind that wakes you up like this," Siong said, sniffing the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
There would seem to be a gold mine brewing considering the following: the 
coffee plant requires little care, its dark, shiny leaves bear a striking 
resemblance to the ficus tree and it sprouts delicate white flowers after 
bearing fruit. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 52% of Americans drink an average of three cups of coffee a 
day, and gourmet, grind-your-own beans are practically a yuppie staple. 
</P>
<P>
But Siong is not likely to publish what he believes is an agricultural 
breakthrough. His impressive credentials in the Philippines, where he earned a 
master's degree in agricultural biochemistry and served as a consultant to the 
council on agriculture, are not recognized here, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Siong, 51, works as a gardener for the Long Beach Unified School District and 
conducts his plant research in the cramped back yard of his home in North Long 
Beach, where he brought his wife and four children six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
"Do these look like the hands of a professor of 25 years?" he asked, turning up 
two soiled and rugged palms. "Is that not something?" 
</P>
<P>
He is a frustrated scholar full of ideas on how to grow fruits and vegetables 
uncommon to Southern California, although he claims they taste better and make 
more efficient use of the land. His yard overflows with hundreds of green pots 
and plowed plots of garlic, Japanese persimmons and macadamia nuts. 
</P>
<P>
Kang kong, a plant similar to $3-a-pound watercress, grows with abandon and can 
be harvested every 29 days. Malungay, rich in vitamin A and used to flavor 
stews in the Philippines, costs more than a dollar here for four small cuttings 
but thrives near Siong's back fence. Pommelo, like grapefruit but twice the 
size and with no bitter taste, hangs heavy from his small tree. 
</P>
<P>
The coffee plant, however, is his pride and joy, although he has not yet tasted 
it. When the tree first bore fruit last year, Siong had no coffee grinder. So 
he threw the beans around the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
This time, he plans to roast and grind them, and if his success in his native 
home is any indication, "it will be a cup of coffee as good as any grown in 
Colombia." 
</P>
<P>
High marks from a man who could surely be considered a coffee aficionado, if 
not for one small detail -- he also drinks instant. 
</P>

ROARS FROM DOUGLAS' TESTS OF JET ENGINES BRING PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

LAKEWOOD 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At Ed Roebuck's house on Warwood Road just east of Paramount Boulevard, 
vibrations from the noise are so intense that the putty in his sliding glass 
doors "jumps out," Roebuck says. 
</P>
<P>
At nearby Lakewood County Golf Course, the snarling roar shakes the pro shop 
and sends blood pressures spiraling. "You can be playing on the seventh green 
and practically fall over when (the noise) stops," golf pro Tom Petersen says. 
</P>
<P>
On Greenmeadow Road, 20-year resident Richard Depperman says the noise is 
getting so bad he bought a device to measure sound levels. 
</P>
<P>
And the city of Lakewood -- worried about a growing number of complaints -- has 
hired a consultant to study the problem. 
</P>
<P>
The roar that has for years periodically engulfed the southwest corner of 
Lakewood and parts of Long Beach occurs when nearby Douglas Aircraft tests the 
jet engines on its new airplanes. 
</P>
<P>
The tests, residents say, can last for up to 30 minutes, shaking buildings, 
drowning out the sound on their televisions and making conversation impossible. 
The area most affected, according to residents, stretches north from the 
Douglas test site to Del Amo Boulevard and is bounded roughly by Lakewood and 
Paramount boulevards on the east and west. 
</P>
<P>
Roebuck, an avid golfer, says he is particularly upset that the testing 
position of the jet planes sends exhaust and noise directly over the county 
golf course. 
</P>
<P>
"You can smell the jet fuel all over the golf course. . . . I just think it's 
terrible that (it) has to absorb all that punishment," Roebuck said. Even 
though his house is built next to the golf course, he said, he often plays on 
other courses to avoid the sound and smell of the engine tests. 
</P>
<P>
"The whole situation is that Douglas is a sacred cow," says Roebuck, a former 
Dodgers pitcher who scouts for the Cincinnati Reds. "Nobody wants to give them 
a hard time. They employ a lot of people around here." 
</P>
<P>
Since 1940, the Douglas plant has straddled the border between Long Beach and 
Lakewood and sprawled out around the runways of Long Beach Airport, another 
noisy neighbor. An estimated 35,000 people work at Douglas, a division of 
McDonnell Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
The Long Beach Airport receives about seven calls a month from Lakewood 
residents complaining about the Douglas testing, said Rod Dinger, the airport's 
senior noise control specialist. In November, Long Beach residents also filed 
23 complaints about the noise. Overall, the airport received 119 complaints in 
November about noise from flights at the airport and Douglas testing. 
</P>
<P>
The city of Long Beach, which leases parcels of its airport property to 
Douglas, has limited testing. Douglas is allowed to test planes between 7 a.m. 
and 9 p.m. on weekdays. No testing is allowed before 9 a.m. on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
The airport, said Dinger, is exploring the possibility of moving the test site 
from the edge of the airport property toward the center and perhaps building a 
hangar for the testing. However, he emphasized that the idea is in the 
exploration stage, and that it would take two years to get the necessary 
approvals from the city and the federal government before a hangar could be 
built. 
</P>
<P>
Donald N. Hanson, Douglas' manager of public relations, said: "We have done 
what we can to keep the noise down. We try to be as accommodating as we can, 
but at the same time we have to go on producing aircraft." 
</P>
<P>
The consultant, Thomas W. Fitzwater of Michael Brandman Associates in Santa 
Ana, says he has had little luck in getting Douglas to be specific on how many 
hours a week it tests. However, the firm did give Fitzwater some advance notice 
on tests so that he could record the decibel levels produced by the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Resident Depperman says he has learned from talking to people who know the 
industry that an engine must be tested eight hours before being handed over to 
its new owner. 
</P>
<P>
But Hanson, the Douglas spokesman, said the test hours can vary significantly. 
</P>
<P>
Before a plane takes flight, Hanson said, the engine is tested on the ground at 
various thrust levels until it functions smoothly at each level. "Sometimes it 
takes a few minutes, sometimes a lot longer," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
The plant, according to Hanson, is turning out its MD80, a twin engine 
commercial jet transport plane, at a rate of 2.5 per week. 
</P>
<P>
Chuck Ebner, Lakewood's planning and development director, acknowledged that 
Douglas' economic position in the community has helped insulate the company 
from public criticism. The insulation, however, may be unraveling because of 
accelerated production schedules and new airplane designs. 
</P>
<P>
Both Fitzwater and Depperman point out that Douglas has also started producing 
its MD11, a model that has a third engine mounted on the plane's fuselage. They 
believe that the third engine is adding to the noise problem because the engine 
is higher than the massive concrete slabs, known as blast fences, that are 
positioned along the testing field to deflect jet exhaust and sound. 
</P>
<P>
Fitzwater says the fences are used primarily to catch debris and do little to 
reduce noise. But Hanson says Douglas started testing MD11s only a couple weeks 
ago, that the third engine is not higher than the blast fence and that the 
fences do deflect noise. 
</P>
<P>
Hanson also pointed out that peak production for the plant was reached in the 
early '70s and that Douglas has produced other models that had third engines on 
the fuselage. He also noted that new federal noise restrictions have resulted 
in quieter engines than were produced a decade or two ago. 
</P>
<P>
The noise complaints, Hanson said, usually occur on days when there are 
atmospheric conditions that hold the noise down and push it outward. "It 
depends on the winds, the temperature and even the cloud cover sometimes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In the course of its study, Lakewood has discovered that the current Douglas 
test site lies within the city's municipal boundary, though the Long Beach 
Airport owns the parcel and leases it to Douglas. Lakewood and its consultant, 
Ebner said, are exploring what legal steps the city can take to reduce test 
noise that originates within municipal boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
Though he has not yet completed his report to the Lakewood council, consultant 
Fitzwater said possible solutions include requiring that tests be conducted in 
a building, moving the test site to another location, imposing stricter time 
limits on testing, or using new materials in sound barriers to help control 
noise.

POLITICS: LIVING IN THE GOVERNOR'S HOME AREA IS A DEFINITE ASSET WHEN IT COMES 
TO GETTING NAMED TO A CALIFORNIA PANEL OR COMMISSION, A REVIEW OF GUBERNATORIAL

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
When Gov. George Deukmejian takes a number to wait in line at a barbershop near 
his Long Beach home, he gets his hair cut by Robert O. Boulding, a member of 
the Board of Barber Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
When he attends services at All Saints Episcopal Church in Long Beach, 
Deukmejian listens to sermons delivered by the Rev. William A. Thompson, 
chairman of the Board of Behavioral Science Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
When the governor returns to his Belmont Shore neighborhood, he can wave hello 
to James A. Woodward, who lives across the street and is a Deukmejian appointee 
to the Medical Assistance Commission, which oversees Medi-Cal contracts. 
</P>
<P>
Living near the governor seems to be one of the easiest ways to land a job on a 
state board or commission. Based on a review of 2,923 current members of boards 
and commissions obtained from the governor's office, Deukmejian's 90803 ZIP 
code has the highest number of appointees -- 26 -- of any in Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>
<P>
After the governor's, the county's other ZIP codes with clout are: well-to-do 
communities on the Palos Verdes Peninsula in ZIP code 90274, with 16 
appointees. Next in line, with 13 appointees, is ZIP code 90049, covering 
Westwood, Brentwood and Bel-Air in West Los Angeles. Beverly Hills' 90210 ZIP 
code and another section of Long Beach in ZIP code 90815 follow, with 11 
appointees each. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor feels the state ends just south of Long Beach, but he's not 
exactly sure where," cracked Robert C. Fellmeth, a University of San Diego law 
professor and expert on state boards and commissions. 
</P>
<P>
Terrance Flanigan, a San Diego native who is Deukmejian's appointments 
secretary, minimized the degree to which geography enters into the selection 
process. Said Flanigan: "If you had a governor from the Central Valley or from 
somewhere in Northern California . . . it probably would surprise no one if a 
large number of appointments were from that area." 
</P>
<P>
As governor, "you can appoint people to positions who you are familiar with" 
and whose judgment you rely upon. "This is one of the prerogatives you have as 
a governor," Flanigan said. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County -- with an estimated 30% of the state's population -- has 
about 500 appointments -- only about 16% of the statewide total, according to a 
review of the figures. 
</P>
<P>
About 120 Deukmejian appointees live in the Southeast/Long Beach area. 
</P>
<P>
The ZIP codes with the highest number of Deukmejian appointees are in the 
Sacramento area, where many officials move to serve in full-time posts. For 
example, one ZIP code area has 78 appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian must fill hundreds of spots on about 375 boards and commissions. 
Some are low-profile, part-time panels such as the Board of Home Furnishings, 
for which members are paid $100 a meeting plus expenses. Others are 
high-profile, full-time, policy-making bodies such as the Public Utilities 
Commission, whose members earn $83,868 annually. 
</P>
<P>
Interviews with about two dozen appointees provide an insight into the various 
ways that Deukmejian fills slots in his Administration. Capturing a 
gubernatorial appointment can be as easy as popping into Boulding's Long Beach 
barbershop when the governor is having his hair trimmed. For others, the task 
is more difficult, prompting them to enlist friends and political movers and 
shakers to lobby the governor's office on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
A seat on even the most arcane board can be a political prize that signals 
clout, access to the governor or prestige. It also can mean that an appointee 
has expertise in a specialized field or is close to the governor's conservative 
Republican philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
Long Beach appointees, in particular, may have a more parochial agenda -- to 
help a neighbor whose political star they have watched rise since he was 
elected to the Assembly in 1962. Many met Deukmejian when they moved to the 
comfortable Belmont Shore section of Long Beach, launched careers, began 
families and joined service clubs, the PTA and other groups. Some of their 
children were baby-sitters for his children. One appointee's husband coached 
Deukmejian's son's baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian also had business ties to some of his appointees. Fred Riedman, 
Deukmejian's former law partner, sits on the Board of the Museum of Science and 
Industry. Another former law partner, Malcolm M. Lucas, was named by Deukmejian 
as chief justice of the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Long Beach appointees are in much lower-profile, unpaid positions. 
Nonetheless, with 67 appointments, Long Beach has seven more appointments than 
even San Diego, California's second-largest city, with more than twice the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
Fellmeth, director of the USD Center for Public Interest Law, said it is not 
surprising that Deukmejian has picked a high number of state officials from 
Long Beach. Knowledge of an applicant, he said, is a critical factor in 
selecting political appointees. 
</P>
<P>
Thompson, who officiated at the wedding of Deukmejian's daughter, Leslie, 
agreed. "Frankly, my interpretation of it is, when you have some appointments 
to make . . . it's probably only natural that you seek out people who you have 
some familiarity with," he said. Thompson sits on the board that certifies 
social workers and licenses other types of counselors. 
</P>
<P>
Timing, Circumstances 
</P>
<P>
Despite an application and screening process designed to find the best 
candidates for the jobs, Flanigan, the governor's appointments secretary, 
acknowledged that on occasion a decision hinges on timing and circumstance. 
</P>
<P>
Consider the case of David G. Camp. 
</P>
<P>
Camp, who owned a menswear store, first met Deukmejian when he was a Belmont 
Shore lawyer. His daughter was a baby-sitter for the Deukmejian family. In a 
recent interview, Camp said that after Deukmejian's 1982 election victory, he 
was approached about an appointment but was too busy with his business. 
</P>
<P>
A year ago, after Camp had sold his store, he bumped into Deukmejian at 
Boulding's Belmont Shore barbershop. As they waited for a haircut, the governor 
and Camp discussed politics and Deukmejian's future. When Deukmejian settled 
into the barber chair, Camp said, Boulding asked the governor: " 'How about 
Dave filling a vacancy on the barber board?' " 
</P>
<P>
Camp recalled that the governor asked him whether he would be interested in the 
post. Camp replied positively and about three days later got a letter 
announcing the appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Flanigan cautioned: "That's certainly not how all the appointments are made," 
but joked, "What better advice can you get (than) from your personal barber?" 
</P>
<P>
Boulding said he has cut the governor's hair regularly since the early 1970s. 
Because Deukmejian now stays in Sacramento much of the time, he gives the 
governor a trim only about four or five times a year. "We're not an appointment 
shop," Boulding said, so the governor takes a number and waits in line like any 
other customer. 
</P>
<P>
Boulding, who moved from Long Beach to El Toro 10 years ago, said that about 
six months after Deukmejian was elected, "he was in on a Saturday morning and 
asked me if I would be interested in serving on the Board of Barber Examiners." 
</P>
<P>
It was almost as easy for a Deukmejian neighbor, James Woodward, who markets 
high-tech equipment to hospitals, to get named to his $44,898-a-year post on 
the Medical Assistance Commission. The panel contracts with health-care 
providers to deliver services to low-income and elderly people in the Medi-Cal 
program. 
</P>
<P>
Woodward said he met the governor 12 years ago when he moved onto Deukmejian's 
block. Deukmejian's three children at various times have been baby-sitters for 
the Woodwards' children, Woodward said. "We're neighbors. You say 'Hi' to them. 
Once in awhile invite him over to chat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
About a year ago, Woodward said, he told the governor that he may have some 
time to serve on a state board, but did not seek a specific assignment. 
Woodward described his commission position as "just another job. I don't get 
any ego satisfaction out of it. I'm just a quiet person who is doing a job." 
</P>
<P>
Others, such as Al Taucher, a member of the Fish and Game Commission, have 
known Deukmejian for 30 years. Taucher said he unsuccessfully sought a seat on 
the commission from then-Gov. Ronald Reagan. Taucher, who owned a Long Beach 
sporting goods store, said his neighborhood "might have more people . . . who 
have his (Deukmejian's) ear," but dismissed suggestions that appointees 
exercise political clout. 
</P>
<P>
Influence Seen 
</P>
<P>
However, Charles G. Bell, author of a textbook on state government, said he 
believes gubernatorial appointees can wield influence either with the governor 
or in setting public policy. "The appointee may very well be at a reception at 
the governor's home or some social function that gives them a point of access 
that other kinds of individuals don't have," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Long Beach Mayor Ernie Kell said, "The general consensus is that 
Long Beach wasn't helped that much" by the appointments. The one exception, he 
asserted, is Bryan W. Littlefield, who manages an area beer distributorship and 
has used a seat on the Arts Council to promote local arts programs. 
</P>
<P>
Former Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian, a one-time Deukmejian 
aide who now serves on the Council on Criminal Justice and the Board of 
Corrections, dismissed suggestions that appointees have special access to 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor listens to a lot of people, but he makes up his own mind. There's 
no such thing as clout or having the governor's ear," maintained Philibosian, 
who lives in Tarzana in the ZIP code 91356 -- with seven appointments 
representing the most of any San Fernando Valley ZIP code. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian has named a large number of fellow Armenian-Americans, including 
Philibosian, to state boards and commissions. Marvin Baxter, an 
Armenian-American who served as Deukmejian's former appointments secretary, 
said the governor credits the Armenian community with providing "the support he 
needed to be a viable candidate," especially in the 1982 Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
Richard R. Terzian of Westwood, who sits on the Commission on California State 
Government Organization and Economy, said, "All governors wind up giving 
appointments to people who are early and faithful supporters." 
</P>
<P>
Even though Terzian supported Deukmejian and helped raise money for his 1978 
attorney general's campaign, he did not immediately win an appointment. He 
sought one in 1983 or 1984, but it was several years later before he was named 
to the commission, better known as the Little Hoover Commission. "What I did 
was I asked people I knew . . . who also knew the governor and who supported 
the governor and other people prominent in the community to write letters" on 
his behalf. 
</P>
<P>
Some Deukmejian appointees have become engulfed in controversy even after 
winning spots on state panels. For instance, earlier this month Marianthi 
Lansdale, wife of Long Beach developer William M. Lansdale, apologized after it 
was reported that she had misstated her academic credentials when she told the 
governor's office that she had received an associate of arts degree from Long 
Beach City College in 1959. 
</P>
<P>
Some Blocked 
</P>
<P>
Seats on high-profile and full-time boards usually require Senate confirmation. 
Sometimes the confirmation hearings spark disputes that result in an 
appointment being blocked. 
</P>
<P>
For example, in early 1988 the Senate Rules Committee rejected the 
reappointment of Angie L. Papadakis of Rancho Palos Verdes to a second term on 
the State Board of Education. She was criticized by lawmakers for opposing 
bilingual education programs. 
</P>
<P>
Papadakis said that after her rejection she was reluctant to take another state 
post, explaining, "I wanted to go on a cruise. I didn't want to be tied down to 
another responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, later in 1988 Deukmejian named her to the California-Nevada 
Superspeed Ground Transportation Commission, which is seeking to attract a 
private company to build a 300-mile-an-hour train between Las Vegas and 
Anaheim. Senate confirmation was not required. 
</P>
<P>
When a Deukmejian aide queried her about her interest in the commission, 
Papadakis recalled telling him she didn't know anything about trains. She said 
the staffer asked: "Do you drive a car? Have you ever been stuck on a freeway? 
. . . Then you qualify." Papadakis said she has never received a call from 
Deukmejian telling her how to vote. "Once he appoints us, he gives us our 
head," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Some Deukmejian appointees concede that others might have more expertise to sit 
on a board or commission. "There are hundreds and hundreds . . . who are 
probably more qualified than I am," declared Tirso del Junco of Pasadena, a 
Deukmejian appointee to the University of California Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
Del Junco said that after Deukmejian was elected governor he received a letter 
asking if he was interested in a state appointment. He recalled voicing an 
interest in the Regents. But Del Junco speculated that his political ties -- he 
is a former State Republican Party chairman -- and the Administration's desire 
to name a physician to the Regents may have prompted his appointment. 
</P>
<P>
Del Junco minimized the importance of his address in landing an appointment. 
So, too, did George Fenimore, a Deukmejian appointee to the Fair Political 
Practices Commission, who lives in Brentwood on the Westside. "I could have 
lived in Tarzana or Watts. It's just a coincidence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Even so, there seem to be differences among cities with roughly similar 
populations. For instance, Pasadena, with an estimated population of 138,000, 
has 20 Deukmejian appointees serving on state panels, whereas Pomona, with an 
estimated population of 117,800, has only two, according to data supplied by 
Deukmejian's office. 
</P>
<P>
After being told of the difference, Pomona Mayor Donna Smith said: "I would say 
that Pomona is definitely under-represented as far as the governor's 
appointments." She said Pomona, with a large, ethnically diverse and low-income 
population, "would love to be represented and have our voice heard." 
</P>
<P>
Back in Long Beach, barber Boulding, who has a picture of himself with the 
governor hanging in his shop, said he encourages critics to drop by the shop 
for a chat with Deukmejian. "He listens real thoroughly to people's ideas," 
Boulding said.

LEADERS' SONS WORK TO MOLD NEW ROMANIA

<TEXT>
<P>
The most striking feature of the new interim government of Romania, created 
amid the chaos of the bloody uprising last week, is that many of its leaders 
are the reform-minded sons of once-influential Communists who served the 
executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, according to U.S. and academic 
specialists. 
</P>
<P>
Their program appears to be to make Romania into a West European-style social 
democracy. They also speak of improving relations with both East and West, but 
they have already turned to the Soviet Union for "massive" aid, apparently in 
the form of oil to generate electricity and heat to see them through the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
Their links to communism, which have already been attacked by anti-Communist 
Romanians and which will probably be the major issue in elections promised for 
April, have made the U.S. government cautious about embracing the new Romania. 
</P>
<P>
"We like their program, and we will be following closely how well they 
implement it," a senior State Department official said last week. The United 
States has recognized the interim government, he said, "but we will calibrate 
the warmth of the U.S. relationship with the new government according to their 
performance." 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to doubt their commitment," he added, "but remember, these 
men have come up within a different system. Most of them were associated with 
the Ceausescu regime, not with its worst practices, but with the idea of 
monopoly control over the political process. 
</P>
<P>
"It's valid to ask how content they will be to allow a free press to function, 
for example, leading up to the elections. A psychological change on their part, 
at least, must take place to allow their program to be fully carried out," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
How the inexperienced new government will handle the welter of political, 
economic and foreign issues ahead is unknowable. Some experts are pessimistic, 
others optimistic. What is clear, however, as another U.S. official said, is 
that "the easy part -- the revolution -- is over. Now the tough part begins." 
</P>
<P>
The new government's 10-point program promises to eliminate the single, 
Communist Party state in favor of "a democratic and pluralistic system;" hold 
April elections; separate the legislative, executive and judiciary powers of 
government and limit officeholders to two terms; restructure the economy on 
"the criteria of profitability and efficiency;" restructure agriculture to 
favor small-scale, peasant production; guarantee minority rights; and 
reorganize the country's education, trade and foreign policies. 
</P>
<P>
Romania's new prime minister, Petre Roman, 43, was a professor of hydroelectric 
engineering. His father, Valter, was an early Communist militant who served as 
a minister in the postwar Romanian government, was purged as a suspected 
"Titoist," rehabilitated in 1953 but since has been relegated to running a 
political publishing house. 
</P>
<P>
The new foreign minister is Sergiu Celac, a career diplomat also in his 
mid-forties, who was Ceausescu's interpreter for 10 years. His father was also 
an important party functionary, and both he and Roman attended the same high 
school, which was largely restricted to the children of the elite. 
</P>
<P>
President of the National Salvation Council, a broad-based group approaching 
100 members which appointed the new government, is Ion Iliescu, 59, once a 
middle-level official in Ceausescu's government but demoted in 1968 by 
Ceausescu for his veiled criticism. Iliescu attended Moscow University at the 
same time as Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and they reportedly are 
friends from those days. 
</P>
<P>
One of the founders of the council and a key member of its executive committee 
is Silviu Brucan, 73, a longtime Communist purged by Ceausescu in 1966 and 
recently under house arrest for joining five other veteran party members in 
criticizing the late dictator. 
</P>
<P>
Typical of the criticism heard against the new government was that of a former 
political prisoner, Valentine Gabrielescu, 68, and a member of the council. 
</P>
<P>
"These Communists push themselves and one another forward," he complained. 
"These are the types who will try to put a rosy face on communism." 
</P>
<P>
But Brucan, who is the senior strategist of the new government, said that "the 
people on the council who were Communists are not there as such. They are there 
because they have been fighting the party. None would declare himself as a 
Communist. There is none of this reform-Communist nonsense in Romania." 
</P>
<P>
"Change in Romania did not come out of a reform movement within the party," he 
added. "The changes came as a result of a popular struggle without a political 
leadership. It was in the fire of the mass movement that the new leadership was 
formed." His words have not satisfied all of those masses. Some have blatantly 
challenged the authority of members of the new government. "Who elected you?" 
shouted one man during a speech. 
</P>
<P>
Explanations vary on how the new leaders got there. Iliescu and Roman emerged 
during the first demonstrations in the capital's streets, according to reports 
from Bucharest. Some accounts said that at one point a student protester 
shouted: "Here's a professor, let him speak!" This led to Roman's becoming a 
member of the council, whose executive committee named him prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
"Roman was chosen because he is a very highly educated man," said Brucan in an 
interview with the Financial Times of London. "He is a very brave man who 
distinguished himself Thursday night (Dec. 21). He is also young and 
good-looking." The full council could not decide who should be prime minister, 
so its 11-member executive committee decided, Brucan added. 
</P>
<P>
The similar backgrounds of the top leadership and the intertwining circles in 
which they moved, however, raised suspicions that their choice was not quite so 
haphazard as pictured and even that the new leaders may have conspired in some 
way before the popular uprising against Ceausescu. The evidence is 
circumstantial. 
</P>
<P>
Iliescu has the same technical speciality as Roman and they often met socially 
and professionally, according to Vladimir Timeaneanu, a Romanian scholar who 
attended the same high school with Roman and Celac. They were members of an 
informal study group on "the impact of technology on society" which was 
organized and led by Brucan. Iliescu, in another connection, was a close 
admirer of Roman's father. 
</P>
<P>
Celac, besides his school ties with Roman, is related through marriage to a 
famous mathematician and dissident, Mihai Botez, who has been called "the 
Romanian Sakharov," according to Timeaneanu, who is a resident fellow at the 
Foreign Policy Research Institute in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
The new prime minister and the new foreign minister would have socialized 
closely enough so "each had a very good idea of how everyone else stood," he 
added. There is no evidence that they planned a coup or fomented an uprising 
against Ceausescu, but "it's hard to believe that they were not personally 
prepared for their hour when it came," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Timeaneanu predicted that the new government would be "Eurocommunist and 
internationalist in its orientation, because the socialist ideal for Romania is 
still relevant to these men." They will run hard for election in April, rather 
than step aside when the interim government is over, he said, because "these 
men did not come to power just to renounce it." 
</P>
<P>
But they must perform well in the interim. The government, according to Brucan, 
"must start with food, with electricity, with gas. These are the priorities. We 
must show very vivid and evident improvements in the level of material life of 
the people. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"We won't act to lift the barriers against private enterprise until after the 
elections. It is a matter of focus -- you can't both improve material life 
quickly and institute deep economic reform." 
</P>
<P>
In foreign policy, Brucan said, Romania will now comply fully with the human 
and political rights guaranteed in the Helsinki Accords -- it had been the 
major violator in Eastern Europe -- and will seek to improve relations with 
both the United States and the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
"We will get very, very massive help from Gorbachev; that has been made clear," 
he added. "He has troubles of his own but he can afford what we need in terms 
of energy. We will improve relations with the United States and we expect to 
get back our most-favored-nation (trading) status" which was withdrawn because 
of Ceausescu's human rights abuses. 
</P>
<P>
But satisfying the populace will not be easy. "It is doubtful that reforming 
Marxists will be able to retain control indefinitely over a Romanian population 
that is traditionally anti-Communist, anti-Russian and anti-Hungarian," 
according to Prof. Mary Ellen Fischer of Skidmore College. 
</P>
<P>
Among its other problems, she wrote recently, Romania has no tradition of 
multi-party politics but now has an "all-powerful army" since it sided with the 
popular uprising rather than with Ceausescu and his security forces. In her 
view, Romania has such a strong tradition of military and authoritarian rule 
that it "runs a greater risk than any other East European country of slipping 
eventually into military dictatorship." 
</P>
<P>
The new defense minister is Gen. Nicolae Militaru, a professional soldier who 
retired several years ago. The interior minister is Lt. Gen. Mihai Ghitac, 
about whom key U.S. agencies know nothing. A third military man high in the new 
government is Col. Gen. Matanasie Stanculescu, who had been first deputy 
defense minister and is now in charge of the national economy. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything is in the balance in Romania now, the military most of all," a 
knowledgeable U.S. official said. It may be tempted to seize power if it fears 
anarchy in the freewheeling election debates that are expected. 
</P>
<P>
"The Romanian army must avoid giving in to its baser instincts by resorting to 
Bonapartism, the use of its power," the official added. "Just as the 
ex-Communists must resist trying to keep control of the levers of political 
power -- sharing information rather than managing it. They'll have to learn 
that 'people power' means power sharing." 
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, maybe we're overly skeptical," he added. "Eastern Europeans 
do know who Jefferson was. They have a sense of democracy, if only stemming 
from the bankruptcy of Marxism. Let's see how it plays out before writing them 
off." 
</P>
<P>
The other major issue in Romanian politics is nationalism. It got a bad name 
under Ceausescu, who used it to justify his repressive human rights and 
economic policies. Moreover, Romanians and their large minorities of 
Hungarians, Germans and others were strikingly unified in the fighting to 
depose the dictator. 
</P>
<P>
But ethnic tensions are almost certain to reassert themselves and be seized 
upon by politicians in future elections, if not the April balloting. A 
Hungarian people's party and similar ethnic groupings have already emerged, 
along with a peasant Christian party that emphasizes its religious orientation. 
</P>
<P>
A rise in anti-Semitism -- long a feature of Romanian life -- is anticipated by 
several analysts, in part in reaction to the fact that a number of Jews served 
in influential positions at various times during Ceausescu's rule and are 
visible in high posts in the interim government now. 
</P>
<P>
But the appeal to recover "lost lands" annexed by the Soviet Union will 
probably be the most significant single nationalist issue. Ceausescu, a few 
months before he fell, announced that the Hitler-Stalin Pact of 1939 was 
"illegal in all its consequences." One of those consequences was the Soviet 
takeover of the Romanian province of Bessarabia and its incorporation as 
Moldavia into the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. experts predicted that Romanian politicians, once Ceausescu's words 
have faded, will begin making pilgrimages to that region as they run for 
office.

APARTHEID SPLITS AFRIKANER PARENTS, ACTIVIST DAUGHTER

Hennie and Evelynne Durr are parents not easily rattled. So they didn't panic 
when the university letter arrived at their wine grape farm last May with 
police photographs of their daughter leading an illegal anti-apartheid march on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
Hennie Durr did as he felt any father would do: He called the school president 
to apologize and reminded daughter Leslee that rules are rules. 
</P>
<P>
That, he figured, was that. But as it turned out that was only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee was expelled a few weeks later, then reinstated after a storm of 
protest, and then arrested by police during yet another protest march. 
</P>
<P>
"Who can be proud of a criminal record?" her father remembers thinking. And it 
bothered him that the money he spent on his daughter's education was indirectly 
promoting the struggle for a socialist state and black majority rule. 
</P>
<P>
"I can't support ideologies that want to destroy what I believe in," he told 
her as he cut off her financial support. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of families in South Africa's ruling white Afrikaner society 
today -- like many American families in the Vietnam War era -- are being sorely 
tested by a political generation gap unlike any in the history of their 
civilization. 
</P>
<P>
The radicalized younger generation of whites, who have helped to lead a 
dramatic leftward shift in white thinking in this country, tussles daily with 
the older generation over the dinner table in privileged homes like the Durrs'. 
And the parents, good and solid citizens who have worked hard to mold a secure 
future for their families, are torn between admiration for their children's 
commitment to a cause and fear that the cause itself will destroy everything 
they hold dear. 
</P>
<P>
Politics is more than a parlor game in these days of dramatic change in South 
Africa. It touches the future of every family, black and white, and is the 
prime topic of conversation among strangers as well as friends. But Afrikaner 
families have developed internal shields against the divisiveness of politics. 
</P>
<P>
"Afrikaners have a strong sense of family," said Andre Brink, the Afrikaner 
novelist who wrote "A Dry White Season." "Politically, I represent everything 
that is reprehensible to my parents and them to me. But we love each other and 
we're prepared to pretend that a whole dimension doesn't exist altogether." 
</P>
<P>
The Durrs are a typically warm Afrikaner family rocked by political 
differences. Daughter Leslee, one of the country's best-known campus activists, 
works for radical, overnight change in South Africa while her father fears that 
unbridled change and a black government would ride the country to ruin. 
</P>
<P>
Hennie and Evelynne Durr say they have come to believe that, in the interests 
of peace, blacks must be given a say in national affairs. And they support 
President Frederik W. de Klerk, who promises to end apartheid but still protect 
whites from "black domination" and resist all attempts to install a socialist 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
The Durrs' 22-year-old daughter, however, supports the socialist ideals and 
guerrilla warfare of black liberation groups such as the outlawed African 
National Congress (ANC). 
</P>
<P>
She has joined other whites in meeting the ANC at its exile headquarters and 
considers black nationalist Nelson R. Mandela, held in a prison only five miles 
from her family's home, the leader of the country. She says De Klerk's promises 
are "really just another layer of paint to buy time" for the white minority-led 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Until this year, the Durrs led a quiet family life in their white Cape Dutch 
farmhouse in the lap of a gentle mountain range in the heart of South Africa's 
vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
Hennie Durr, whose German ancestors settled in this lush province in 1770, 
grows wine grapes, table grapes and peaches on a 400-acre farm that spills down 
from his front doorstep. He is a tall, quiet 52-year-old with wavy, 
sun-bleached gray hair and blue eyes. His wife, Evelynne, 47, runs an antique 
shop behind the house. Thirty mixed-race Colored farm workers live nearby in 
small homes hidden by thick shade trees. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee, her 23-year-old sister Lynne, and brothers Hennie Jr., 20, and Johan, 
18, grew up here amid the blooming pink and white chrysanthemums, spending 
vacations overseeing laborers in the hot packing shed, lounging around the 
swimming pool or diving for lobster in the Atlantic Ocean 40 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
For years, the Durrs, like most whites, were isolated from the black majority, 
relying on news reports of bombings and township violence in newspapers that 
support the government and on state-run television. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew there were some problems, but I always thought that the government 
would solve them," Leslee remembers thinking as a high school senior. "We led a 
100% white life. It was quite absurd. I never knew there was an African 
township of 100,000 people right outside of town." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's first visit to a black township came while at Stellenbosch University, 
her parents' alma mater and for decades the citadel of white Afrikaner 
education. It was early 1986, during the height of township violence, and 
Leslee joined a program to tutor black adults seeking high school diplomas. 
</P>
<P>
"I was shocked to see the discrepancies between black and white education," she 
remembers. "These people just wanted to learn, but no one had bothered to teach 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee soon was working with the Stellenbosch chapter of the radical National 
Union of South African Students (NUSAS), attending meetings at nights and on 
weekends, and she changed her major from psychology to political philosophy. 
She was attracted to the moral purity of the black liberation struggle and 
horrified by the scenes of injustice she saw in townships where few whites 
dared to go. 
</P>
<P>
On regular Sunday visits home, Leslee brought word of repression and 
police-inspired violence that was rarely mentioned by the newspapers or 
television. And over family meals, speaking their native Afrikaans, Leslee 
began sparring with her disbelieving parents. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had stand-up fights in this house over politics," said Leslee's mother, 
Evelynne. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's father said he quickly learned it was "very difficult to argue with 
young people because they are so idealistic." But he tried. 
</P>
<P>
"They weren't necessarily arguments, but discussions," he says. "At least we 
could sit down and talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
Hennie "hates fighting," his wife said. "He likes everything to be hunky-dory." 
</P>
<P>
At school, politics quickly became more important than academics for Leslee. 
She became head of NUSAS and pressured school administrators to desegregate 
campus dormitories, as other South African colleges have done. 
</P>
<P>
NUSAS planned a demonstration for mid-May, but the school rector, Mike de 
Vries, wrote two letters to warn Leslee that it would violate the campus ban on 
protest marches. During a subsequent meeting with her, De Vries offered to push 
for open residences but insisted that any attempt at campus protest would be 
dealt with severely. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee refused to back down. "You always say, 'Wait, wait, wait,' " she 
remembers telling De Vries. "But we've lost faith in you." 
</P>
<P>
On May 18, NUSAS supporters marched 50 yards from the university library to the 
administration building. A few right-wing students pelted the demonstrators 
with eggs and water balloons. 
</P>
<P>
De Vries wrote Leslee's parents to complain about her stubbornness, and he 
included security police photos of her at the rally. The letter came as no 
shock to Leslee's mother. 
</P>
<P>
Even as a young child, Leslee was "terribly obstinate," her mother said. "But 
also very brave. Fearless. She was not scared of anything." 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, Leslee was summoned to a late-night disciplinary hearing and 
expelled. The panel also banned NUSAS and a black students' organization. 
</P>
<P>
The news did not go down well at home, where the Durrs consider themselves 
"terribly law-abiding. We never even go over a white line," Evelynne said. 
Hennie Durr didn't say much. But he took a long walk in the vineyards. 
</P>
<P>
"No parent can be happy when their daughter is expelled. That's basic. It was 
in all the papers and it was an embarrassment. It's a blot on your record," 
Hennie Durr said. "You have to abide by the rules, right or wrong." 
</P>
<P>
The Durrs' phone rang with the curses of anonymous callers and unsolicited 
advice from strangers about how the Durrs might rein in that rebellious 
daughter. Although the Durrs did not agree with Leslee's politics, they were 
angered by the number of people who thought Leslee was a wild-eyed 
revolutionary trying to plant bombs in shopping centers. They knew better. 
</P>
<P>
"Strangely enough, one learns to accept" the calls and the embarrassed silence 
of friends, Leslee's mother said. "But it's time-consuming and a helluva 
nuisance." 
</P>
<P>
At one point, Evelynne recalls, she kidded her daughter, "Your life is so 
exciting and we have to face all the flak." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's expulsion triggered a wildcat strike by university cooks, maids and 
other staff, and student protests spread to other universities. Furious parents 
were on the phone to Hennie Durr, complaining that their children couldn't 
study while making their own beds and meals. 
</P>
<P>
"I sympathize, but I don't know what I can do about it," he told them. 
</P>
<P>
Under pressure, De Vries rescinded his orders and promised to retry Leslee in a 
hearing he never got around to scheduling. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee became a target for right-wing students. Rocks and bottles crashed 
through the windows of the house she shares with four other women near campus. 
And Leslee awoke one morning to find a sign across the street with an arrow 
pointing at her front door. It read: "Leslee Durr's House." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's curly brown hair and her Citroen car were soon recognized across the 
14,000-student campus and even in the townships. 
</P>
<P>
"You have to leave immediately," she said a police officer once told her before 
a rally in a mixed-race township near Stellenbosch. 
</P>
<P>
"Why?" she demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Wherever you go there is trouble," he answered. 
</P>
<P>
Then on Sept. 5, the day before South Africa's general elections, she joined 
students and faculty members in a protest march to the center of Stellenbosch, 
less than a mile from campus. Police used dogs and batons to break up the 
crowd, and 28 people, including Leslee and her sister Lynne, were arrested and 
detained for several hours. 
</P>
<P>
She called home later that night to ask about her father's mood. 
</P>
<P>
"You better not come home for a month," Leslee's mother told her. 
</P>
<P>
"Hennie never loses his temper," Evelynne Durr said. "But he thought, 'This is 
it. They've gone too far.' I mean, getting arrested in the streets. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's father decided that, beginning next semester, he'd cut off the $2,000 
a year he was giving Leslee to supplement her student loan. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll be getting a job this year," Leslee said. 
</P>
<P>
The government dismissed charges against hundreds of protesters arrested 
nationwide in September, but it brought the Stellenbosch 28 to court. After a 
weeklong trial, they were fined the equivalent of $20 each. 
</P>
<P>
"I must admit, we both admire Leslee's guts," her mother said. "And come hell 
or high water, we're her parents." 
</P>
<P>
The Durr family came together again over the holidays, bantering about politics 
over meals of venison and fresh seafood and avoiding loud debates. 
</P>
<P>
Leslee was studying for exams, and new college graduate Lynne was looking for a 
job. Hennie Jr. had just finished his military service and was ready to enter 
Stellenbosch, where he has already been warned by friends that initiation rites 
will be difficult for "Leslee Durr's brother." 
</P>
<P>
Johan, the youngest, will soon begin his mandatory one-year stint in the army, 
where being Leslee's brother may prevent him from getting a security clearance. 
Hennie Jr. remembers taking plenty of razzing from his army buddies for trying 
to defend his radical sister. 
</P>
<P>
Both brothers say Leslee has changed them. 
</P>
<P>
"She doesn't know this, but I agree with her quite a lot," Hennie Jr. said. 
"Although I still think she's a bit too radical." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee said her father has warned her not to discuss unions with the farm 
workers and he forbids her to talk to Johan about the army. 
</P>
<P>
" 'Your little brother is going in and there's nothing you can do about it,' " 
she said her father has told her. And she has agreed. "The more I influence 
him, the more difficult it's going to be for him in the army." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee's father really is not sure how far to the left his daughter stands, and 
he keeps the family peace by not asking too many questions. He said he figures 
she'll mellow in a year or two when she enters the real world. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents still think I'll get over it, get a nice job, a big car, marry a 
nice man . . . ," Leslee said. "But in South Africa, just living is a political 
statement, being white is a political statement." She wants to work for an 
anti-apartheid organization after graduation. 
</P>
<P>
"My parents are very moral people, very nice people," she said. "But we 
disagree on the fundamentals, the very basics." 
</P>
<P>
She hates to be called liberal, for instance, which she said is a "swear word 
for people who know there have to be changes in the country but want to drag it 
out as long as possible." 
</P>
<P>
Her parents probably fit that category. 
</P>
<P>
Hennie Durr said he realizes the country "has to get away from the color issue. 
People should be judged on their ability." But among Afrikaner farmers, he 
said, "what has happened on the rest of the continent is in the back of most 
guys' minds all the time." 
</P>
<P>
"I suppose we've been spoiled," said Evelynne Durr, sipping tea on her veranda. 
"And it upsets me to think we've lived a good life and our kids are not going 
to be that well off anymore." 
</P>
<P>
Leslee wrestles with that Afrikaner heritage, sometimes feeling guilty for the 
comfortable life style in which she was reared. But moving into a township is 
not the answer, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"It will only increase white fears if they see their children swept away by the 
revolution," she said. "They need to know that you can be a normal person and 
still be part of the liberation struggle."

MENDOCINO STATUE REMAINS A TIMELESS MYSTERY

<TEXT>
<P>
For more than a century at this time of year, many have wondered if the 
mysterious statue on the top of the old Masonic Hall in this quaint coastal 
town has something to do with the dawning of a new year. 
</P>
<P>
The large statue carved out of a solid block of redwood shows what appears to 
be a bearded Father Time with wings and a sickle, standing at the back of a 
maiden patiently braiding her hair. 
</P>
<P>
Standing behind a book open on a pedestal, the maiden holds an acacia branch in 
her right hand, an urn in her left hand. By her side is an hourglass and in 
front of her is a broken column. 
</P>
<P>
The tableau, it turns out, has nothing directly to do with New Year's. Rather, 
its figures are engaged in rituals known only to Masons. 
</P>
<P>
For everyone else, the scene on the roof remains the same silent enigma that it 
has been since its creation in 1872 not long after the Masonic Hall was erected 
by the 70 seafarers, loggers and ranchers who founded the lodge. The top floor 
is still the lodge headquarters. The bottom floor, since 1977, when the Masons 
sold the building, is a branch of the Savings Bank of Mendocino. 
</P>
<P>
"Hardly a day passes that someone doesn't come into the bank and ask the 
meaning of the statue," said Erich Schmid, 43, vice president and manager of 
the bank branch. "Some days several people come in and ask for an explanation. 
I tell them it means what you see." 
</P>
<P>
Schmid knows what the statue means but he won't say. He also happens to be the 
treasurer of the lodge. "It's Greek to everyone except a Mason. Some ask, 'Is 
Father Time strangling that woman?' " laughed the banker. 
</P>
<P>
Wilbur Wade, 60, retired state forest ranger and master of the lodge, says he 
cannot reveal the meaning of the mythical figures. It depicts a part of the 
confidential Masonic ritual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Fran Lewis, 65, the assistant grand secretary of the Grand Masonic Lodge of 
California in San Francisco, explains that there is a special meaning to each 
part of the statue. 
</P>
<P>
"But I can't tell you the story behind each item," he said. "All Masons know 
it. They learn the story when they take their third degree, the final step to 
becoming a Mason. The meaning of what is depicted by the statue isn't written. 
It is passed along word of mouth, one Mason to another." 
</P>
<P>
Lewis added that what he can say is that all parts of the statue together mean 
"time, patience and perseverance will accomplish all things. 
</P>
<P>
"That statue really should not be there," he said. "It should never have been 
done. Technically, according to our beliefs, it is something that should not be 
publicly displayed." 
</P>
<P>
Duane (Buck) Killion, 59, a retired CHP officer and past master of the 
Mendocino Masonic Lodge, said Masons from all over America and many foreign 
countries come to the isolated small town just to see the statue. "All Masons 
know it's here," Killion said. 
</P>
<P>
The statue was hand-carved by the lodge's first master, Erick Albertson. He was 
27 in 1865 when he started carving it in his spare time. He worked at the local 
lumber mill. He carved the statue in a cabin on the beach and worked at night 
by candlelight. It took him seven years to finish it. Shortly after he finished 
it he died. 
</P>
<P>
Albertson also carved fluted columns, arches, ceiling decorations and other 
artistic renderings inside the building, all symbolic of the Masonic order. 
</P>
<P>
The Father Time statue is the best-known landmark in Mendocino, located on a 
spectacular headland, a town of 1,000 population founded in 1852 by several 
people who migrated to California from the state of Maine.

NEW YEAR RINGS IN STIFFER DRUNK LAW

Drinkers beware. 
</P>
<P>
When the New Year begins at midnight, a tough new law will take effect making 
it all the more risky to drink and drive. 
</P>
<P>
As the 1990s begin, law enforcement officers will be armed with a new blood 
alcohol standard that will reduce the amount of alcohol one can drink before 
being presumed drunk. 
</P>
<P>
Under the new law, the existing blood alcohol standard of .10 will drop to .08. 
The difference is substantial. 
</P>
<P>
A 150-pound person could have three drinks in an hour and still register below 
the .10 mark, according to the Department of Motor Vehicles. But that same 
person would now have to limit the number of drinks to two in an hour to stay 
below the new standard. 
</P>
<P>
The California Highway Patrol warns that New Year's Eve party-goers should cut 
back on their drinking or find a way to stay away from the wheel. 
</P>
<P>
"The law takes effect at one minute after midnight and that's when we're going 
to put it into effect," said CHP Deputy Commissioner Spike Helmick. "People who 
are going to run the risk of drinking and driving had better drink less this 
year." 
</P>
<P>
Tonight, he noted, nearly every CHP officer in the state will be on duty and 
looking for drunk drivers. 
</P>
<P>
But beyond New Year's Eve, state officials hope the stricter standard will help 
persuade drinkers to change their habits permanently and avoid driving while 
intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
Helmick urged groups of drinkers to pick a designated driver who will remain 
sober. Or, he said, people who have had too much to drink should take a cab, 
call a friend or find another way home. 
</P>
<P>
California is one of only four states to adopt the restrictive .08 blood 
alcohol level standard. The others are Maine, Oregon and Utah. 
</P>
<P>
Sen. Bill Leonard (R-Big Bear), the author of the law, said medical evidence 
overwhelmingly demonstrates that people are intoxicated when their blood 
alcohol level reaches .08%. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, Leonard said, tests have shown that many individuals can be drunk at 
levels of .05 or less. Even at as low as a .02 blood alcohol level, drinking 
can interfere with a driver's judgment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The amount of alcohol that will produce a .08 level varies from person to 
person and will depend on such factors as an individual's weight and how 
recently he or she has eaten. 
</P>
<P>
But for a person who weighs between 90 and 149 pounds, three drinks consumed 
during a two-hour period is almost certain to produce a blood alcohol level of 
.08, according to the CHP. (One drink is considered 12 ounces of beer, four 
ounces of wine or 1 1/4 ounces of 80-proof liquor.) 
</P>
<P>
Similarly, for a person who weighs between 150 and 189 pounds, four drinks 
during a two-hour period will result in intoxication. 
</P>
<P>
Leonard said his goal in carrying the bill was to reduce the number of drunk 
driving fatalities, not to increase the number of people arrested for driving 
under the influence. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to see anybody arrested," he said. "I want to see people drinking 
and having fun and driving when sober." 
</P>
<P>
After years of rejecting the lower level, the Legislature agreed this year to 
adopt the .08 blood alcohol standard to reduce the number of deaths and 
fatalities on California's highways. 
</P>
<P>
More than 2,500 people died in 1988 as a result of drunk driving accidents and 
more than 65,000 others were injured. So far this year, 1,789 have died in 
drunk driving accidents. 
</P>
<P>
The CHP's Helmick estimates that 25,000 people have died in California during 
the 1980s as a result of drunk driving. During the same period, well over 3 
million people have been arrested for driving while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Helmick noted that the 1980s have seen the enactment of much 
tougher laws against drunk driving and an increasing perception that driving 
while intoxicated is socially unacceptable. Tougher penalties include a 
mandatory jail term and loss of driver's license for the first offense and 
fines that can reach $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
Even tougher laws have been passed by the Legislature and will take effect in 
the coming years. In 1992, truck drivers will be subject to a strict blood 
alcohol standard of .04. 
</P>
<P>
And beginning in July, 1990, law enforcement officers will be authorized to 
immediately confiscate the driver's license of anyone found to be driving under 
the influence. "We're going to start taking away the licenses when the 
handcuffs go on," Helmick said. 
</P>
<P>
CHP Commissioner Maury Hannigan said the adoption of the .08 standard for 
motorists is a recognition of the fact that drivers are affected after 
consuming smaller amounts of alcohol than the state has acknowledged in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
"Most people are impaired to the point where it diminishes their driving skills 
and judgment after just two drinks in one hour," Hannigan said. "People who 
drive after drinking are a threat to themselves and others on the road even if 
they only drank what we previously thought was a small amount." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
DRUNK DRIVING LAW 
</P>
<P>
 This chart shows the percentage of alcohol in the blood, for various weight 
levels, after one hour from the time the first drink was consumed. One drink is 
defined as a 12 ounce beer, a 4 ounce glass of wine or a 1 1/4 ounce shot of 80 
proof liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law that takes effect Jan. 1, a driver with .08% or higher is 
presumed to be drunk; however, those with lower levels could also be cited for 
drunk driving.

LEGISLATORS' CHALLENGE: KEEP COMPROMISES COMING

SACRAMENTO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State lawmakers made big news in 1989 by doing their jobs. On Wednesday, they 
return to the capital to see if they can make it a trend. 
</P>
<P>
After years of stalemate, the governor, lawmakers and private-interest groups 
last year hammered out compromises aimed at relieving highway gridlock, ending 
a garbage crisis and rescuing a troubled program that compensates workers who 
are injured on the job. 
</P>
<P>
But that progress did not wipe the slate clean. 
</P>
<P>
Auto insurance premiums continue to climb. More state residents lack health 
insurance than ever before. Earthquake-ravaged Northern Californians are crying 
out for added help. The $2-billion failure of an Irvine-based savings and loan 
has raised questions about the state's oversight of that industry. And the 
courts hold the fate of property tax-cutting Proposition 13 in their hands. 
</P>
<P>
Beyond that, various legislative leaders are set to propose ambitious new 
programs involving drug abuse, children's services and growth management. 
</P>
<P>
All this comes at a time when members of the Legislature may be more 
preoccupied than usual by a unique set of distractions. 
</P>
<P>
As 1990 begins, one state senator is on trial for corruption while federal 
agents continue to investigate several of his colleagues. Two-term Gov. George 
Deukmejian, who plans to quit politics at the end of this year, is a lame duck, 
and the candidates to succeed him will be trying to chart the state's course 
independently of the Legislature's desires. Abortion rights advocates and their 
foes are drawing political lines in the sand. And several initiatives heading 
for the ballot strike at the heart of the way lawmakers conduct the people's 
business. 
</P>
<P>
One final wild card is the state budget, which Deukmejian will unveil Jan. 10. 
The Republican governor's advisers are already warning that the budget for the 
1990-91 fiscal year, though larger than the current year's spending plan, will 
not be big enough to please everyone. And a major confrontation may be looming 
over health and welfare costs, which the governor's top aide said are growing 
so fast that state spending cannot possibly keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Frost, Deukmejian's chief of staff, said welfare caseloads are climbing 
at twice the rate of population growth, and other health and social service 
costs are increasing by 15% to 20% a year. He said the state has little choice 
but to end annual cost-of-living increases for welfare recipients and may have 
to cut benefits and tighten eligibility rules as well. 
</P>
<P>
But if history is any indication, the governor's budget proposals in this area 
will quickly draw flak from Democrats and, most likely, drain away much of the 
good will still remaining from 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"We will probably be civil to each other until some time in April," predicted 
Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento). "That's not a lot of time." 
</P>
<P>
With such a small window of opportunity and a long agenda, lawmakers and the 
governor are expected to narrow the list of major issues on which they will 
concentrate. 
</P>
<P>
Health insurance seems likely to be at or near the top of that short list. 
</P>
<P>
The Legislature passed and the governor signed last year a bill by Assembly 
Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) calling for a study to find the best way 
of providing affordable insurance to the estimated 5 million Californians who 
lack even minimum coverage against illness or accident. 
</P>
<P>
Deukmejian responded by appointing a high-level task force of legislators, 
doctors, insurance executives and consumer and labor activists. The 
unprecedented group has been meeting since November in search of a consensus, 
which could form the starting point for legislative debate and action. 
</P>
<P>
"The governor's task force has brought together people who for years have been 
bitter enemies on this issue and put them in one room," said Assemblyman Burt 
Margolin (D-Los Angeles). "It's been a serious process. It's bearing fruit. 
People are proposing ideas and concepts and negotiating to produce a law in a 
way that previously hadn't seemed possible." 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers -- particularly Assembly Speaker Brown -- also will be focusing on 
automobile insurance this year. Brown intends to follow up on a bill he 
authored last year to provide low-cost auto policies to low-income good 
drivers. The bill was vetoed by Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
Brown's measure conflicts with another by Assemblyman Patrick Johnston 
(D-Stockton). Johnston's bill would create a system under which motorists' own 
insurance companies would pay their claims without regard to who caused the 
accident. That no-fault approach, which is the law in New York and several 
other states, enjoys broader Republican support but repeatedly has been bottled 
up in the Assembly by Democrats loyal to Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti (D-Los Angeles) also opposes the 
no-fault system, which has been bitterly fought by the Democratic leadership's 
allies in the trial lawyer lobby. But Roberti said his opposition is "not 
fixed." 
</P>
<P>
"I am fixed in trying to be pragmatic, in trying to come up with what will 
reduce automobile rates," Roberti said. "I still clearly lean against no-fault. 
But, in an attempt to bring about compromise, I think we have to abandon fixed 
ideological positions." 
</P>
<P>
Some other issues that will be getting attention in the second year of the 
1989-90 session: 
</P>
<P>
* Earthquake relief. Lawmakers, meeting in special session in November, passed 
a temporary, quarter-cent sales tax increase to raise $800 million for 
earthquake-stricken Northern California. But many local officials contend that 
the bail-out will fall short. Among the increased aid to be considered will be 
a proposal to give added grants to cities and counties to make up for sales tax 
revenue lost because business activity decreased in quake-damaged downtown 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
* Family planning and abortion. Deukmejian's decision to cut two-thirds of the 
state budget for contraceptive and women's health services is being challenged 
in the courts. Meanwhile, legislative leaders and the Administration are 
negotiating in search of a way to restore much of the money in a way that 
conservatives can be assured will not benefit abortion clinics. 
</P>
<P>
Seeking to turn public opinion their way after several well-publicized 
electoral defeats, anti-abortion groups are reportedly set to propose two 
measures that could put abortion rights groups on the spot. One measure would 
outlaw abortions sought because the parents are not happy with the sex of the 
fetus. The other would make it easier to file criminal charges against someone 
who injured a pregnant woman and caused the death of her fetus, a concept known 
as "fetal manslaughter." 
</P>
<P>
* Savings and loan regulation. The failure of state-chartered Lincoln Savings 
&amp; Loan has prompted lawmakers to question whether California regulators are 
doing enough to protect the savings of state residents. Senate and Assembly 
committees have been hearing testimony on the issue during the legislative 
recess, and a number of proposals are expected to be introduced when lawmakers 
return. 
</P>
<P>
Then there is the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
An election year is usually enough by itself to keep the Legislature from 
enacting major programs. But this year also involves two special elections to 
replace legislators who have moved to other positions, the election of a new 
governor and, likely, the consideration of a couple of dozen ballot measures, 
several of which involve the Legislature itself. 
</P>
<P>
Already virtually assured of places on the ballot are two initiatives that 
would change the way the state draws new political districts each decade, a 
process known as "reapportionment." Another pending measure, one of three 
pushed by Atty. Gen. John K. Van de Kamp as part of his gubernatorial campaign, 
would limit members of the Legislature to 12 consecutive years in either the 
Assembly or Senate. 
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers, meanwhile, must also confront problems still lingering from their 
approval last year of two constitutional amendments scheduled to appear on the 
June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
One proposal, which addresses legislative ethics, would ban honorariums for 
state officeholders, require the Legislature to meet in public and prohibit 
lawmakers from lobbying the Legislature for a year after they leave office. The 
proposal also would establish a commission to set salaries for legislators, 
allowing them to obtain a pay raise without having to vote on it. 
</P>
<P>
The problem is that the constitutional amendment sets several broad guidelines 
which are to be implemented by statutes passed by the Legislature. But 
lawmakers were unable to agree on the wording of those bills last year. If the 
proposed laws are not passed before the measure goes on the ballot, the voters 
will be asked to approve a likely pay raise without any guarantee that 
legislators' outside incomes will be limited. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if it is going to have any credibility at all, the Legislature has got 
to go on record in favor of tough enforcement and tough standards," said 
Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar). "Otherwise, it just looks like a wish and 
a prayer and trust-me-on-this-one kind of thing. And the voters are not going 
to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
The other proposed constitutional amendment would alter the state's spending 
limit and trigger a doubling of the gasoline tax, which would raise $18 billion 
for a 10-year highway and transit construction program. But the deal, 
considered one of the key accomplishments of 1989, is endangered by opposition 
from the building industry and a hostile stance taken by the California 
Teachers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
"If the gas tax goes down, the summer is going to be spent figuring out what in 
the hell we do, because we will have no money for roads," Assemblyman Katz 
said. "A major crisis becomes a severe crisis at that point. That will be a 
real nightmare."

PANAMA CITY 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A cartoon in a local newspaper Saturday, portrayed Manuel A. Noriega as a 
vulture hovering menacingly over this capital city. Another publication 
recounted allegations of his heavy involvement in drugs, graft and torture. 
</P>
<P>
"The narco-trafficker Manuel Noriega is not deserving of political asylum and 
is a common criminal," La Estrella de Panama, long the country's largest 
newspaper, quoted Noriega critics as charging. 
</P>
<P>
No one ever said the ousted Panamanian dictator was a prince, but it's been a 
long time since anyone around here dared print such a notion. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the dramatic turnabouts in Panama in recent days, one of the more 
astounding involves the Spanish-language media. 
</P>
<P>
A press that, up to two weeks ago, willingly groveled before Noriega and 
viciously condemned the United States -- one paper even accused President Bush 
of threatening to freeze the assets of Panamanian boxer Roberto Duran unless he 
threw last month's championship fight that he lost to Sugar Ray Leonard -- has 
suddenly joined the chorus calling for Noriega's head and is wildly applauding 
the American invasion. 
</P>
<P>
"Now they are putting in the truth, but before they were publishing only the 
lies of Noriega," smirked taxi driver Alipio Falconet as he thumbed through the 
latest copy of La Estrella. 
</P>
<P>
After a few days' hiatus at the height of the fighting, newspapers have begun 
to hit the streets with full details of American military sweeps and attempts 
by political outsiders, once sneered at in the press, to rebuild the shattered 
government. Two privately owned television channels are back on the air -- 
another two run by Noriega and his military are still dark -- and over and over 
again highlight the same pictures seen by American news audiences of the 
besieged Vatican embassy where Noriega has taken refuge. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, radio stations quickly dusted off some politically tinged oldies 
that the Noriega regime had religated to a hit parade of banned music. One of 
the most requested tunes has been "Disappearances," a Ruben Blades ballad about 
repressive regimes and the victims they murder. It was banned here in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega's ouster has triggered the biggest upheaval in the Panamanian media in 
more than two decades. The new U.S.-backed administration of President 
Guillermo Endara has already announced that three government-run "scandal 
sheets" will be returned to their original owners. 
</P>
<P>
More significantly, the editors of La Prensa, a highly respected opposition 
newspaper often ordered closed by Noriega, have announced that it will hit the 
newsstands again sometime before the end of January. One hitch: Sometime since 
the last shutdown in February, 1988, vandals, thought to be Noriega loyalists, 
sabotaged much of the paper's composing and word-processing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Under Noriega and his mentor, the late military strongman Omar Torrijos, the 
Panamanian press has led a checkered existence. As is the case in many Third 
World countries, publications and broadcast stations have traditionally been 
viewed as mouthpieces for one political faction or another. Still, frequent 
government crackdowns on press freedom have been punctuated by occasional thaws 
during which conflicting views were tolerated in print and on the air. 
</P>
<P>
As relations with Washington soured after Noriega's 1988 indictment on U.S. 
drug-trafficking charges, he tightened the leash on his country's press for 
good. La Prensa was closed indefinitely, the government papers turned 
increasingly strident and La Estrella, historically pro-American and 
anti-Communist, joined the chorus of anti-Washington criticism. 
</P>
<P>
The government television stations were easy to control, of course. So was the 
cable television system, owned by Noriega himself, which featured pirated 
American programming and often distorted the sound and picture when news came 
on. The government also sometimes jammed the audio portion of news broadcasts 
on a television station beamed from U.S. military installations here. 
</P>
<P>
Clearly, the most interesting media conversion in post-Noriega Panama involves 
La Estrella, one of Latin America's oldest newspapers. Begun as the 
English-language Star in 1853, it is controlled these days by the wealthy and 
politically influential Duque clan, a family torn by enough internal strife and 
bickering to rival the Ewings of "Dallas." 
</P>
<P>
The president and publisher of La Estrella is Tomas Altamirano Duque, known 
better by the nickname Fito. In addition to his publishing empire, he was a 
prominent member of Noriega's political party, serving four terms in the 
legislature, and was tabbed before the invasion by Noriega as his choice to 
head the Panama Canal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
Also sitting on the paper's board of directors is Carlos Ozores Typaidos. Until 
the invasion, Ozores served as the vice president of Noriega's handpicked 
government. 
</P>
<P>
Despite those connections, Duque insisted that he had not been a Noriega crony 
and had only bowed to the strongman's will to save the paper from the same fate 
as La Prensa. In 1987, Duque said, Noriega came to him in person and warned 
bluntly, "Consider yourself censored." He did, Duque admitted, imposing 
voluntary restrictions on his publication. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think we have a credibility problem," Duque said of his paper's 
new-found anti-Noriega voice. "When Noriega was in what could you do? Nothing. 
The U.S. created Noriega and they couldn't do anything to stop him for a long 
time. How do they expect us to do something?" 
</P>
<P>
Duque insisted that he did more of a public service by remaining open and 
throwing an occasional bone to Noriega's critics than standing on principle and 
being shut down. 
</P>
<P>
Critics, including some in his own family and business, dismissed such 
suggestions as self-serving nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Duque, the general manager of La Estrella, who has waged a bitter 
political, personal and financial feud with his cousin Tomas, said readers will 
have a hard time believing that the paper's flip-flop is genuine. "We're going 
to have weak credibility," he argued. 
</P>
<P>
He said he already has been notified by an advertising industry trade group 
that members plan to stop placing ads in the paper unless Tomas Duque and 
Ozores resign. Alejandro Duque said he plans to demand that family members who 
hold stock in the company purge the two men before their continued presence 
does significant damage to the paper.

The Soviet Union demanded again Saturday that the United States withdraw its 
invasion troops from Panama immediately. 
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry called in U.S. Ambassador Jack F. Matlock and expressed 
displeasure with the American military intervention, the official Soviet news 
agency Tass said. 
</P>
<P>
Moscow insisted on an American withdrawal when U.S. troops invaded Panama on 
Dec. 20 seeking to arrest dictator Manuel A. Noriega and bring him back to the 
United States for trial on drug-trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
The ousted Panamanian strongman eluded capture and entered the Vatican's 
embassy Dec. 24. 
</P>
<P>
Tass said First Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh called on U.S. 
forces to pull out of the Central American country. 
</P>
<P>
"It was again declared that the interests of normalization and stabilization of 
the situation in the Central American region demand the immediate withdrawal of 
American forces from Panama," Tass said.

Soft-pedaling its diplomatic differences with the United States, the Vatican 
said Saturday that it does not intend to help deposed dictator Manuel A. 
Noriega evade justice by granting him refuge in its embassy in Panama City. 
</P>
<P>
A communique from the Vatican's Secretariat of State one day after the Vatican 
criticized harassment by U.S. troops surrounding the embassy was a clear 
peace-seeking gesture, in the judgment of Vatican observers. 
</P>
<P>
In the first public comment from the Vatican secretariat overseeing 
negotiations, Saturday's statement said that "close contacts" continue with the 
United States "in a spirit of serene collaboration" to find a "just and 
mutually acceptable solution" to what it called a complex case. 
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Vatican, sensitive to complaints from Roman Catholics for having 
sheltered Noriega in the first place, warned the United States against 
"interference" with its diplomatic rights. 
</P>
<P>
By the standards of a traditional, close-mouthed foreign ministry which 
observes strict protocol and measures policy by decades, badgering an embassy 
with loud music and frisking its personnel, as U.S. troops have done, is 
boorish and counterproductive, one Vatican analyst said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the apparent lack of movement reflected in Saturday's 
statement suggested to observers that the Vatican foresees no end to the 
impasse before the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
Noriega, whose military government was toppled by a Dec. 20 American invasion, 
entered the Vatican nunciature one week ago today in flight from U.S. troops 
seeking to arrest him to face drug trafficking charges in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
"The apostolic nuncio had no intention of obstructing the course of justice 
regarding a person who is accused of grave crimes," the secretariat's statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Admitted to the embassy in what the Vatican calls a correct decision of the 
papal nuncio, Archbishop Jose Sebastian Laboa, Noriega has remained 
incommunicado there while the diplomatic tempest rages around him. 
</P>
<P>
International conventions subscribed to by Latin American republics as well as 
the United States and the Vatican provide the right of political asylum but 
offer no protection to common criminals. 
</P>
<P>
The Vatican said Friday that no decision had been taken on Noriega's request 
for political asylum. Instead, he has "temporary political refuge" at the 
nunciature but is being encouraged to leave. 
</P>
<P>
The former strongman will not be forced to go, however, the Vatican says. 
Neither, Vatican diplomats insist, is there any legal way that a diplomatic 
mission accredited to Panama can turn him over directly to the United States, 
which the Vatican regards juridically as "an occupying power." 
</P>
<P>
Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro would not elaborate on the brief secretariat 
statement Saturday but indicated that the Vatican had still not received a 
letter written earlier this week in which Guillermo Endara, Panama's new 
president, asked that Noriega be expelled from his sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout a tense week of negotiations, the Vatican has hinted repeatedly that 
it would look favorably on a formal request from Panama for Noriega to face 
criminal charges there. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts here conclude that Endara sees nothing to gain for Panama by relieving 
the Vatican of a hot potato. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, for its part, says that Panamanian stability cannot be 
assured while Noriega remains in the country. There has been no attempt by the 
Holy See to locate a third country willing to accept Noriega, the Vatican has 
said repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
Once again Saturday the Vatican defended Laboa's acceptance of Noriega's 
request for shelter, saying he acted "to help end a conflict which in the 
previous days had provoked great destruction and many victims." 
</P>
<P>
L'Osservatore Romano, the Vatican's official newspaper, made no mention 
Saturday of the diplomatic standoff with the United States. Instead, it 
published statements from three Panamanian bishops, and from Cardinal John J. 
O'Connor of New York, hailing Laboa's action in what O'Connor called 
"effectively neutralizing Noriega and his violent stand."

Angry crowds forced Communist Party chiefs and officials to flee the 
Azerbaijani city of Dzhalilabad on Friday after police shot and killed a 
teen-ager and wounded 150 other people at a protest rally, local journalists 
said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"The power is in the hands of the people. The party, the police and local 
government officials have no power whatsoever," said journalist Nazim Ragimov, 
speaking from Baku, capital of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
Police opened fire Friday morning on thousands of demonstrators gathered in the 
center of Dzhalilabad to demand curbs on the power of local party officials, 
said Nadzhaf Nadzhafov, editor of the radical Azerbaijani Popular Front. 
</P>
<P>
He said the crowd then overwhelmed the police, forcing them to drop their guns 
and flee. Demonstrators later attacked the Interior Ministry building. 
</P>
<P>
Party and local officials also reportedly fled the city of about 20,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
The official Azerbaijan Baku Radio later said the situation in Dzhalilabad was 
stable but tense. It said 37 people were detained and 63 members of the militia 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
It quoted the republic's health minister as saying 22 people were treated as a 
result of the disturbances and that six of them were still hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
Bakinsky Rabochy, the Communist Party daily in Baku, 150 miles east of 
Dzhalilabad, said the protest was "an abuse of glasnost (openness) and 
democracy." 
</P>
<P>
The Soviet republic, which borders on Iran, has been a hotbed of Islamic 
fundamentalism mixed with Azerbaijani nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
The official Tass news agency gave few details of the clash, saying only that 
"an extremist group" attacked Communist Party headquarters and the offices of 
the Interior Ministry. It said the situation had "stabilized" but did not 
mention any casualties. 
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry is responsible for the secret police. 
</P>
<P>
The news agency said a session of the Azerbaijani Supreme Soviet (Parliament) 
meeting in Baku was adjourned because of the disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
Bakinsky Rabochy said an investigation has been launched into the incident. 
</P>
<P>
The bloodshed was the latest sign of popular discontent sweeping the Soviet 
Union and Eastern Europe in a challenge to old-style Communist rule. 
</P>
<P>
Nationalist and ethnic tensions on the Soviet southern flank have already 
endangered President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's drive for political and economic 
reforms. 
</P>
<P>
The turmoil in Dzhalilabad marked a turn in events in Azerbaijan, where most 
grass-roots activism has been aimed at neighboring rival Armenia for nearly two 
years in a dispute over who controls the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. 
</P>
<P>
The unrest around the Soviet periphery -- from the Baltic republics' stubborn 
drive for autonomy to the explosive Transcaucasus -- shows signs of sparking a 
backlash of Russian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
Ten hard-line nationalist groups rejected Gorbachev's reform policies Saturday 
and demanded that Moscow end crippling subsidies to the outlying ethnic 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
In a joint election platform issued ahead of next March's poll in the Russian 
Federation, the biggest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics, the 10 called for 
Russian representation in the other republics to protect the rights of ethnic 
Russians. 
</P>
<P>
"They think concessions are being made to separatists and different kinds of 
left-radicals who are ready to break up the Soviet Union and sell our national 
treasures to Western partners," the conservative newspaper Soviet Russia said. 
</P>
<P>
The resurgence of Russian nationalism, coupled with an appeal to traditional 
Communist values, could prove attractive to voters frustrated by the failure of 
Gorbachev's reforms to revive flagging living standards. 
</P>
<P>
The key issue in Dzhalilabad was apparently the unbridled power of local party 
secretaries, the journalists said. 
</P>
<P>
"The situation is complicated in many regions of the republic. It is 
reminiscent of Romania," where a popular rebellion overthrew the bloody 
dictatorship of Nicolae Ceausescu, said Nadzhafov, speaking from Baku. 
</P>
<P>
The new movement in Dzhalilabad is headed by a local doctor, Mir-Ali Bakhramov, 
the journalists said. The protests began Thursday night, when thousands of 
residents poured into a city square in front of party headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
Police moved in with guns drawn early Friday and opened fire, killing a 
19-year-old demonstrator and wounding 150 others. The crowd then turned on them 
and forced them to flee.

ISRAELI POLICE ATTACK PEACE MARCH;

Unprovoked police attacks marred an otherwise peaceful rally of Palestinians, 
Israelis and Europeans who joined hands Saturday in the biggest demonstration 
of the two-year-old Arab uprising. 
</P>
<P>
Police used rubber bullets, tear gas and truncheons to break up crowds that had 
gathered outside the historic Old City of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
At least 50 participants were reported to be hospitalized with mostly light 
wounds and welts and another 50 were arrested, police said. All but 16 
Palestinians were released by nightfall, a spokesman said. Two thousand 
municipal and border police were on hand for the rally. 
</P>
<P>
An Italian woman in the Pilgrims Palace Hotel suffered severe damage to an eye 
when green dye sprayed from a police water cannon burst windows along the upper 
floors and sent shards flying inside. In another incident, police overshot 
their mark with tear gas canisters and gassed a unit of their comrades. 
</P>
<P>
The tumult took place in Arab-populated East Jerusalem near the Damascus Gate, 
one of the main entrances to the walled enclave that encompasses shrines of the 
Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths. 
</P>
<P>
Police also raided the National Palace Hotel in East Jerusalem and sprayed tear 
gas into a packed lobby where Palestinian leader Faisal Husseini was preparing 
to give a post-demonstration press conference. 
</P>
<P>
"Today, even with a permit to hold a demonstration, you can see that the police 
used brutality," said Husseini, who is associated with the mainstream Fatah 
wing of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 
</P>
<P>
"We, the Palestinian people, have the same experience every day," he said. "But 
today, we are not alone." 
</P>
<P>
Despite the short outbursts of violence, most rally-goers, which included women 
and children, stood calmly, held hands and, at one preplanned moment, launched 
colored balloons aloft in the unseasonably clear skies. Pacifist anthems such 
as "We Shall Overcome" and "Give Peace a Chance" blared from loudspeakers near 
Jaffa Road, Jerusalem's main commercial street. 
</P>
<P>
The goal of completely encircling the Old City with a human chain was foiled as 
large groups collected near main intersections and city gates. Crowds on the 
side of the city facing the Mount of Olives were sparser. 
</P>
<P>
No one unfurled Palestinian flags or threw stones, both of which commonly 
incite police to crack down. Police said they attacked demonstrators because 
they were shouting "nationalist slogans," government radio reported. 
</P>
<P>
Some youthful demonstrators shouted "Long live Abu Amar!" the Arabic nom de 
guerre of PLO chief Yasser Arafat, but most people settled on shouting "We want 
peace!" in a variety of languages. 
</P>
<P>
The rally was organized by European peace groups, the Israeli Peace Now 
movement and Palestinian activists and was meant to show support for 
negotiations to end the Arab uprising on the basis of giving the Palestinians 
an independent state alongside Israel. 
</P>
<P>
"There are Israelis joining hands with Palestinians, and this means 
compromise," said Galia Golan, an organizer from Peace Now. Golan said that the 
estimated crowd of about 20,000 was larger than expected, given the police 
blockade set up to intercept participants from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. At 
least a third of the crowd was made up of Israeli Jews. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders said that the rally heralded "a new phase" of protest and 
suggested that there may be more such demonstrations in tandem with Israeli 
peace groups. "Joint activity is a way of showing that on both sides, there is 
a demand for a just solution," said Hanna Siniora, editor of Al Fajr, a 
newspaper in East Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
The government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir lashed out at the 
demonstrators, and there were calls from members of his Likud Party to prohibit 
such events in the future. Pinhas Goldstein, a member of Likud, called the 
Israeli and European demonstrators "tools of Israel's enemies," government 
radio said. 
</P>
<P>
Teddy Kollek, the longtime mayor of Jerusalem, criticized foreign 
participation. "I have my doubts about guests who visit for an hour, create a 
disturbance and leave us to cope with the damage to years of efforts to foster 
coexistence," he said on the eve of the rally. 
</P>
<P>
Peaceful mass rallies have been rare during the past 18 months of the intifada, 
as the uprising is known. Rallies are forbidden for Palestinians, and police 
routinely break up crowds with tear gas and rubber bullets. Only the umbrella 
of European and Israeli participation made Saturday's rally possible, Arab 
organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
Several Israelis present were shocked by the police action. Menahem Bluzer and 
his wife, Yorit, both Israeli citizens from Rehovot, were bruised in the head 
by rubber bullets. 
</P>
<P>
"We were standing alone. The crowd had already run off. A policeman saw us 
clearly. He took aim and fired right at us," said Menahem Bluzer, who wore a 
bandage around his head. His wife showed a large welt on her forehead. 
</P>
<P>
"I am ashamed. I am not pleased to tell this story. The police -- our police -- 
shot at us without reason," Bluzer said. 
</P>
<P>
The demonstration followed weeks of negotiations among the Europeans, 
Palestinians and Israelis to agree on a common theme. Some hard-line 
Palestinian activists opposed joining hands with Israelis while Arabs are being 
shot down in the street and imprisoned by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
In a brief speech at the northwest corner of the Old City, Husseini evidently 
sought to balance the line between militancy and showing empathy for Israelis. 
"We must respect our people who have been killed and who are in jail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"We also have respect for Israelis who are in jail for opposing the 
occupation," he added, in reference to about 100 Israeli soldiers who have 
served short prison sentences for refusing to do military duty in the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
Palestinian citizens in general welcomed the participation of foreigners, but 
its effect on Israelis, who have grown mistrustful of a critical outside world, 
is harder to gauge. Even Israeli peace activists were wondering about not 
having staged the rally themselves. 
</P>
<P>
"There is a certain discomfort about having foreigners participate. After all, 
this is our struggle, the Israelis and Palestinians," said Sidra Ezrahi, an 
Israeli peace activist. 
</P>
<P>
The Europeans included about 900 from Italy and smaller groups from Britain, 
West Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and the Scandinavian countries, as 
well as a small number of Palestinian-Americans.

Federal authorities Saturday said they were investigating a threat made against 
a federal judge, but said there was no indication the case was related to 
recent bombings that killed an Alabama federal judge and a Savannah, Ga., city 
councilman. 
</P>
<P>
An FBI spokesman declined to discuss the nature of the threat against U.S. 
District Judge Lawrence P. Zatkoff, who has been presiding over a case 
involving a key figure in a Detroit police corruption scandal. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, who declined to give his name, would say only that the threat 
was received by the Detroit Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the threat was related to recent bombings in the South, the FBI 
spokesman said: "There is no indication that they are connected." 
</P>
<P>
A Maryland circuit court judge was injured Dec. 22 in the explosion of a bomb 
mailed to his home. A U.S. appeals court judge was killed Dec. 16 in a bomb 
explosion at his suburban Birmingham, Ala., home. Two days later, a Savannah 
city councilman and lawyer active in civil rights was killed by a bomb blast at 
his office.

Investigators sifted through the charred rubble surrounding a Bronx power plant 
Saturday, trying to reconstruct events leading up to a massive gas explosion 
that killed two people and injured scores of others. 
</P>
<P>
Consolidated Edison sent a team of experts to its Hellgate power facility, 
where more than 100 utility repairmen were working to fix five electricity 
feeders damaged in the spectacular Friday afternoon blast. 
</P>
<P>
The thunderous explosion, apparently touched off when a Con Ed worker backed a 
backhoe into an exposed gas line, sent bright orange flames surrounded by 
plumes of thick black smoke hundreds of feet into the air. 
</P>
<P>
The monstrous blaze forced the utility to shut off electric service for 
hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers on Friday, paralyzing subway service for 
evening rush hour commuters. 
</P>
<P>
Electric service was restored, but customers on the Upper East Side of 
Manhattan were asked to limit usage to prevent an overload on the system. 
</P>
<P>
Utility investigators were trying to determine the exact cause of the explosion 
and whether the utility's construction crew was aware of the gas line, said 
Laurie Hanson, a Con Ed spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
It was unclear whether government officials would take part in the 
investigation. Con Ed comes under the purview of the state's Public Service 
Commission. A spokesman for the commission was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
The fire damaged the Hellgate facility itself, destroyed a nearby recycling 
plant, demolished at least 20 cars and forced police to evacuate residents from 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of firefighters battled the five-alarm blaze, which abated somewhat 
after Con Ed shut off the gas line feeding the fire about an hour after the 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
The operator of the backhoe, Louis Seminario, 58, of Queens, was declared dead 
at the scene, officials said. One other unidentified person, a teen-ager who 
apparently was a bystander, was pulled from the East River and later died from 
a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
More than 30 firefighters and eight others suffered injuries in the explosion 
and fire, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Authorities ordered police in the Bronx, Manhattan and Queens to work overtime 
to prevent looting and vandalism, but no incidents were reported, officials 
said.

A Coast Guard cutter reached a sinking Greek freighter 800 miles

abandoning ship yet. They're still trying," Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer

the 620-foot M.V. Bulka of Kingston, St. Vincent, which was on its way to South 
Korea from Los Angeles with a cargo of scrap metal, to help with the pumps that 
the vessel has been using to try to pump water out of its cargo hold.

A bar-based sports bookmaking ring in Santa Barbara County that may have 
handled $200,000 a week in bets was broken up with the arrests of at least six 
people, authorities said Saturday. A team of state and local officers raided 
three bars and several other businesses and residences in Santa Barbara, 
Carpenteria and Santa Maria as well as Rocklin, near Sacramento. The raids 
concluded a six-week investigation led by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's 
Department. The raids came after undercover officers made a series of large 
cash bets at the bars and traced the movement of money to other locations.

More than 120 guests were temporarily evacuated from Yosemite Lodge because 
park rangers feared that high winds might topple trees onto the building. The 
guests were allowed to return to their rooms after the winds quieted Friday 
afternoon and a National Park Service crew cut down two trees that were 
considered potential dangers. There was no damage to any units, said Dan Jensen 
of Yosemite Park and Curry Co., which manages the lodge.

The runways at Alameda Naval Air Station are mostly go these days, 2 1/2 months 
after the big earthquake virtually grounded routine air operations at the base. 
One of the two runways damaged by the Oct. 17 quake has been repaired and the 
base has resumed normal air operations, according to a base spokesman. "For all 
intents and purposes, we can have anything take off and land," said spokesman 
Bill Valente. "We're operational."

A night of bloodshed that left two dead and four wounded made 1989 a record 
year for homicides in Oakland and restored the city to its former place among 
the deadliest towns in the nation, police said. The killing that pushed Oakland 
past the previous record occurred Thursday night at a Chevron gas station where 
an unemployed Vietnam veteran earning change by pumping self-service gas was 
beaten and shot, said Oakland Police Lt. Michael Sims. The deaths brought the 
number killed this year to 148, two more than the 1986 record, Sims said. With 
a holiday weekend left before the year's end and one victim clinging to life, 
the number is likely to rise before the counting stops, he said. Oakland's 
homicide rate of 41.5 killings per 100,000 was higher than New York City or Los 
Angeles and placed the city of 356,300 in a league with New Orleans, Detroit 
and Washington.

RANDY LEWIS: DO CULTURAL IMPRESARIOS TAKE REQUESTS? PLEASE STOP SELLING 
AUDIENCES SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
In reflecting over Calendar's recent coverage about where Orange County arts 
has been in the '80s and where it's headed in the '90s, I'll join my colleagues 
who are offering wish lists for the decade ahead (see Page 45A) and put in my 
fantasy request: In the final decade of the century, I would wish for a new 
maturity among those responsible for our arts and entertainment offerings. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s, for so many local organizations, was the decade of birth, and with 
birth came the natural wonder of the new. I count myself among those who may 
have taken in their first top-flight ballet production -- others may have 
witnessed their first major-orchestra concert, big-league art show, serious 
theater production or big-time rock 'n' roll show. 
</P>
<P>
It was the decade we were inundated not just with so-called world-class talent, 
but with celebrities: Michael Jackson, Mikhail Baryshnikov, David Hockney, Sam 
Shepard, Rudolf Nureyev, Madonna, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Lloyd Webber, Luciano 
Pavarotti, Leontyne Price, Johnny Cash. 
</P>
<P>
But along with the marveling at the unfamiliar, which in the infant's eyes 
constitutes the entire world, we suffered through the awkwardnesses, the 
embarrassments, the temper tantrums and the pettiness that comes hand-in-hand 
with youth. 
</P>
<P>
Sometimes the ticket-buying public went along for the ride when artistic 
decisions were made solely on the basis of star appeal or, worse, on an 
assumption that we wouldn't know the difference between a superstar, a has-been 
or a never-was. 
</P>
<P>
We had seen Pavarotti on "The Tonight Show," so we applauded rapturously 
through his scant 30 minutes on stage during a big-bucks fund-raiser for Opera 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
We flocked by the thousands to anything and everything touched by Andrew Lloyd 
Webber, the cause celebre of cultural tastemakers at People magazine, yet we 
came only by the dozens on some nights to a production as inventive and 
imaginative as South Coast Repertory's "Hard Times." 
</P>
<P>
We rushed for tickets to "Elvis: A Musical Celebration," which shamelessly 
mimicked the life of the King of Rock 'n' Roll at the 3,000-seat Performing 
Arts Center, but left half the chairs empty in the 400-seat Coach House for a 
great modern-day rocker like Joe Ely. 
</P>
<P>
Those deficiencies, however, will be rectified with a bit of time and 
experience. The more an audience experiences, the more discriminating it 
becomes. 
</P>
<P>
But that equation is dependent, in large part, to the quality of that which we 
have the opportunity to experience. 
</P>
<P>
What we don't need in the '90s is operas with flashy sets designed to elicit 
oohs and aahs from first time opera-goers, while the stage is filled with 
second-rate singers who draw boos and bahs from seasoned veterans. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need tired musicals that trot out as their stars big names from 
theater past, or of TV sitcom fame or former game-show hosts. 
</P>
<P>
We don't need more reunions of mediocre '60s rock groups that bump young, vital 
performers out of the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
And we unequivocally don't need breathy press releases hyping the biggest, most 
expensive, most elaborate, most mind-boggling production the world has ever 
seen. How about just giving us our money's worth, and leave it at that? 
</P>
<P>
Now that the new-car smell is fading from our cultural edifices of the '80s, 
it's time for our cultural impresarios to take a few more giant leaps toward 
adulthood. 
</P>
<P>
My request: Don't sell audiences short. And don't always sell them merely what 
you know they will buy. The lowest-common-denominator ethic of mainstream 
television should provide a sobering lesson. For years, network television 
shows charted millions of viewers, and bigwigs blithely ignored the cries of 
those who found the quality continually declining. 
</P>
<P>
But that was while the networks had the only game in town, proof, perhaps, that 
people will watch what is on. With the latter-day explosion of home video, 
networks' combined audience share has been steadily declining. The answer is 
simple: choice. With a captive audience, quality is a non-essential. But when a 
real choice is offered (not the pseudo-choice between "Geraldo" and "Oprah"), 
most people will reject the inferior. 
</P>
<P>
And lest anyone forget, our cultural organizations are not only competing with 
each other for audience share, they are also competing with television, the 
movies, home video, the Rams, the Angels, Disneyland and the plethora of 
leisure-time activities available to those of us privileged to live in the 
temperature-controlled Promised Land. 
</P>
<P>
And just think of the grandest fringe benefit of all behind this approach: 
those pesky critics will be deprived of so much ammunition for their obligatory 
year-end cheap shots. 
</P>
<P>
Happy New Decade.

TREASURE OF INDIAN ARTIFACTS TRIGGERS OWNERSHIP BATTLE; 
</P>
<P>
ARCHEOLOGY: PALOMAR COLLEGE FILES SUIT SEEKING RETURN OF THE ARTIFACTS FROM 
TEACHER WHO SAYS THEY BELONG TO LANDOWNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
An argument over broken bits of bone, shell, pottery and stone has escalated 
into accusations of grand theft and a civil lawsuit between an archeologist and 
one of the colleges where she teaches. 
</P>
<P>
The debris, left behind by ancestors of the Luiseno Indians, is priceless to 
Leslie Quintero, an archeologist and instructor at Palomar Community College 
and San Diego State University. From the debris, she is reconstructing the life 
style of an Indian culture that lived in the area at least 600 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
To Palomar College, these thousands of pieces of ancient leftovers are worth 
$100,000. That's the price the college put on the material when college 
officials filed a complaint with the county Sheriff's Department earlier this 
month alleging Quintero took the artifacts from college property and refused to 
return them. In legal language, that adds up to a felony: grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero readily admits that she removed the artifacts from a Palomar College 
lab during the Thanksgiving holidays and concedes that the artifacts do not 
belong to her. But, she adds, neither do they belong to Palomar College. 
</P>
<P>
The midden -- or refuse heap -- into which Quintero has been probing since 1981 
is on land owned by Donald Sullins of Vista, she explained. Sullins owns what 
was found on his property, Quintero claims, and Sullins gave her permission to 
remove the Indian artifacts and to use them in her research. 
</P>
<P>
"I was very surprised when Dr. (George) Boggs called me and demanded that I 
return the artifacts to the college," Quintero said. "I have never heard of any 
case in which an educational institution has acted in this way." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs, president of Palomar, said that he, too, was surprised. He said that he 
could not understand why Quintero, a teacher at the San Marcos junior college 
since 1981, would remove college property. He said that the instructor had been 
given permission to use the materials from the dig in her research but had not 
been told she could remove them from the campus. 
</P>
<P>
"I have tried to talk to her in recent days and have been unable to," Boggs 
said. "We feel that we must protect the public funds used on the dig and must 
recover the artifacts. Their value to us is in the teaching field and for 
research. We can't place a value on that." 
</P>
<P>
Boggs said that the $100,000 value placed on the collection included about 
$56,000 in salary paid to Quintero as a part-time instructor, the cost of 
cleaning, marking and cataloguing the artifacts, and the expense of determining 
the age of the materials. 
</P>
<P>
After an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a court order forcing Quintero to 
return the collection, Palomar College attorneys filed a civil suit against the 
archeologist and landowner Sullins to recover the materials. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero shakes her head at the legal maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a very curious situation," she said. California has very specific 
regulations on personal property rights, she said, all placing ownership of 
artifacts with the landowner. 
</P>
<P>
Sullins could not be reached for comment but his wife confirmed that he had 
given Quintero permission to conduct the dig on his property. Sullins hopes to 
build a museum for the artifacts on his property after Quintero finishes her 
research, his wife said. As for the archeologist, she is far from finished with 
her work at the site. 
</P>
<P>
The painstaking collection of bits and pieces has so far shown her that the 
tribe led a well-ordered life, using the dig site as their winter quarters, 
making autumn forays to Palomar Mountain to harvest acorns -- a staple food in 
their diet -- and spending the summers at the beach. 
</P>
<P>
Their seafood diet included not only mollusks, probably gathered at Carlsbad's 
Agua Hedionda Lagoon, but also deep-sea fish like skipjack and tuna, Quintero 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Chips of obsidian found in the midden indicate that the early-day Indians also 
engaged in trading. She has traced the chips to sources near the Salton Sea and 
to the Coso Mountains near the Owens Valley. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero said she never signed agreements with the college concerning the 
artifacts because they are not hers to give. She said she had planned to take 
the collection to San Diego State, where more sophisticated equipment is 
available to continue her research. But, she said, Palomar officials blocked 
that move by speaking to SDSU officials. 
</P>
<P>
The dig has gone slowly, she said, because the midden does not yield its clues 
in neat layers. Ground squirrels, burrowing into the ancient trash heap, have 
scrambled the artifacts, making it more difficult to unravel clues about this 
early San Luis Rey-area tribe. 
</P>
<P>
With time-dating, which Quintero says was paid for by funds she solicited, and 
with a special technique she has developed to determine the season the animals 
were killed from rings in their teeth, she is piecing together the lives of 
these early ancestors of the Luiseno Indians. 
</P>
<P>
Quintero said she is determined to finish her research, despite the college's 
decision not to renew her teaching contract for the coming semester. She said 
she will miss the Palomar students who aided her at the dig while she taught 
them fine points of archeological sleuthing. 
</P>
<P>
"At first I arranged meetings with school officials" over the artifacts, 
Quintero said, "but the school agreed to meet only if I brought the artifacts 
back. I suggested that we meet in a neutral place but they gave me an 
ultimatum," to return the Indian materials or face the consequences, she said. 
</P>
<P>
Gene Jackson, dean of Palomar's humanities division, said that the hostilities 
that have escalated between the college and Quintero "is a sad thing." He said 
that the school has had plans for a museum to house such artifacts on the 
drawing board for years. 
</P>
<P>
"There should be a common ground here," Jackson said, "and this should be 
worked out somehow. The artifacts belong here, near where they were found."

SAN DIEGO LOOKS GOOD, FROM L.A.; 
</P>
<P>
LIFE STYLE: A FORMER SAN DIEGAN TELLS WHAT HE MISSES ABOUT THE CITY, AND A FEW 
SURPRISINGLY PLEASANT THINGS HE HAS FOUND IN LOS ANGELES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD KIPLING, Richard Kipling was city editor of The Times' San Diego 
County Edition from 1984 until July of this year, and before that he was an 
editor at the San Diego Union. He is now assistant hiring editor for The Times 
in Los Angeles. He grew up in Kansas. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On a typical winter morning in the foothill suburbs north of Los Angeles, the 
air is mountain-crisp and clear as I start my drive to work. Descending into 
downtown, whizzing past Glendale, Eagle Rock, Echo Park, the smog appears -- 
first out there, then gradually enveloping the landscape, my commute, my 
workday. 
</P>
<P>
No more kidding myself. This isn't haze or coastal fog; no more promises of San 
Diego burn-off by noon. It's S-M-O-G. 
</P>
<P>
It has been more than five months since I left San Diego; five months of living 
in this sprawling megalopolis I had spent almost 25 years in Southern 
California avoiding. 
</P>
<P>
After nine years of living and working and surveying San Diego as a newspaper 
editor, moving away -- especially to dreaded Los Angeles -- has brought out in 
bold relief what I like and miss about San Diego, what hold it has over me. 
</P>
<P>
I've found that, while some of the things I miss are predictable, others are 
more curious, unexpected. And I've found a few things that I don't miss, and a 
few positive surprises in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Here's a catalogue: 
</P>
<P>
* Water. I expected the ocean to remain a part of my life when I moved here. 
Wrong, how wrong, and how I miss San Diego's water-closeness. 
</P>
<P>
From the moment you enter San Diego County on Interstate 5, water becomes a 
major part of the landscape. Past San Onofre, Pendleton, then the coastal 
communities and right into downtown San Diego, water beckons. 
</P>
<P>
And the city itself? San Diego Bay, Mission Bay, the Pacific -- the city is 
built around water. The downtown crawls right to its edge, on two sides. Many 
of the neighborhoods have wonderful views of it. San Diego and water are not 
separate entities; there is no San Diego without water. 
</P>
<P>
Now, conjure up L.A. -- workaday L.A., not the public-relations version. It is 
emphatically not a water city. The downtown is almost 20 miles from the water; 
it might as well be Phoenix with higher buildings. No L.A. freeway offers a 
surfside view. Except for the utterly unaffordable far Westside, most of the 
neighborhoods -- even many wealthy ones -- are 30, 40 minutes from the water, 
and sans ocean view. No, San Diego wins the water derby hands down. 
</P>
<P>
* Downtown. This one surprised me. I expected downtown Los Angeles to be an 
"L.A. Law" kind of place -- vibrant, high-energy, filled with cafes, 
restaurants and shops vying to attract downtown workers like me. Instead, I 
found a disjointed, spread-out downtown, broken up by freeways and fast-traffic 
streets and inconvenient, uncultivated hills. 
</P>
<P>
Until I arrived in Los Angeles, I took San Diego's convenient, coming-alive 
downtown for granted. Now I recognize its charms: the short blocks that bring 
all of downtown within easy walking reach; the burgeoning cafe/restaurant 
scene; the outdoor food carts and proliferating coffee bars; the bayside open 
space, views of water and breezes that cool the downtown air. I would never 
have guessed this a few months ago, but I'll take San Diego's downtown over 
L.A.'s any time. 
</P>
<P>
* Traffic. No surprise here. Take the height of morning rush-hour traffic 
heading into San Diego from North County, multiply by three and then watch it 
stay at that level all day long. That's Los Angeles. Some nights I leave work 
at 8 and there are still tie-ups on the major freeways. The logjam has gotten 
so bad that, on surface streets, drivers routinely run the first seconds of red 
traffic lights. No one expects to be cited, and they aren't. Los Angelization? 
Hey, San Diego's not in the same league -- yet. 
</P>
<P>
* Pace. Life in San Diego is less frenetic than it is for the average workaday 
Angeleno. So much time is spent getting to and from anywhere here in the Basin 
that there's little time left to do anything. And the crush of people at the 
places you do go makes any expedition daunting. By comparison, San Diego is a 
marvel of accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
* Smog. I never considered the psychological impact of the stuff. It's a prime 
cause of grouchiness, edginess, depression. So not only do I wheeze and cough 
and rub my eyes, but I yell at my wife, my car and my computer. You can get 
used to it, I suppose, but at what cost? Maybe San Diegans won't have to get 
used to it. At least that's what you want to believe. 
</P>
<P>
Now to the things that I haven't missed, and a few things about Los Angeles 
that I've been pleasantly surprised by. 
</P>
<P>
* Boosterism. In five months here, I've yet to hear a city official talk about 
how L.A. is really No. 1, or try to persuade its citizens to vote for spending 
X to build Y because a "world-class" city needs one. No, L.A. seems to go about 
its booming business without reducing its elected officials to hucksters. 
</P>
<P>
It seems to me it's time San Diego did the same, and stopped using the 
self-congratulatory civic rhetoric: "America's Finest." Let the beauty and 
amenities of the nation's sixth-largest city speak for themselves, and get its 
elected officials to spend their time on its problems, not its P.R. 
</P>
<P>
* Foliage. I'm shocked when I visit San Diego these days at how denuded it 
appears in comparison to Los Angeles. In most of the L.A. metropolitan area 
that I frequent, there are wonderful, mature shade trees as well as Southern 
California's trademark palms. The foliage not only offers relief from sun and 
heat, but also lends a sense of tradition, of permanence to the communities 
that have cared for them. 
</P>
<P>
In San Diego, by contrast, most every community has palms, a few other 
light-limbed species, and very little else. Drive through North Park or 
Kensington or Normal Heights or Clairemont or San Carlos or even Mission Hills 
and Point Loma and you see more sky than tree. Perhaps San Diegans don't like 
trees and love open sky. But when I compare the two, Los Angeles simply comes 
off as more lovely, more gracious, more permanent. 
</P>
<P>
* Development. Whether it is threatening views along the downtown bayfront, 
slicing away mountains or plowing under flower fields, development in San Diego 
is becoming ugly. Each time I make the drive down I-5 toward San Diego, I see 
hillsides being mowed down, houses going up just off the lagoons; formerly 
wonderful, green vistas increasingly are being replaced by views of rooftops. 
</P>
<P>
Curiously, I find it even uglier now than I did as a San Diegan, perhaps 
because I now know what it will look like in five years; perhaps because now I 
expect San Diego to be my respite from the relentless sprawl of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego still offers that wonderful, physical sense of freedom or freshness 
or openness. Whatever it is, I don't think I'm the only one to experience it 
when I dash south across the Orange County line. But that feeling is 
diminishing because of the pressures of growth and the inability of the various 
governmental structures to control it. No one who has lived in San Diego, left 
it and returned can fail to be shocked by the way growth has changed the 
feeling of the area. 
</P>
<P>
I haven't been quite fair to L.A. in all this. People here are friendly. We 
identify with neighborhoods instead of the whole. Most of us Angelenos don't 
spend time in the glitz of Beverly Hills or on Rodeo Drive; it's as foreign to 
us as it is to most San Diegans. We survive the sprawl by settling for activity 
pockets -- areas nearby that offer recreation, food, drink and cultural and 
entertainment possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
Plus, we have relatively easy access to those wonderful things that San Diegans 
and others flock to L.A. for -- its wide variety of big-time sports, music, 
stage, shopping and, yes, glitz. 
</P>
<P>
Still, the quality of life in Los Angeles does not equal life's quality in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
But when I drive south down I-5, I find myself wondering about San Diego's 
future, and all the yelling about Los Angelization. I think that when San 
Diego's freeways really get crowded; when smog becomes truly intolerable; when 
no one can point to an open field or a mountain without a flattop -- well, 
don't blame Los Angeles. Seems to me, San Diegans will have done that to 
themselves.

NEW DECADE IS WHEN BILLS WILL COME DUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As many observers have noted, the 1980s were the decade when San Diego emerged 
as a major urban center, with a full range of big-city problems. But dealing 
with those problems was significantly hampered by tight government budgets 
brought about by Proposition 13 and cutbacks in federal programs during the 
Reagan Administration. So the 1990s are the decade when many bills will come 
due. 
</P>
<P>
Some have already started being paid. 
</P>
<P>
Developers are paying for many more services, such as roads, schools and parks, 
that were once paid for by the taxpayer. Those fees, in large measure, are 
passed on to home buyers. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans also voted to increase the sales tax from 6% to 7% during the 1980s 
to improve roads and public transportation and jails and courts, although the 
latter increase is tied up in court. 
</P>
<P>
But more big-ticket items are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
In the early part of 1990, the San Diego City Council will work out the final 
details of the Housing Trust Fund it approved this month. As it stands, $54 
million a year in new taxes and fees would be dedicated to building and 
subsidizing affordable housing for poor and working-class people making $18,700 
a year or less for a family of four. The Housing Commission estimates that 
individuals would contribute up to $44 a year in fees to the fund, with the 
rest coming from commercial-development fees and taxes on businesses and hotel 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
The affordability of housing is a problem that will have to be addressed 
throughout the county if employers are to continue attracting workers, and the 
city's Housing Trust Fund is a good way to start. 
</P>
<P>
But the amount and types of user fees and taxes that local government wants to 
levy require more debate because, also in early 1990, the council will be 
considering how to raise money for more than $1.5 billion in other public 
needs, such as more police, parks, road improvements and a new library. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, some council members who are attempting to get the trust fund 
reconsidered are using rhetoric that will only whip up an anti-tax, 
anti-government sentiment that might undermine the whole public-financing 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
San Diegans heard much about water and sewers in the '80s and started paying 
higher rates to renovate an aged and neglected sewer system. In the 1990s and 
the early part of the next century, as San Diego moves to water reclamation and 
upgrades its sewage treatment to meet federal standards, sewer and water bills 
will continue to rise. One report estimates that monthly bills will go up 
another $15 to $20 through 1995. 
</P>
<P>
One observer quipped that the nearly $3 billion that the system is expected to 
cost over the next 15 to 20 years is a lot of money "just to flush the toilet." 
But he forgets that most of that money will go for water reclamation. Since San 
Diego imports 90% of its water, and is at the end of Southern California's 
water pipeline, the investment is well worth it. 
</P>
<P>
Health and social services are also woefully under-funded. Prenatal care and 
drug-abuse treatment are just two areas desperately in need of funds. And in 
both cases, a dollar spent helps prevent other social and health problems. 
</P>
<P>
The county has sued the state because it receives less money per capita for 
some health services than almost any other county in California. A resolution 
of that suit in the 1990s would greatly improve health and social services 
here, without having to add more local taxes. 
</P>
<P>
A lawsuit filed in San Diego this year (involving a La Jolla property) 
challenges the constitutionality of Proposition 13 and could, of course, 
eventually change the public-finance picture. But many of these problems and 
financial needs won't wait. 
</P>
<P>
Elected officials here, as elsewhere, have tried to stay clear of taxes, 
knowing that none of us wants to pay more. 
</P>
<P>
But San Diego, and the state, cannot afford to put off paying the bills any 
longer. The welfare of the whole community requires that these problems be 
addressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
The revelry of New Year's Eve is expected tonight as Orange Countians usher in 
the new decade. Along with the annual fun and festivities invariably comes 
those who try to drive home drunk. 
</P>
<P>
To that end the California Highway Patrol has stepped up its enforcement 
efforts. Local officials say 75% of the department's available manpower will be 
on the road tonight. Drunk drivers will have one more obstacle come midnight, 
as a new state law takes effect that lowers the legal blood alcohol limit from 
0.10 to 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
Those too drunk to drive may call (800) 422-4143 from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. nightly 
tonight and Monday to get a free cab ride from any public place to their home. 
The free rides are limited to a 20-mile radius with riders picking up the cost 
for additional miles. The service is co-sponsored by Mothers Against Drunk 
Driving and CareUnit Hospital of Orange. 
</P>
<P>
Also offering free rides home are Yellow Cab of North Orange County and Orange 
Coast Yellow Cab under a program sponsored by local beer and wine wholesalers.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: IT'S AN IDEA THAT CAME STRAIGHT OFF THE TRASH HEAP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

"This project," declared Kathryn Kellogg, "was born of my personal hate of 
seeing trees in a dumpster and seeing a tree lot the day after Christmas with 
all those leftover trees that will go to a landfill. It just made me sick." 
</P>
<P>
Kellogg has reason for such displeasure. After all, she's a Kellogg -- a member 
of the family that, for 65 years, has manufactured fertilizer and soil 
amendments. As corporate secretary of Carson-based Kellogg Supply Inc., it's in 
Kellogg's interest to look for new sources of business. 
</P>
<P>
And these days, she's looking at Christmas trees. Carson Christmas trees, to be 
precise. 
</P>
<P>
Under a new program developed in conjunction with city officials and Western 
Waste, which picks up residential trash in Carson, Kellogg Supply will recycle 
the city's trees into compost. Western Waste has agreed to pick up the trees -- 
which must be free of metal stands, tinsel, ornaments and flocking -- at the 
side of curbs Jan. 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
Carson Mayor Mike Mitoma said the program "marks Carson as a leader in the 
recycling effort in California." 
</P>
<P>
The composting program is similar to one already used in Santa Monica, also 
involving Kellogg Supply. But it is unlike most municipal Christmas tree 
recycling programs, in which trees are ground into chips that are used as fuel 
for boiler plants. 
</P>
<P>
According to Kellogg, the Carson program will take the recycling one step 
further -- full circle, so to speak -- by converting the trees into a product 
that is "very comparable to rich Midwest topsoil." It can then be used to help 
new plants grow. 
</P>
<P>
The compost will not, however, nourish other Christmas trees. Kellogg says her 
company's products are for the most part used in home gardens, on shrubs, 
lawns, rose bushes and azaleas. 
</P>
<P>
Those who do not live in Carson but want to put their old Christmas tree to 
good use can take the tree to one of seven Los Angeles recycling collection 
sites. In the South Bay, trees will be collected every day except New Year's 
Day from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Harbor Regional Park, Vermont Avenue and Pacific 
Coast Highway in Harbor City. The program ends Jan. 6. Sheryl Stolberg

SOUTH BAY DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN STABBED TO DEATH IN GANG FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One man was stabbed to death and one was seriously injured early Saturday when 
members of two rival gangs clashed outside a Gardena apartment house, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Eight suspected gang members have been jailed on suspicion of murder and 
attempted murder following the 1 a.m. incident at 15015 S. Normandie Ave., Sgt. 
Hernandes Lobo said. No bail has been set for the men. 
</P>
<P>
Police could not release identification of either victim until their families 
were notified, Lobo said. The dead man, a Los Angeles resident believe to be 
about 20 years old, had been stabbed in the neck during the fight and died at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
The injured man, a 21-year-old Los Angeles resident, had several stab wounds on 
his torso and was listed in critical condition at the same hospital. 
</P>
<P>
Lobo said both gangs involved are based in Los Angeles. Members had come to 
Gardena for a party. 
</P>
<P>
Two Gardena officers were first on the scene after spotting 30 or 40 people 
fighting in the street during a routine cruise through the neighborhood, Lobo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to several Gardena police units, officers from the Hawthorne Police 
Department and Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies were called to help 
control the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
The stabbing suspects are brothers Dasrrel Hilt, 18, Tony Hilt, 20, and Varley 
Hilt, 22, believed to be residents of Los Angeles; Compton resident Johnny 
Graham, 21,; Los Angeles resident John Williams, 26; and Albert Jones, 23, 
James Mitchell, 20, and Nathaniel Hawkins, age unknown.

MISSING OCEANSIDE GIRL BELIEVED SEEN AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORA ZAMICHOW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the Oceanside house of missing 7-year-old Leticia Hernandez, the Christmas 
presents remain wrapped and the family will not celebrate the new year. 
</P>
<P>
"We will keep praying that Leticia comes back," said the girl's uncle Javier. 
For the family of 11 crammed into a 2-bedroom house, Leticia's Dec. 16 
disappearance has stripped the holiday season of joy. 
</P>
<P>
But police delivered some good news to the otherwise bleak home in the 1300 
block of Bush Street when they confirmed a second sighting of the girl. 
</P>
<P>
A child matching the description of Leticia was seen at 11 a.m. Wednesday by 
several witnesses on Interstate 10 at the San Simon rest stop in Arizona, just 
west of New Mexico, Oceanside Police Department Sgt. Bill Krunglevich said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The girl was seen with a man and a woman at the rest stop, Krunglevich said. 
Witnesses told police that the child seemed distraught, scared and intimidated 
but she bore no visible scars or marks of physical abuse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"At least we're getting closer," said Javier, a 24-year-old convenience store 
clerk. "At least we know somebody has seen her and we know she is still alive." 
</P>
<P>
The girl was also wearing a pink-and-white-striped sweat shirt, which she did 
not have on when she disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
The second sighting has given new leads to the police, who believe the girl is 
traveling with a man and a woman. Authorities had been unaware of a woman until 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
"We are not sure whether she has been traveling with him (the man) the whole 
time," said Officer Jane Simons. 
</P>
<P>
The woman is described as being in her mid-thirties, white, 5-foot-10 with a 
slender build and bleached-blond collar-length hair, Krunglevich said. Her 
traveling companion is a white, 5-foot-8, 230-pound man with a receding 
forehead. He is reportedly clean shaven, in his thirties with shoulder-length 
thinning blond hair and a tattoo of a cross on the back of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
The child and the two adults were seen in a dirty maroon car with a tan 
interior that police believe may be a 1975 Buick Skylark. The car had yellow 
license plates with black letters, which could be from Alaska, Wisconsin, New 
Mexico or California, Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
A witness reported seeing the girl at the Buckman Springs rest stop on 
Interstate 8 the day she disappeared, but did not report it to police until 
five days later. This second sighting, reported within 24 hours of happening, 
is very encouraging for police, who are working with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to find the girl, Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
"We're real dependent on sightings and public cooperation," Krunglevich said. 
</P>
<P>
Heartened by the two sightings, police are sending two officers to help Arizona 
authorities with the case, Krunglevich said. After asking newspapers and 
television stations in the Southwest to publicize the disappearance, police 
have received 200 phone calls with tips in the last two days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
At Leticia's home, her family anxiously waits and prays. The first grader, who 
speaks Spanish and English, weighs about 70 pounds, has long brown hair, is 
missing her two front teeth and has a birthmark on her upper left leg. 
</P>
<P>
Her 9-year-old brother Victor said he doesn't mind not opening gifts on 
Christmas because he is waiting for the biggest and best present: Leticia. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about Leticia Hernandez is asked to call the police or 
966-4911.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: YEARLY VIGIL BEGINS AS WHALES PASS LOCAL WATERS ON 
6,000-MILE MIGRATION. 
</P>

<P>
The Christmas season, the old year and the decade may be winding down, but last 
week marked a traditional beginning for California's favorite cetacean, the 
Pacific gray whale. 
</P>
<P>
The day after Christmas was the official debut of the whale-watching season, 
according to officials at the Cabrillo Marine Museum and the Los Angeles 
chapter of the American Cetacean Society, which co-sponsor whale-watching 
cruises. 
</P>
<P>
As if on cue, local whale-watching companies say they have spotted a few of the 
magnificent mammals this week off the coast of the Palos Verdes Peninsula, near 
Portuguese Bend as well as near Point Vicente. 
</P>
<P>
"I saw two (Wednesday) and they put on a good show," said Capt. Jim Peterson of 
L.A. Harbor Sportfishing. 
</P>
<P>
The lone whales appeared to be front-runners, or pregnant females who typically 
lead the way on the 6,000-mile trek from the frigid Bering Sea to the warm 
waters of Baja California in Mexico, where birth and mating take place. 
</P>
<P>
Members of the American Cetacean Society, who keep a dawn-to-dusk 
whale-counting vigil from the Point Vicente Interpretive Center during 
migrating season, have counted 28 Pacific gray whales since Nov. 30, said 
center director Nancy Rosenthal. Last year, volunteers at the center's census 
point counted 2,415 whales going by from November through early May. 
</P>
<P>
The number of Pacific gray whales, which 20 years ago were declared an 
endangered species, has grown to about 21,000, said Tia Collins of the society. 
</P>
<P>
But some longtime whale watchers say the number of the mammals migrating close 
to the California coastline has declined. Although the whales are still using 
the same general path, they may have altered their course farther westward, 
whale watchers theorize, seeking to avoid injury in the boat-crowded San Pedro 
Channel. Cetacean society officials and some whale-watching boat captains say 
the gray whales may be migrating instead in the Outer Santa Barbara Passage, on 
the far side of Santa Catalina Island. 
</P>
<P>
Last week, Curt Kinkead, a Cabrillo Marine Museum volunteer who narrates 
whale-watching tours for Catalina Cruises, set out for Catalina by kayak to 
look for the mammals. 
</P>
<P>
Although fog and rough swells kept Kinkead and his partner, Phillip Hahn, close 
to the mainland and they did not see any whales, Kinkead said it is early in 
the season. To test the theory that the whales are moving farther out, Kinkead 
said he plans to row out to the Santa Barbara Passage once a week by kayak 
looking for Pacific grays. 
</P>
<P>
Kinkead -- who said he holds the world record for a canoe trip of more than 
8,000 miles -- touts the kayak as a better way to approach the mammals, who he 
said have readily approached kayaks in the Baja peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
He cautioned that kayakers should carefully follow federal guidelines for 
behavior around whales, including maintaining a distance of 100 yards from the 
mammals, not making sudden moves or dangling oars or other items near the 
animal, and keeping behind the animal rather than crossing in front of it. 
</P>
<P>
Citing the increase in kayaking as a sport and the popularity of whale 
watching, Kinkead called the two pastimes perfect complements. 
</P>
<P>
As more people kayak, he predicted, "close encounters between whales and people 
are going to become increasingly common." The smaller, motorless boats should 
make the encounters safe ones, he said -- provided kayakers follow the 
whale-watching rules. Adrianne Goodman

<P>
Our readers wrote letters throughout 1989 expressing their viewpoints on a 
variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We 
appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to 
hearing from more of them in 1990.

<P>
Not quite dawn. The smell of wet clothes, sound of coughing, mumbling, snoring. 
I felt embarrassed, like an intruder, and found myself talking in whispers and 
walking softly. After all, it is their bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
The Fullerton Armory was an eerie, cavernous hall, full of "the homeless" -- 
restless, sleeping forms sprawled on narrow, foldaway cots such as one takes to 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
At 6 a.m., the people were awakened. Many had jobs they must get to. They had 
to fold their blankets and put away their beds before breakfast. The people 
were sweet, gentle and smiled at us and said, "Thank you." It was a 
soul-stirring experience. It was mindful to some of Depression days.

During 1989, many Orange County residents wrote about their thoughts and 
feelings in commentary pieces for Orange County opinion pages. As the year 
comes to a close, we look back on some of those thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that those who use Coast Highway have a glorious view of the 
Pacific Ocean for a three-mile stretch along the Irvine Coast. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that the public now has access to the beaches that hug the 
bluffs that line the water's edge. 
</P>
<P>
It is no accident that when development takes place on the inland side of the 
Irvine down-coast property, wildlife habitats will be protected, the watershed 
will remain, the effects of traffic and air pollution will be minimized, and 
both the public and the landowner will benefit. 
</P>
<P>
The legacy of the Coastal Act is not easy to assess. It is as much measured in 
the development you don't see as in the quality of development you do see. It 
is as much measured in the views and public access you enjoy as in the citizen 
participation that made the views and access possible. 
</P>
<P>
It is as much measured in changed attitudes about protecting the environment as 
in seeing how public-private partnerships have been forged to protect coastal 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
As we anticipate the reaction that will come when the hotels, roads and houses 
begin to sprout along the Irvine coast, we should remind ourselves of what 
might have been!

An elderly woman who apparently slipped off a La Jolla cliff, plunging 80 feet 
to her death, has been identified as Elizabeth A. Verplanck, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Verplanck, 82, of the 7800 block of Torrey Lane of La Jolla, tumbled off the 
rain-slicked path at the 1500 block of Coast Walk Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
Verplanck, who carried no identification and was wearing jogging clothes, had 
been out for a stroll. Her body was found in a tide pool by three passers-by at 
3:45 p.m.

RUSTY KENNEDY ON CRIMES AGAINST GAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rusty Kennedy 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During 1989, many Orange County residents wrote about their thoughts and 
feelings in commentary pieces for Orange County opinion pages. As the year 
comes to a close, we look back on some of those thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
Name-calling, tire-slashing, thrown objects and violent physical assaults are a 
regular part of weekend nights in Orange County near gay and lesbian social 
centers, as bigoted criminals prey on people assumed to be gay. 
</P>
<P>
This hate and extreme vituperation are products of deep-rooted prejudice in our 
society. People project their fears on people who are different. The message of 
these anti-gay efforts is clear. It says some people are not hearing from their 
parents, clergy or teachers that attacking people who are different is illegal, 
immoral and intolerable. 
</P>
<P>
They are not hearing that gay men and lesbian woman are contributing members of 
our society. They are not hearing that gays are brothers and sisters and that 
they have mothers and fathers. 
</P>
<P>
If it becomes acceptable in our society to consider gays less than full 
citizens with less than full human rights, who will be the next target? What 
unpopular group will be set upon next to eliminate from our midst? Gays and 
lesbians are not asking us to join their ranks, only that we allow them to live 
their lives without fear of persecution.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN ONOFRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An unidentified man, believed to be an undocumented immigrant, was struck by 
several vehicles and killed Friday night at 8:10 as he tried to cross 
Interstate 5 near the San Onofre border checkpoint, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The man, in his late twenties or early thirties, was the last in a group to 
have crossed the highway heading east, said San Diego Deputy Coroner Cal Vine. 
He was struck by several vehicles and all the drivers involved in the incident 
stopped; none have been charged, California Highway Patrol officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim was 5-foot tall, weighed 100 pounds and had black hair, brown eyes 
and a neatly trimmed mustache. 
</P>
<P>
None of the other pedestrians in his group stopped, Vine said.

'HAZARDOUS LOTTERY' AT SUPERIOR COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Our readers wrote letters throughout 1989 expressing their viewpoints on a 
variety of issues. Here are condensed versions of some of those letters. We 
appreciate their taking the time to share their viewpoints and look forward to 
hearing from more of them in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Allow me to suggest a powerful deterrent to would-be violators of the law in 
Orange County. Let them spend one day -- just one -- in the Jury Assembly Room 
and/or the jury box of the Superior Court of the County of Orange. The problem, 
as I see it, lies not at the bench, nor with the attorneys, but with the 
hazardous lottery know as "a jury of our peers." 
</P>
<P>
I arrived at the Superior Courthouse, naive as a college freshman, eager to 
perform my jury service in the most thoughtful, unbiased manner possible. What 
I encountered was a room filled with prospective jurors who know that they, 
too, will perhaps spend interminable hours waiting to be called. Do they bring 
books or magazines? Correspondence or projects to be completed? Crosswords 
puzzles even? No. Instead, multiples of the citizenry assembled are content to 
sit for hours, staring witlessly into the middle distance. There is clearly 
nobody home. 
</P>
<P>
Then, if one is fortunate enough to be selected as a potential juror, it is 
still tough to make the final cut. Possession of an operable brain, all (well, 
most) of one's faculties, quickly renders a candidate suspect. With keen 
insight, I soon discerned that these qualities, along with basic honesty, were 
deemed unnecessary in some jury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
Judgment by a jury of my peers? I quail at the thought.

SAN DIEGO COUNTY DIGEST: SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A 24-year-old San Diego man drove his car onto the sidewalk and hit a San Diego 
Police officer and another man after the officer had told him to leave a bar 
early Saturday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego resident Hugo A. Santaella is currently in custody, charged with 
attempted murder in connection with the incident. 
</P>
<P>
Vice officers Larry Gordon and John Minto went to the Coo Coo Club in the 4300 
block of University Avenue on a routine check for underage drinkers, said San 
Diego Police Sgt. Jake Hughes. As the bar was closing, the officers asked 
Santaella to leave. The young man left the bar, then drove his car on the 
sidewalk at 1:48 a.m., Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
Minto jumped out of the way but Gordon and a bar patron, Ben Quros, were 
struck. Both men were taken to Mercy Hospital where they are listed in stable 
condition. Gordon, 37, suffered a concussion, according to hospital officials.

SEN. ALAN CRANSTON'S STOPOVER AT ADAMS ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Your front page article on Sen. Alan Cranston's visit (Dec. 16) failed to cover 
a very important part of his day in Orange County. His first stop was John 
Adams Elementary School in Santa Ana to talk about the homeless crisis with 300 
fourth- and fifth-grade students. 
</P>
<P>
He came to personally respond to letters they wrote to him as part of a 
curriculum on housing amd homelessness. Many of the students who wrote to 
Cranston were homeless or had someone in their family who had experienced 
homelessness. 
</P>
<P>
There were no protesters, so perhaps that's why you did not cover it. Compared 
to his 45-minute tour of Laguna Canyon and his forum at Century High School for 
40 people, most of them protesters, Sen. Cranston's hour spent at John Adams 
Elementary School seems pretty newsworthy to me.

ADDICT'S REUNION WITH HER CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Getting It Together" (Dec.24) was a wonderful story of a mother's victory over 
cocaine addiction and subsequent reuniting with two children. 
</P>
<P>
However, one item bothered me. And it bothers me in most coverage of the drug 
problem. I refer to the mention of the mother's "$700-a-day crack cocaine 
habit." That comes to almost $5,000 a week, more $20,000 a month and more than 
a quarter of a million dollars a year. Just for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
Where does a heavy-set, semiskilled mother of two come up with that kind of 
money? Is it an inheritance, a typographical error or are we being subjected to 
exaggerations reminiscent of Vietnam War body counts? 
</P>
<P>
My questioning of the "War on Drugs" concerns the end users: Exactly who are 
they and where do they get all the money? So far the pieces aren't fitting 
together.

HOW TO TREAT -- AND NOT TREAT -- YOUR DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Re Dianne Klein's column "If You Really Love Your Dog, You'll Treat It Like 
One" (Dec. 12): 
</P>
<P>
I find the contents extremely disturbing. It would appear that the columnist 
interviewed Sandra Ackerman (who admits to being a self-taught behaviorist), 
who reportedly made some pronouncements pertaining to the treatment of 
companion animals, specifically dogs, that unwittingly encourage 
miscommunication and consequent mistreatment of many pets. 
</P>
<P>
Dogs must have the social interaction and affection of their owners. Depriving 
them of touch, petting, stroking and other emotional support is cruel, 
inappropriate and counterproductive. It is also dangerous because, 
unfortunately, too many owners will accept Ackerman's advice as carte blanche 
to keep their companion animals in the back yard. The result of such emotional 
and physical deprivation is too frequently a variety of behavior problems. 
</P>
<P>
Of course, dogs should be treated as dogs! This does not mean that they should 
not be loved -- and shown that love. One cannot spoil a living being with love, 
only permissiveness. 
</P>
<P>
When I battle, on a daily basis, the outmoded attitudes that "it's just a dumb 
beast who needs only food and shelter" and similar other archaic and 
misinformed ideas, and I resolve serious behavior and problems by showing love 
and affection with educated methods, then such a column is out of place and 
adds to the already-disastrous condition of companion animals.

SAN JUAN'S PARKING FEES FOR AMTRAK RIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
From the commuter's point of view, I must state that this proposed parking fee 
is a poor choice on the part of the city of San Juan Capistrano. The city has 
built a parking building to relieve the parking woes of the downtown area. This 
is all well and good, except we find out that we are expected to park in the 
new building and pay for it. We train riders were not asked if we wanted a new 
place to park, nor were we asked if we wanted to subsidize the city's new 
building. 
</P>
<P>
I believe that the fair solution is to leave things as they are and have the 
city utilize its new parking building for theater patrons and shoppers. If the 
city must force the passengers to utilize this new building, then the least it 
could do is offer a parking pass costing in the neighborhood of $5 per month 
for a minimum of six months, increasing only annually, based on the cost of 
living. 
</P>
<P>
Oceanside, Santa Ana and Fullerton do not charge for parking at their stations. 
Does San Juan Capistrano want to be the bad guy and start the pay-for-parking 
routine in addition to the fares that passengers are paying?

JIM MURRAY: GEE, IT SEEMED LIKE SUCH A GOOD IDEA AT THE TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Throughout history, there have been words and syllables to strike terror into 
the hearts of mankind. "Geronimo" comes to mind. "Iceberg!" "Freeze!" 
"Gestapo." "Will the defendant please rise?" "Choose your weapon." "Typhoon!" 
</P>
<P>
But nothing can match the terror struck in the heart of a Ram fan when he hears 
the dreaded words over the TV: "Six defensive backs in the game for the Rams." 
It is the worst collection of words he could imagine. He is likely to throw 
himself on the floor screaming, "No, no, John! Please not that!" He can't bear 
to look. It's like hearing the dam broke. The water's rising. Smelling smoke. 
</P>
<P>
That's because, to a man, Ram fans know the next sound they will hear is six 
defensive backs just tackled a receiver who just caught a pass on the Ram two 
for first and goal. 
</P>
<P>
It's hard to tell on TV, but did it look to anyone else as if Steve Grogan 
could have walked into the end zone on the last play of the Ram-Patriot game 
last Sunday? He stood there so long untouched, another 10 seconds and pigeons 
would have begun to light on him. 
</P>
<P>
Ram fans are schooled to fear the worst. They are conditioned to believe if 
there are two ways to do a thing, the Rams will pick the one with the least 
chance of succeeding. The six-pack, or prevent, defense comes to mind. 
</P>
<P>
Calamity comes couched in soothing, non-alarming words. The notation of six 
defensive backs coming into the Ram lineup gives no clue to the uninitiate of 
the disaster ahead. And it's possible to imagine the inventor of this defense, 
George Allen, rubbing his hands and assuring his squad, "This can't miss! We 
get six guys to cover five! It's so easy, it should be illegal!" 
</P>
<P>
I'm sure George saw no cloud on the horizon, nothing to indicate what an abject 
failure his brainchild could become, how it would allow the canny old Steve 
Grogans of this world to pick it apart like an old rusty safe, to march lost 
causes right back into the teeth of contention. It's possible to muse on other 
innocuous mouthings as this decade comes to an end, to reflect on other bold 
predictions that might have preceded the most calamitous of events. Such as: 
</P>
<P>
1. Dennis Eckersley to manager, 1988 World Series, first game, two out, man on 
second, one-run lead and Kirk Gibson at bat. "Walk him? Why? He can hardly 
swing the bat. Watch this. I'll get him on a backdoor slider. It'll become a 
famous pitch." 
</P>
<P>
2. Tom Niedenfuer, roughly the same situation in the 1985 playoffs. "Put Jack 
Clark on? So what if there's a base open? Don't worry, I'm not going to give 
him anything good to hit." 
</P>
<P>
3. Dr. Feelgood to Ben Johnson on the eve of the Seoul Olympics. "I tell you, 
Ben, with this injection, you'll break 9.8. You'll leave Lewis in the blocks. 
Trust me. Who's gonna know?" 
</P>
<P>
4. Rival coach as the 49ers drafted Joe Montana. "They didn't draft him till 
the third round. They must not think much of him. Notre Dame quarterbacks never 
pan out. He'll just play backup to Steve DeBerg. They should have gone for a 
linebacker. Us? Naw, we didn't go for Montana. How could he help us? He's too 
skinny. We went for Jack Thompson and Steve Fuller." 
</P>
<P>
5. Rival coach when the Lakers drafted Magic Johnson. "They picked this kid on 
the basis of a nickname. He can't play. He's too big for a guard and too small 
for a forward. Where are they going to play him? They should have drafted 
Sidney Moncrief. David Greenwood. Johnson's just a smile. And a turnover." 
</P>
<P>
6. Lawyer to Pete Rose: "Just sit tight and deny everything. It'll blow over. 
The commissioner hasn't got a leg to stand on. Got anything good today in the 
fifth at Arlington?" 
</P>
<P>
7. Rival coach on Larry Bird: "He's slow and he can't jump. So, he can shoot a 
little bit. Big deal. Let the Celtics have him. They should have gone for Bill 
Cartwright. Or Joe Barry Carroll." 
</P>
<P>
8. Al Campanis to Dodger front office: "They just want me to go on 'Nightline' 
to talk a little bit about Jackie Robinson and the old days. I'll put in a good 
word for baseball." 
</P>
<P>
9. Barry Switzer to the president of Oklahoma. "Wait'll you see the new 
recruits we're bringing in! They'll make Oklahoma football the talk of the 
country!" 
</P>
<P>
10. General manager to Coach Chuck Knox, Seattle Seahawks: "What's the 
difference how much Brian Bosworth costs? He's a franchise player. He'll be the 
kind of player you only dream about!" 
</P>
<P>
11. Marvelous Marvin Hagler, pugilist. "Sugar Ray Leonard is crazy to fight me 
after a three-year layoff. I'll tell you one thing: He'll never fight again 
after this one!" 
</P>
<P>
12. American League owner to National League owner: "Collusion? What collusion? 
A couple of pals got together and decided not to buy any more $3-million, 
over-the-hill infielders. If that's collusion, my wife and I just colluded not 
to buy a new Cadillac this year. Can General Motors sue us? I tell you, they'll 
never make this stick in court! Where does it say in the Constitution I have to 
buy Tim Raines? Or Claude, for all of that?" 
</P>
<P>
13. Reporter to Sam Wyche, coach of the Cincinnati Bengals: "I know, Sam, but 
what do you really think of Jerry Glanville?" 
</P>
<P>
14. Pit crew to Al Unser Jr. at the '89 Indy: "Just run your car over on 
Emerson Fittipaldi at the main straight wall. He'll back off." 
</P>
<P>
The moral of the story is that even for the '80s, the law of physics applies: 
For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. For every guy who 
yells, "Hooray!" there is a guy in the shadows saying, "Oops!"

<P>
In the other wild-card game today, the Houston Oilers can end the season for 
the upstart Pittsburgh Steelers, the surprise team of the American Conference. 
</P>
<P>
And with the more experienced quarterback, Warren Moon, the Oilers, who have 
been in the playoffs in three successive winters, are widely expected to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
Having already beaten Pittsburgh twice this year, 27-0 and 23-16, they are 
favored to ruin quarterback Bubby Brister's postseason debut. 
</P>
<P>
"(Brister) has take-charge potential," Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll said 
Saturday. "But this is only his second season as a starter." 
</P>
<P>
The club's other hot prospect, running back Tim Worley, who was drafted first 
last April, is younger yet. The Georgia flyer, 23, came on fast after a slow 
start in September to run the Steelers into the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"(Worley) hasn't touched his potential," Noll said. "He can be a dominating 
runner." 
</P>
<P>
So that's why the Steelers are suddenly here -- 10 years after their last Super 
Bowl, and five years after their last playoff season. 
</P>
<P>
In Brister, 26, they think they have their best quarterback since Terry 
Bradshaw. A scrappy product of Northeast Louisiana, the Steelers' third draft 
pick in 1986, Brister has everything it takes to be a pro quarterback but the 
upper-body build. He is 6-feet-3 and 210 pounds, but tends to get hurt. 
</P>
<P>
In Worley, the Steelers say flatly, they finally have the running back they've 
wanted since Franco Harris retired. At 6-2 and 216, Worley ran the dashes for 
his school teams. 
</P>
<P>
By comparison, the Oilers will field a set of running backs today -- starting 
with Allen Pinkett and Alonzo Highsmith -- plus one of the NFL's great 
quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
Moon finished the season as the AFC's second-ranked passer. He had 23 
touchdowns to 14 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
Brister, who started 14 games, had nine touchdowns to 11 interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
This will be Houston Coach Jerry Glanville's first playoff game against one of 
his severest critics, Noll, but both men are resisting the urge to add any 
combustible elements to the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
"(Beating Glanville) isn't a motive we have trying to get our team ready," Noll 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Asked to comment, Glanville, who is 5-3 against Noll, said: "Nobody here is mad 
at Chuck." 
</P>
<P>
AFC Notes 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh and Houston, both play in the AFC Central, which has put three teams 
in the playoffs in each of the last two years. The Oilers beat Cleveland in 
last winter's wild card game, 24-23. . . . It has been only a year since Chuck 
Noll fired everyone on his defensive staff except the line coach, Mean Joe 
Greene. Noll gives much of the credit for Pittsburgh's improvement to his new 
defensive coordinator, NFL veteran Rod Rust. . . . Today's opponents, en route 
to 9-7 finishes, went through seasons that were much the same -- but in 
reverse. The Steelers lost their first two games by a composite 92-10, then won 
five of their last six. "I like to think that that's a plus," Noll said. . . . 
The Oilers, who lost their last two by a composite 85-27, got to the playoffs 
by winning five of the preceding six, including 23-7 over the Raiders. . . . In 
the Astrodome with Warren Moon, the Oilers are 6-2 this year and 18-4 in their 
last 22. 
</P>
<P>
In possibly the oddest news conference of the season, Noll seemed particularly 
ungrateful when informed that Jerry Glanville, in one of his strangest moves 
yet, had voted him coach of the year. Asked for his reaction, Noll said: "I 
don't know why (Glanville) had a vote." A reporter then asked: "Were you 
surprised that he voted for you?" Said Noll: "The thing that upsets me is that 
I didn't have a vote." 
</P>
<P>
Houston's best defensive end, Ray Childress, is doubtful. The Steelers have no 
serious injuries. . . . Cornerback Dwayne Woodruff is Pittsburgh's only 
survivor from the Super Bowl era. . . . The Oilers are one of only five NFL 
teams with winning records in each of the last three seasons.

HUSKIES MAKE IT LOOK EASY; 
</P>
<P>
FREEDOM BOWL: FLORIDA'S EMMITT SMITH IS HELD TO 17 YARDS AS WASHINGTON PASSES, 
RUNS TO 34-7 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
It was difficult to know exactly why it all went wrong for the University of 
Florida -- or how it all went right for Washington -- in the Freedom Bowl 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
But rest assured, Florida had a miserable day and Washington had a brilliant 
one. 
</P>
<P>
Florida's rushing game, led by All-American Emmitt Smith, ran smack dab into 
Washington's rock-solid defense and was rendered useless. Averaging 244 yards, 
Florida could scratch out just 121. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators couldn't stop Washington's efficient passing game or its steady 
rushing as the Huskies gained 217 yards on the ground and 242 through the air. 
</P>
<P>
It added up to a 34-7 Washington victory before 33,858 at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
The Huskies (8-4) scored on their first three possessions, building a 17-7 lead 
by the end of the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Florida (7-5) had given up only 28 points in the first quarter this season, 
just one more bad sign for the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
Washington quarterback Cary Conklin threw a 21-yard scoring pass to Mario 
Bailey on the Huskies' first drive. 
</P>
<P>
Florida (7-5) came right back on quarterback Donald Douglas' 67-yard touchdown 
run. But it proved to be the only resistance the Gators could muster. 
</P>
<P>
After the Huskies' second drive stalled at the Gator four-yard line, John 
McCallum kicked a 21-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Drive No. 3 ended in a 10-yard touchdown pass from Conklin to Andre Riley. 
</P>
<P>
After that, Washington's defense took over, bashing Smith to the turf at every 
turn. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm not sure there was a game this season where we had all three (kicking, 
offense and defense) going together for us," Washington Coach Don James said. 
</P>
<P>
The most notable statistics were Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
Smith, a junior who has twice finished in the top 10 in the Heisman Trophy 
voting, was held to 17 yards in seven carries. 
</P>
<P>
It was his lowest rushing total since the first game of his freshman season 
against Miami. Then, as a promising but untested reserve from Pensacola, Fla., 
Smith gained 16 yards in five carries. 
</P>
<P>
It was only the second time this season, and only the eighth time in his 
career, that he was held to less than 100 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to come into the game and run all over Washington," said 
Smith, who averaged 126 yards a game in the regular season. "When the defense 
is designed basically to stop the run, you're not going to run over them. It's 
not easy to run against an eight-man front." 
</P>
<P>
Eugene Burkhalter, a junior safety who seemed to be everywhere for the Huskies, 
thought it would be tougher to stop Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"All we had to worry about was Emmitt," Burkhalter said. "It looked to me like 
he didn't want to be out here. But I don't know if that's for me to say. 
</P>
<P>
"(Smith) wasn't effective, but that wasn't because of him. That was because of 
us." 
</P>
<P>
To be sure, Washington's defensive front, anchored by 6-foot-4, 300-pound end 
Dennis Brown and supported by Burkhalter, stifled the Gators. But time of 
possession was a factor, too. 
</P>
<P>
Washington controlled the ball for 41 minutes 52 seconds, leaving Florida the 
remaining 18:08. In the end, the Gators didn't have the ball so they couldn't 
run with it. 
</P>
<P>
After Florida fell behind, Smith played sparingly. He had only two carries for 
three yards in the second half as the Gators turned to the pass. 
</P>
<P>
That didn't work either. 
</P>
<P>
Douglas, a freshman, completed eight of 18 passes for 91 yards and one 
interception. Lex Smith, another freshman who replaced Douglas in the second 
quarter, was three of 10 for 57 yards. 
</P>
<P>
"Shutting down both their quarterbacks was a key," Brown said. "We were in the 
backfield causing a lot of havoc. And we had them confused for a while." 
</P>
<P>
Washington increased its lead to 24-7 when Jaime Fields recovered a blocked 
punt in the end zone for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
McCallum added a 32-yard field goal with 18 seconds left and the Huskies led, 
27-7, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Gators sputtered just as badly in the second half as their best scoring 
chance ended with Douglas fumbling at the Washington seven late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Washington added a 20-yard touchdown run by backup quarterback Mark Burnell for 
the final score. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin left the game with eight minutes to play after competing 21 of 39 
passes for 217 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm surprised the game was not close," said Conklin, who was named 
Washington's most valuable player. "We executed everything very well. It was 
fun out there. I felt like a doctor, just picking away. They weren't covering 
up people the whole first half." 
</P>
<P>
That was most evident on the Huskies' first touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Conklin found Bailey wide open down the middle for a 21-yard touchdown pass 
play. The Gators tried to cover Bailey with inside linebacker Jerry Odom, who 
was overmatched. 
</P>
<P>
"I knew right off the bat that we had a mismatch there," Conklin said. "We had 
the right play called and I knew (Bailey) could get a couple of steps on the 
linebacker." 
</P>
<P>
Washington's new one-back offense, designed to spread the defense, also made 
the Huskies' ground game stronger. 
</P>
<P>
Running back Greg Lewis found gaping holes on his way to 103 yards in 27 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
Washington's 217 yards rushing was the most Florida, fifth-ranked in the nation 
against the run, had given up this season. 
</P>
<P>
"Our offensive line manhandled them today," Lewis said. "When our offensive 
line is going like that, it makes things easier for me." 
</P>
<P>
Easy was the best way to describe Washington's victory.

FLYERS SCORE QUICKLY, BEAT KINGS, 6-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Kings thought they had left their Philadelphia nightmare behind them. The 
last thing they expected was to experience the same frightening dream at home. 
</P>
<P>
But in style and substance, Saturday night's 6-3 loss to the Philadelphia 
Flyers before 16,005 at the Forum was a replay of the first time these teams 
played this season. 
</P>
<P>
In that game, Dec. 16 at Philadelphia , the Flyers won, 5-2. King goaltender 
Kelly Hrudey was shelled for four goals in the second period and was pulled. 
Saturday night, Hrudey allowed four goals (on 11 shots) in 24 minutes and was 
pulled again. 
</P>
<P>
Both times backup Mario Gosselin replaced Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
How similar was this to the first game? 
</P>
<P>
"Very. Quite similar," King Coach Tom Webster said. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the Kings agreed. 
</P>
<P>
"The first time, they caught us at the end of a road trip and maybe we were 
tired," Wayne Gretzky said. "Tonight, there was really no excuse. We got behind 
them and couldn't catch up. They played well and we didn't play very well." 
</P>
<P>
The game didn't begin on a promising note for the Kings (19-15-4), as the 
Flyers (18-17-4) scored on their first two shots. 
</P>
<P>
On the first, Pelle Eklund hovered at the right point, then found Tony Horacek, 
who scored the first of his three goals. 
</P>
<P>
The second Flyer goal came again from the right point. Left wing Derrick Smith 
cruised into the King zone and fired a crisp slap shot past Hrudey. 
</P>
<P>
"The idea was for us to come out and set the tempo and take it to them," 
Webster said. "When you get behind, you have to take chances. When you take 
chances against them, they take advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
The period had few penalty minutes, but the Kings did get two power plays. They 
failed to convert on either. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings, who have the best power play percentage in the NHL, went zero for 
five Saturday. The Flyers, the league's best penalty killers, saw to that. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings' only goal of the period came shortly after their second power play 
had expired. Gretzky skated up the middle into the Flyer zone and was picked up 
by two Philadelphia defenders. 
</P>
<P>
He passed to Steve Kasper, who drifted to the left of the net. Finally, he 
out-waited Flyer goaltender Ken Wregget and slid the puck between Wregget's 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
The Flyers built a 5-1 lead in the second period, only to see that whittled to 
5-3. 
</P>
<P>
Philadelphia struck for three unanswered goals by midway through the period. 
The first two came within 43 seconds of each other. On the first, Mike Bullard 
skated through the King defense and took a shot that rebounded in off 
defenseman Larry Robinson's skate. 
</P>
<P>
The second goal belonged to Horacek, who redirected Gord Murphy's shot off the 
shaft of his stick. That gave the Flyers a 4-1 lead at 4:22. After that, 
Webster replaced Hrudey with Gosselin. 
</P>
<P>
Hrudey called the Flyers' third and fourth goals "lucky," noting that the puck 
bounced off objects other than stick blades before they went in. 
</P>
<P>
Gosselin then got a taste of what Hrudey had faced, when he was beaten by 
Horacek. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings then became aggressive. The forwards began back-checking, and the 
defenseman began to do what the Flyers had done -- knock their men off the 
puck. 
</P>
<P>
The Kings began to come back. 
</P>
<P>
Working in his customary spot behind the net, Gretzky passed out front to 
Robinson. His shot was stopped, but Mike Krushelnyski got the rebound and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
Luc Robitaille scored at the end of the period, to stretch his goal-scoring 
streak to eight games, which is tied for the longest in the NHL this season. 
</P>
<P>
Few teams feel safe holding even a two-goal lead against the Kings, even the 
Flyers. They extended their lead to 6-3 on a goal by Rick Tocchet at 8:35 of 
the third period. 
</P>
<P>
Any realistic chance the Kings had of making up the deficit was shattered when 
Bernie Nicholls received a high-sticking major penalty for jabbing 
Philadelphia's Mark Howe in the face. That gave Nicholls a game misconduct and 
the Flyers a five-minute power play with barely six minutes left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
King Notes 
</P>
<P>
The Kings next game is New Year's Day at Washington, the first in a four-game 
trip. That game at Washington is an afternoon game, beginning at 10:30 Pacific 
time. That doesn't sit well with Wayne Gretzky. "Fly all that way and turn 
around and play a day game. It's asinine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
It is becoming normal for the Kings to be substantially out-shot in games. In 
38 games, the Kings have been out-shot 29 times. "It's been the trademark of 
this club all year," King Coach Tom Webster said. "We don't get a lot of shots. 
Some guys like to look for the pretty shot." Though the Kings may be taking the 
high-percentage shots, this style puts tremendous pressure on their defense and 
goaltenders. . . . Defenseman Barry Beck slammed into the boards in the third 
period and left the game. Webster said Beck suffered a concussion and was taken 
to the hospital. . . . Luc Robitaille is second in the league in goal scoring 
with 31. He is second in power play goals with 12. Wayne Gretzky leads the 
league in assists with 60, Bernie Nicholls is fourth with 39. Gretzky also is 
the NHL's point leader with 80. Steve Duchesne is ninth in scoring among 
defensemen.

SUGAR BOWL: BERNARD CLARK, THE MAN IN MIDDLE OF MIAMI'S PUNISHING DEFENSE, HAS 
A MOUTHFUL OF WORDS FOR OPPONENTS.

Tiger says if the Grim Reaper doesn't get you, Dr. Death surely will. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger says there are just two kinds of college football players -- those who 
play at Miami and those who get beat by Miami. Tiger says it's cool to rap with 
the people you're playing, celebrate their misfortune and revel in your own. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger says Miami fans sitting in the closed end zone of the Orange Bowl, where 
the Hurricanes play their home games, carry cardboard tombstones with the names 
of each of the dearly departed teams that have been collected by the Grim 
Reaper. Or Dr. Death. Or perhaps even Tiger himself. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger says he is proud and happy to be part of a group of linebackers called 
the Graveyard. Tiger says this is what college football is all about. 
</P>
<P>
"Every little thing, just psychological warfare," Tiger said. "You got to mess 
with people. 
</P>
<P>
"I mean, go up against a linebacker corps that calls themselves the Graveyard," 
Tiger said. "I mean, you got to wonder why they call themselves the Graveyard. 
Whoever comes in here is going to get buried. Then you hit them and you tell 
them, 'Welcome to the Graveyard.' " 
</P>
<P>
And welcome to the world of Bernard (Tiger) Clark, named by his sister after he 
took a swing at her from his crib as a 2-year-old. This Tiger is the 
fast-talking, hard-hitting, field-roving, dance-omatic middle linebacker of the 
Miami Hurricanes, the leader of a punishing defense that said more while 
allowing fewer points and less yardage than any other team in the nation this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
On a team with an uncanny ability to incinerate and infuriate opponents at the 
same time, Tiger Clark may be the undisputed leader in both departments. 
</P>
<P>
When No. 2 Miami (10-1) meets No. 7 Alabama (10-1) Monday night in the 
Superdome, the story of the Sugar Bowl could very well be a Tiger tale. Sure, 
defensive backs Charles Pharms, a.k.a. the Grim Reaper, and Bobby Harden, 
a.k.a. Dr. Death, equal Tiger in nicknames, but the 6-foot-2, 246-pound Clark 
is probably without peer in the area of intimidation, which the whole Miami 
team has managed to elevate into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
If Andy Warhol inspired Pop Art, Bernard Clark is probably responsible for 
Pop-off Art. In fact, Clark may have perfected it, with the field his canvas, 
his mouth a brush. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger put on a masterful performance in Miami's 27-10 victory over previously 
unbeaten and No. 1 Notre Dame. Not only did Clark lead all defenders with 13 
tackles, five assists and an interception, he also ended the game with a 
flourish that was vintage Tiger. 
</P>
<P>
He tackled Rick Mirer for a loss, then helped himself up by putting his hand on 
Mirer's head. Clark goose-stepped like a drum major the 10 yards into the end 
zone. Tiger's extemporaneous dance thrilled his fans, and he stood there and 
took in their applause. 
</P>
<P>
Tiger's explanation was that he couldn't help himself because, after all, he 
simply was bursting with exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
"I was just dancing because I was so proud," he said. "You tell me the dance I 
did in the end zone, was that a bad dance? I didn't think so. I just look at it 
like I'm having fun. 
</P>
<P>
"People have a negative image about us," Clark said. "If one of our guys was to 
go into the end zone and pray, they'd probably say he was praying to Satan." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sound of Irish teeth gnashing at the Clark spectacle might have 
been heard coast to coast. On Notre Dame radio and television, listeners were 
told this is the precise reason why the Irish don't like playing the 
Hurricanes. But Miami linebacker coach Tom Tuberville doesn't think there's any 
need to absolve Clark for doing what the Hurricane staff encourages in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
"Let me tell you something," Tuberville said. "If I had been over there, I'd 
have done it with him. 
</P>
<P>
"Tiger, he doesn't showboat, he just shows his emotions. Tiger is one of the 
guys that when he makes a good play, he wants to show his emotions. If you tie 
him down to where he couldn't enjoy playing that kind of football, then I don't 
think he'd be as effective as he is. 
</P>
<P>
"These kids are a little different down here. We want them to have fun. We are 
not going to tie them down. We don't taunt anybody. That's the biggest thing 
I've seen that people ridicule us for. We make plays, we like for our kids to 
celebrate. There are times when we celebrated too much. When it gets to that 
point, then we'll make them stop." 
</P>
<P>
Neither former defensive coordinator Dave Wannstedt, who joined Jimmy Johnson 
when he left to coach the Dallas Cowboys, nor Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said 
taunting was allowed, but there is plenty of evidence that it happened anyway. 
Former Miami defensive back Bennie Blades said aggressive play was not the only 
thing passed down from the older players. 
</P>
<P>
"It's like a gene you pass down to a family member," Blades said. "We taunted 
to intimidate people, to scare them. And taunting wasn't always getting in 
someone's face, it was like after you made a good hit, leaning over them and 
saying something like, 'Come back the next time.' That scared some people." 
</P>
<P>
That's also not really taunting. But taunting or no taunting, the Hurricanes 
have a rich history of, well, enjoying themselves at someone else's expense. In 
Miami's 58-7 victory over Notre Dame in 1987, Blades intercepted a pass and 
high-fived a teammate as he ran down the field with the ball on his way toward 
the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
As Pharms said, "We're not nice guys as far as on the field goes." 
</P>
<P>
Clark said the obvious edge the Hurricanes are looking for is psychological. 
The image Miami cultivates should be clear to all by now.

"That we're bad boys," Clark said. "People think they are going to play a bunch 
of ruthless guys. Second of all, when I'm on the field, I'm constantly talking, 
trying to take them out of their game. I'm saying, 'Look out, here comes 
someone, you're going to get sacked this time,' stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
And what are the suitable topics for conversation? Apparently, anything goes. 
</P>
<P>
"Different guys talk about the guys' girlfriends, they talk about their mother 
and stuff like that," Clark said. "A lot of guys can't handle it. I think it's 
totally ridiculous and you're not a real athlete if you can let someone talk 
you out of your game. 
</P>
<P>
"We played someone this year, I won't tell you who, and a guy called me a 
nigger," Clark said. "I just looked at him and laughed. I said 'You can't think 
of nothing more creative than that?' I mean, things like that don't bother me. 
You can't take me out of my game. When I'm ready to play, I'm just ready to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
The way Miami conducts its business on defense, Clark is showcased as the 
principal element in stopping the run. What the Hurricanes do is to keep Clark 
free by covering the blocks of both guards and the center with their two down 
linemen. In return, Clark's part of the bargain is to stop cold any inside 
rushing attempt. 
</P>
<P>
Against Alabama, Clark won't be involved in normal pass coverage, mostly 
because the Hurricanes believe the Crimson Tide will flood the field with 
play-action passes to freeze the linebackers and throw just behind them. Delays 
out of the backfield and screen passes belong in Clark's domain, and Tuberville 
said his prize pupil recognizes what is his and takes it. 
</P>
<P>
"He's definitely our team leader," Tuberville said. "He'll get 'em straightened 
out in the huddle. He runs our defense, he knows every linebacker position, he 
knows the drops in all our passing schemes and he's our quarterback on defense. 
Bernard Clark football is 100% total hustle the whole time, from sideline to 
sideline." 
</P>
<P>
The era of Bernard Clark football at Miami was first evident in the 1988 Orange 
Bowl game. Starting middle linebacker George Mira was suspended for testing 
positive for steroids, so Clark stepped in against Oklahoma, and everything 
just sort of fell into place. Clark made 14 tackles, the Hurricanes beat the 
Sooners, 20-14, to win their second national title and Clark was named the 
game's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, when Maurice Crum emerged as a standout Hurricane outside linebacker, 
which was then Clark's position, Tiger was sent to the bench to begin the 1988 
season and finally moved to the middle. The results were not impressive. 
</P>
<P>
"He really didn't play very well because he was passive against the run," said 
Tuberville, who had a long heart-to-heart talk with Clark in spring practice 
this year. The message was simple: "We told him he had to play inside and he 
had to be a big factor on stopping the run -- he had to have a great year for 
us to have a great year." 
</P>
<P>
Clark had one great game, against Notre Dame; one pretty good one, against 
Florida State, and didn't play at all in three games because of a knee injury. 
The Hurricanes' 24-10 loss to the Seminoles was Clark's first game since he 
hurt his knee in the second quarter of a 38-7 victory over Missouri. Although 
Clark had eight tackles, he wasn't playing at full strength. 
</P>
<P>
"We played very average that night," Clark said. "I'm not going to blame it on 
the injury, but I gave it everything I got. The fact that I was hurt against 
Florida State really doesn't make a difference because I still played a pretty 
good game. The reason I did stick out was because we lost. I was in on 13 
tackles (including five assisted), broke up a pass, had some pressure on the 
quarterback. I've been coming on strong every game." 
</P>
<P>
In each of Miami's final three games -- victories over Pittsburgh, San Diego 
State and Notre Dame -- Clark was named his team's player of the game. 
</P>
<P>
"He just dominated," Tuberville said. 
</P>
<P>
Clark has made it his quest to stand out. To start with, there is this thing 
with his hair. Two years ago, he shaved little lightning bolts above each ear. 
Last season, Clark shaved the word MIAMI just above the back of his neck. This 
season, Clark shaved his whole head before each game. 
</P>
<P>
Since almost the first time he thought about big-time football, when he was 
playing Little League for the Tampa Spartans in the West Tampa Boys and Girls 
Club, Bernard Clark has decided to be a little different. The son of a longtime 
Delta Airlines employee and a mother who raised four children and then went 
back to school to become a registered nurse, young Tiger's first hero was his 
cousin, Johnny Davis, who carried the hopes of the family. 
</P>
<P>
A Little League star with the same Spartan team Tiger yearned to play for, 
Davis eventually wound up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
The elder Clark was a football star at the then all-black Blake High in Tampa, 
Fla., who took a job to provide for his family instead of going to college. 
When young Bernard quit the junior varsity team at Tampa's Leto High, his 
mother drove him straight back to the practice field and made him apologize to 
his coach. 
</P>
<P>
"The thing my dad gave me is to be real honest with people, to tell people 
what's on my mind," he said. "My mother, I get a lot of strength from her. She 
wouldn't let me quit anything. That's how it was when I got to college. They 
said, 'You're not giving up until you get your degree.' Well, I got mine May 13 
at 8:30 (in business administration) in the morning, on a Friday. Now, I think 
I kind of got them off my back."

The newest postseason college football game, the Copper Bowl, is having trouble 
drawing attention and ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
The Copper Bowl debuts today (5 p.m. PST) with North Carolina State playing 
Arizona. But the game between the 7-4 teams may be played before a half-empty 
house. 
</P>
<P>
Only 30,000 tickets had been sold as of Saturday morning, though Arizona 
Stadium seats 57,000, and officials said with TBS' broadcast of the game being 
aired in Tucson and the chance of cold, rainy weather, even a turnout of 35,000 
"would be hopeful." 
</P>
<P>
North Carolina State lost its last three games.

CLEMSON DEFENSE ROUGHS UP WEST VIRGINIA, 27-7

<P>
Clemson's defense became West Virginia's nightmare in the Gator Bowl game 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
"They ran us down from behind and from everyplace else," West Virginia Coach 
Don Nehlen said after the Tigers capitalized on four second-half turnovers and 
beat the Mountaineers, 27-7. 
</P>
<P>
Clemson linebacker Levon Kirkland said the Tigers' speed overwhelmed West 
Virginia, frustrating quarterback Major Harris, who committed all four 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
"He really hadn't seen speed like we had," Kirkland said. "We weren't playing 
Harris, we were playing the whole team." 
</P>
<P>
Harris had one pass intercepted and lost three fumbles, the last being 
recovered in the end zone by Clemson's Chester McGlockton for a touchdown that 
gave the Tigers a 24-7 lead with 8:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"I hurt the team," Harris said. "I made a couple of key mistakes. It's really 
hard for you to drive down the field against a team like Clemson." 
</P>
<P>
Clemson Coach Danny Ford said: "I don't think I can be disappointed with any 
phase of our football team. I think we made him (Harris) have some nervous 
feet, and we didn't allow him to use the sideline as well as he has in some 
games this year." 
</P>
<P>
Joe Henderson and Wesley McFadden also scored on short runs for Clemson, which 
closed out a 10-2 season with its fifth consecutive victory. Clemson has won 
four consecutive bowl games. The 17th-ranked Mountaineers fell to 8-3-1, losing 
their third consecutive postseason game. It was the first time the two schools 
had met on a football field. 
</P>
<P>
Henderson's four-yard touchdown run early in the fourth quarter gave the Tigers 
a 17-7 lead. The scoring drive was set up when Harris fumbled at the West 
Virginia 43. 
</P>
<P>
West Virginia managed to move into Clemson territory only twice after scoring 
on its initial drive. And on both of those occasions, Harris turned the ball 
over on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
The Clemson defense, which had forced 34 turnovers during the regular season, 
also sacked Harris three times for losses totaling 18 yards. Harris, who 
finished third in this season's Heisman Trophy voting, passed for 119 yards and 
ran for only 17 yards in 11 attempts. 
</P>
<P>
A Gator Bowl record 82,911 watched Clemson bounce back from a 7-0 deficit to 
dominate the Mountaineers and prevent a sweep by major eastern independents in 
bowl games. Syracuse, Pittsburgh and Penn State all have won bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
McFadden's one-yard run with 2:54 left in the second quarter and Chris 
Gardocki's extra-point kick gave Clemson a 10-7 halftime lead. The Tigers used 
8:54 of the second quarter on the 17-play, 80-yard drive.

SYRACUSE SAVES ITS BEST FOR LAST, BEATS GEORGIA

<P>
John Biskup kicked the field goal that won the Peach Bowl for Syracuse, but to 
Coach Dick MacPherson, backup quarterback Mark McDonald was the star. 
</P>
<P>
McDonald hit Michael Owens for 29 yards on fourth-and-five with 2:09 remaining 
Saturday, setting up Biskup's 26-yard kick with 25 seconds left as the 
Orangemen rallied to beat Georgia, 19-18. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was just magnificent what he did on that fourth-down play," 
MacPherson said. "It was just very special. He really had to lay that one up 
there." 
</P>
<P>
McDonald lofted the ball over linebacker Demetrius Douglas and Owens, who also 
had 116 yards rushing, caught it along the sideline and raced to the Georgia 28 
before being knocked out of bounds. 
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the games that all of us will remember," said McDonald, who 
relieved starter Bill Scharr early in the third quarter and rallied Syracuse 
from an 18-7 deficit by completing 10 of 13 passes for 135 yards and a 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
"This was our best performance of the year and my best performance as well," 
said Owens, who had five catches for 62 yards and was voted Syracuse's top 
offensive performer. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse (8-4) moved 64 yards in 11 plays to set up Biskup's game-winning kick. 
</P>
<P>
"Out defense played well and gave us opportunities to win the football game," 
Georgia Coach Ray Goff said. "We didn't take advantage of those opportunities, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
The Bulldogs managed just 202 yards on offense, with tailback Rodney Hampton, 
who had 1,059 yards during the regular season, held to only 32 yards in 15 
carries. He did manage to catch seven passes for 62 yards and was named 
Georgia's top offensive performer. 
</P>
<P>
Syracuse gained 478 yards but had four turnovers, although Georgia managed to 
turn only one into a score, a 20-yard field goal by John Kasay. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't think they could turn it around with one play," said Georgia 
defensive tackle Bill Goldberg. "I thought it would take a series of plays. But 
then they were like a freight train to stop." 
</P>
<P>
Georgia's Greg Talley threw two touchdown passes to help the Bulldogs to the 
18-7 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
Georgia (6-6), playing in its 10th consecutive bowl, saw its lead cut on a 
32-yard field goal by Biskup with 1:44 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The Orangemen, making their third consecutive bowl appearance, made it 18-16 
when Rob Moore caught a 19-yard scoring pass from McDonald 4:52 into the final 
quarter. But McDonald overthrew Andrew Dees in the end zone in a bid for the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
Talley connected on a five-yard touchdown pass to Kirk Warner to cap a 66-yard 
drive on Georgia's first possession, then threw a four-yard touchdown to 
Hampton midway in the third quarter to put the Bulldogs ahead, 18-7. Georgia's 
bid for a two-point conversion failed.

GATHERS GETS 22 IN RETURN FOR LOYOLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN DROOZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Loyola Marymount played an average game Saturday night, dispatching visiting 
Niagara, 122-87, in businesslike fashion. 
</P>
<P>
The mismatch lacked the intensity of recent matchups with ranked opponents 
Oregon State and Oklahoma and was notable for the return of Loyola's Hank 
Gathers to the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
With Bo Kimble scoring 38 points -- just over his average -- and Gathers adding 
22, the Lions were right on their scoring average. Jeff Fryer added 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers hit 10 of 19 shots and grabbed 11 rebounds in 24 minutes, despite 
missing some plays he normally makes. 
</P>
<P>
"Hank (did) about what we expected," Lion Coach Paul Westhead said. "He showed 
flashes of playing well, at times he was off. I thought he played well, but 
from past performances that wasn't the Hank you see all the time. It wasn't 
bad, though." 
</P>
<P>
Kimble, who had to do less inside work with Gathers back, hit six of nine 
three-point shots and 15 of 23 shots overall -- just another day at the office. 
"I was very relaxed today," Kimble said. "I took what the defense gave me." The 
victory sends Loyola on a three-game trip to Ohio and Philadelphia with a 7-2 
record. Niagara (1-10) got career-high efforts of 32 points from Patrick Jones 
and 29 from Darren Brown. 
</P>
<P>
Despite Niagara's efforts to control the pace, Loyola quickly pulled away, 
building a 63-37 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Gathers, back in the lineup for the first time in three weeks after fainting in 
his last appearance Dec. 9, didn't take long to get going. He scored four of 
the Lions' first eight points and had nine as Loyola built a 21-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The three-point shooters then took over, with Kimble hitting four long ones as 
the Lions' lead reached 28 points. Loyola hit seven three-point shots in the 
first half. Kimble had 16 points and Gathers 13 by the break. The Lions hit 10 
three-point baskets overall. 
</P>
<P>
"For being out two weeks I was in pretty good shape," Gathers said. "I knew my 
timing would be off a little, I got stripped a few times, which is very 
unusual. I blew the lungs out a few times, and everything's OK." 
</P>
<P>
The Lions hit the 100-point mark with 6:30 remaining and built the lead to more 
than 30 points. 
</P>
<P>
Loyola forced 21 turnovers, outrebounded the Eagles, 45-42, and made 10 more 
field goals.

Anderson Hunt scored 28 points, including five three-point baskets in the

No. 11 Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
UNLV (7-2) trailed, 48-44, at halftime, but the Rebels started the second half 
with a 9-2 run on baskets by Greg Anthony, Stacey Augmon and Larry Johnson and 
a three-point basket by Hunt. 
</P>
<P>
The Rebels led, 84-75, with six minutes to play after Hunt made four 
three-point baskets during an eight-minute span.

Arkansas guard Todd Day made four three-point baskets that kept the Razorbacks 
(8-2) close until the final minutes.

Anthony scored 20 points for UNLV and Augmon added 19.

"We played a great basketball team today," Arkansas Coach Nolan Richardson

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP;

MEMPHIS STATE GETS GILLED BY ILLINOIS

<P>
Kendall Gill scored 22 points and had 10 rebounds Saturday as fourth-ranked 
Illinois defeated No. 15 Memphis State, 83-71, in the championship of the Old 
Style tournament at Rosemont, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
But it was Gill's defense that kept Illinois (10-0) undefeated. 
</P>
<P>
Gill, a 6-foot-6 senior, was instrumental in holding Memphis State's Elliot 
Perry to 17 points in a matchup of two of the country's best guards. Perry had 
scored 33 in Memphis State's overtime victory over Ball State Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think Perry hurt us that much," Illinois Coach Lou Henson said. "We 
did as good a job on Perry as you can do." 
</P>
<P>
Gill said he wanted to keep Perry on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
"I tried to not let him drive too much," said Gill, who was voted the 
tournament MVP. "He's a good ballplayer. . . . I think he hurt himself a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State Coach Larry Finch said Perry was fatigued after playing 43 
minutes in the first-round game late Friday night. Perry, a junior, had to 
leave the game with a leg cramp for 2 1/2 minutes in the second half as the 
Tigers were trying to rally. 
</P>
<P>
"We were a little tired . . . but that is no excuse for not playing up to our 
ability," Perry said. "No matter how tired you are, you still have to go out 
and play hard." 
</P>
<P>
Marcus Liberty scored 25 points and Illinois held a 44-33 rebounding edge as 
6-foot-7 center-forward Ervin Small had 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
Gill scored 16 points in the first half and Liberty added 12 as Illinois took 
control early. 
</P>
<P>
Memphis State's only lead came at the start on Todd Mundt's two free throws. 
Illinois scored the next nine points before Memphis State closed to 18-13. The 
Illini then went on a 14-5 run over the next six minutes. 
</P>
<P>

No. 2 Kansas 83, Stanford 61 -- Jeff Gueldner sparked a 22-7 run as the 
Jayhawks ended the Cardinal's nine-game winning streak by winning the BMA 
Holiday tournament title at Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Five minutes into the second half, Kansas (13-0) was ahead, 54-35. 
</P>

game at Ann Arbor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
Demetrius Calip scored 18 of his 20 points in the first half as Michigan (10-1) 
gained a 52-36 halftime lead. Michigan, the 65th team to win 1,000 games, has 
won 10 in a row since a season-opening loss to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
No. 6 Oklahoma 99, Tulsa 78 -- The Sooners were held to fewer than 130 points 
for only the second time this season, but Tony Martin scored 27 points and 
sparked big runs in each half in helping his team win the All-College 
Tournament at Oklahoma City. 
</P>
<P>
No. 7 Missouri 119, Kearney State 88 -- Anthony Peeler (24 points) and Travis 
Ford (20) ended shooting slumps to lead the Tigers at Columbia, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
Peeler came off the bench to make 10 of 20 shots and get eight assists, and 
Ford, starting his first game, made seven of 10 from the field, including four 
of six three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
Nathan Buntin had 15 points and 13 rebounds for Missouri (11-1). Jamal Coleman 
scored 14, Brad Sutton added 12 and John McIntyre had 10 for the Tigers, who

scored two baskets in an 11-2 spurt midway in the second half that carried the 
Cardinals to victory at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
Kentucky (5-5) had rallied from a 42-35 halftime deficit to take a 60-59 lead 
when Sean Woods drove the length of the floor for a layup with 10:54 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
No. 9 Louisiana State 100, Hardin-Simmons 66 -- All-American guard Chris 
Jackson broke a two-game slump with 27 points at Baton Rouge, La. 
</P>
<P>
No. 18 Iowa 55, Monmouth, N.J. 46 -- The Hawkeyes made eight of 10 free throws 
in the final four minutes and rallied in the second half at Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Ingram's basket with 3:53 to play gave Iowa (8-1) a 45-40 lead, but 
Alex Blackwell's basket pulled Monmouth (3-6) within three before the Hawkeyes 
made the free throws to put the game away.

<P>
Twenty players on the Tri-City Americans Hockey Club refused to play their 
Western Hockey League game at the Tri-Cities Coliseum against the Portland 
Winter Hawks Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
The revolt surrounded Bill LaForge, hired by Americans' owner Ron Dixon Dec. 17 
to become director of hockey operations. 
</P>
<P>
A player for the Americans who requested anonymity telephoned the Tri-City 
Herald on Saturday and said: "We won't play until Bill LaForge is out of the 
organization. If LaForge is fired, we might play (Sunday) in Portland." 
</P>
<P>
Management of the two WHL clubs agreed that the game would be considered 
canceled, but the prospect of the teams playing their scheduled game today in 
Portland remained uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
Efforts to reach Dixon by phone were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
WHL President Ed Chynoweth, in a telephone interview from his home in Calgary, 
Canada, said: "We are attempting to get the players to agree to play in 
Portland. I have offered my services as the arbitrator to sort out their 
differences." 
</P>
<P>
LaForge, 38, came to the Americans after being fired as coach of the Niagara 
Falls Thunder of the Ontario Hockey League. LaForge has a 4-14-2 record this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
"What can I say," LaForge said Saturday. "I thought that when I came everything 
was copacetic." 
</P>
<P>
The player said the team met for seven hours Friday night and decided to 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
"We had come back from Christmas break and had two days of practice (with Coach 
Rick Kozuback) before LaForge showed up," he said. "It was the best two days of 
practice we've ever had. 
</P>
<P>
"Then Friday afternoon, LaForge comes in and takes over. He didn't even 
introduce himself. He just starts swearing at us and telling us what he's going 
to do to us. We wanted to give him a chance. He just lost it. He turned 
everybody off. We want him out of here." 
</P>
<P>
LaForge said that he and Kozuback spoke with the players at the hotel earlier 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them last night that I would not go behind the bench (and coach)," 
LaForge said. "If they want to play for Rick, that's fine. I'm only here to 
help them win in the long term, not the short term. I'm here to prepare the 
(50-man protected) list for the future."

Steve Scott became the first two-time champion of the Fiesta Bowl Mile, beating 
Doug Padilla by one-tenth of a second in the fifth-annual race through the 
streets of downtown Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
Scott, 33, finished in a time of 4:05.6 -- well off his American record in the 
mile of 3:47.69. 
</P>
<P>
Padilla, 33, had broken away from the pack in the elite 10-man field with 450 
yards to go and appeared on his way to being the fifth different winner of the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
But Scott, a two-time Olympian, outkicked Padilla in the final 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Scott earned $5,000 for the victory. Padilla received $3,000 and Ireland's Ray 
Flynn earned $1,000 for third place at 4:06.1. 
</P>
<P>
Ireland's Marcus O'Sullivan, the 1987 winner, finished fourth at 4:06.5. 
</P>
<P>
Former Arizona State sprinter Jeff Smith was fifth (4:07.1) followed by 
Canada's Doug Consiglio (4:09.4), former Arizona State track standout Treg 
Scott (4:09.8), defending champion Jeff Atkinson (4:11.4), Canada's Graeme Fell 
(4:12.5) and Charles Marsala (4:16.5) of Bloomington, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
Atkinson, a 1988 Olympian from Manhattan Beach, won last year's race in 
4:05.20.

NEWSWIRE: LOSING CBA COACH IS CHARGED WITH ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Charley Rosen, coach of the Rockford (Ill.) Lightning of the Continental 
Basketball Assn., was arrested after storming out of a locker room and punching 
the coach of the Cedars Rapids, Iowa, team. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen, 49, a former English professor and sportswriter, was charged Friday 
night with assault, interference with official acts and disorderly conduct. He 
posted $405 bond and left Cedar Rapids with his team. 
</P>
<P>
The dispute began after Rosen was kicked out of the game with 90 seconds left 
after receiving his second technical foul. He attempted to charge Cedar Rapids 
Coach George Whittaker, but was restrained by officials. 
</P>
<P>
As the players were leaving the court after Cedar Rapids' 119-98 victory, Rosen 
again charged Whittaker, witnesses said. Security men and police wrestled Rosen 
away from Whittaker and pushed him back into the locker room. Additional police 
were called in to arrest Rosen, described in the CBA media guide as the 
league's tallest coach at 6-foot-8. 
</P>
<P>
Rosen has been suspended by the league on at least two occasions. His last 
run-in was on Nov. 26, 1988, when he drew four technical fouls in a game at 
Rapid City, S.D., and accused the officials of fixing the game. The league 
suspended him for four games, fined him an undisclosed amount and placed him on 
probation.

DARNELL LEFT WAITING FOR WORD, AND THE AX; 
</P>
<P>
FOOTBALL: SPURRIER IS REPLACED AT DUKE BUT HAS NOT ANNOUNCED WHETHER HE WILL 
ACCEPT COACHING JOB AT FLORIDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Gary Darnell said his postgame speech to players Saturday was the toughest 
since he took over as Florida's coach in October. 
</P>
<P>
Just minutes after Florida's 34-7 loss to Washington in the Freedom Bowl game 
at Anaheim Stadium, Gator players were still wondering who would be coaching 
them next season. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell didn't know. He was full of questions, but had few answers, about his 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"I told them I couldn't tell them anything," Darnell said. "I was apologetic in 
some regards." 
</P>
<P>
It seems clear, however, that Darnell won't be back, at least as head coach. 
</P>
<P>
Bill Arnsparger, Florida's athletic director, has confirmed that Steve 
Spurrier, who led Duke to an 8-4 record this season, has the job if he wants 
it. But Spurrier, who has already been replaced at Duke, has made no 
announcement about his plans. 
</P>
<P>
Barry Wilson, one of Spurrier's assistants, was named the Blue Devils' coach 
Saturday by Duke Athletic Director Tom Butters. 
</P>
<P>
"I was disappointed that I didn't know," Darnell said. "I felt like all the 
hocus-pocus was over. 
</P>
<P>
"This team will disband and have to learn things a different way, and I'm not 
too happy about that." 
</P>
<P>
Darnell has coached the Gators to a 3-4 record since taking over for Galen Hall 
five games into the season. He was the defensive coordinator under Hall for two 
years and had been an assistant at Wake Forest, North Carolina and Kansas 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Hall was forced to resign Oct. 8 after admitting to NCAA rules violations for 
paying $22,000 in salary supplements to two former assistants. 
</P>
<P>
Then, on Oct. 16, the university suspended starting quarterback Kyle Morris, 
reserve quarterback Shane Matthews and two walk-on players for gambling on pro 
and college games. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell said the suspensions and coaching change haven't been a distraction for 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
"And you think it would be," he said. "I told the fellas 'I'm just like you.' I 
want the same thing, to have a good football team and maintain the educational 
process." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Pat Moorer said the players were wondering all week about the team's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
"Coach Darnell talked to us about all we were reading in the press," Moorer 
said. "He said he didn't know what was going to happen after this week but that 
we should concentrate on the game." 
</P>
<P>
Florida had problems doing that. Semester exams and travel took its toll on his 
players, Darnell said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was hurry, hurry, hurry and we never got focused in on the game," he said. 
"We were really loose before the game and that's not our normal mentality. 
</P>
<P>
"I felt too many eyes starting to wander. The game was slipping back as far as 
significance." 
</P>
<P>
Freshman quarterback Donald Douglas, who scored Florida's only touchdown on a 
67-yard run in the first quarter, said blaming the loss on the distractions 
wasn't fair. 
</P>
<P>
"We came into this game prepared to win and our coaches did a good job," he 
said. "We just lost." 
</P>
<P>
Darnell also drew a vote of confidence from tailback Emmitt Smith, who has yet 
to announce his plans. 
</P>
<P>
"Our coaches did their job and prepared us as best they could," said Smith, who 
is considering skipping his senior year at Florida to apply for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
Darnell said he and his assistants are prepared to handle the news about their 
future -- good or bad. 
</P>
<P>
When asked if he would stay at Florida as an assistant coach, Darnell said: "I 
don't think that's my call. That's another man's call."

EDISON PLAYS GIANT-KILLER AGAIN, DEFEATS OCEAN VIEW

Edison High School has continually toppled taller teams, and Saturday night's 
Marina tournament final was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers defeated previously unbeaten Ocean View, 58-53, and its 6-3 center 
Jennifer Sullivan, the Sunset League's most valuable player last season. 
</P>
<P>
"They just have so much heart, it makes up for that lack of inches," Edison 
Coach Philip Abraham said of his team, which doesn't have a starter taller than 
5-10. 
</P>
<P>
Edison (10-2) broke the game open in the third quarter, outscoring the Seahawks 
18-8 to take a 45-36 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The key to the surge was Edison's switch from man-to-man defense to a sagging 
zone. While the Chargers' were in man-to-man, Sullivan hit five of nine shots 
for 11 first-half points. 
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter, however, Edison's tiny but mobile zone frustrated 
Sullivan, limiting her to two points on one-of-seven shooting. She finished 
with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
"Our other people didn't respond like they have previously when people keyed on 
Jenny," Ocean View Coach Ollie Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Allie Takido was one of four from the field for Ocean View (13-1), 
and Tracy Wolfe took only one shot and missed it in the decisive quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Edison had been cold, shooting only 37% in the first half. But in the third 
quarter the Chargers got their transition game going and hit on eight of 16 
field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Edison also thwarted Ocean View's press and controlled the boards, thanks to 
Laura Vinch (5-8) and Talia Crooks (5-9). 
</P>
<P>
"Talia has averaged in double figures in points and rebounds for us," Abraham 
said. "Debbie Fischer (the tournament's most valuable player) has been stealing 
the limelight, but Talia is the reason we are able to play teams with big 
posts. 
</P>
<P>
"We have the luxury of having five people who can run the lanes." 
</P>
<P>
The pace wore down Ocean View, which usually looks forward to a footrace. 
</P>
<P>
"We couldn't quite keep up today," Martin said. "Edison played really well. 
They hit a lot of shots, rebounded well. We seemed a little tired at times." 
</P>
<P>
For the third game in a row, the Chargers received balanced scoring, with Erika 
Miller leading the way with 18 points. Three-point specialist Fischer had only 
two three-pointers but finished with 14 points. Crooks added 12 and Vinch 10. 
</P>
<P>
Abraham, who was named the coach of the tournament, said the victory is his 
biggest in his first year as head coach and establishes his program as a 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a real big win," he said. "It makes a lot of our kids realize they're a 
good team. We're a real good team, even though we're not ranked. We beat a 
solid, good team. It feels real good to beat an Ocean View team." 
</P>
<P>
In other Marina tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
Loara 42, Fountain Valley 37 -- Center Traci Titus led Loara (6-7) to a 
fifth-place victory with 19 points. Jennifer Barbaro led Fountain Valley (9-5) 
with 14 points. 
</P>
<P>
La Quinta 71, Marina 63 -- Amy Jalewalia, the tournament's leading scorer with 
122 points, scored 32 to lead La Quinta (8-2) to the consolation championship. 
Melissa Sortino, who had 100 points in four games, scored 26 for Marina (10-4). 
</P>
<P>
Mission Viejo 54, Valencia 48 -- Carrie Burt scored 17 and Jennifer Rohrig 
added 13 to lead the Diablos (10-4) in the seventh-place game. Hollie Keeton 
had 13 and Cathryn Sweet and Sig Lo 12 each for Valencia (5-6). 
</P>
<P>
Foothill 50, Huntington Beach 38 -- Melisa Wielandt scored 14 and Shannon Ebert 
added 13 for Foothill (4-7), which finished 11th. Dana Jahr and Amber Ambrose 
each scored 12 for the Oilers (4-8). DONNA CARTER

Gary Stevens had a message for outrider Linda Baze pulling up after the 
$107,400 Palos Verdes Handicap Saturday at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I've ever gone that fast before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Stevens was right. Sunny Blossom, his companion in the Grade III sprint, 
bettered Chinook Pass' seven-year-old track record for six furlongs with a 1:07 
1/5 clocking in upsetting Olympic Prospect and Sam Who. The Sunny Clime 
gelding's time was two fifths of a second faster than Chinook Pass had gone in 
winning the 1982 Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
Second to Olympic Prospect in a Dec. 3 allowance race at Hollywood Park, Sunny 
Blossom got the edge on the 11-10 favorite out of the gate and that basically 
was the difference. 
</P>
<P>
"I was prepared to sit off Olympic Prospect, but my horse was a length and a 
half in front after the first jump," said Stevens, who has won this race four 
consecutive times. 
</P>
<P>
"My strategy changed right away. My horse was running fast fractions (:21 2/5 
for the quarter and :43 2/5 for the half-mile), but he was doing it awfully 
easy. When I asked him at the top of the stretch, he gave me everything he had.

"I was pretty sure he was close to the track record, if he hadn't broken it. He 
was real anxious in the gate (on Dec. 3) and didn't get off to a good start, 
but he was a perfect gentleman in there today." 
</P>
<P>
Trainer Ed Gregson said a lot of time had been spent working with Sunny Blossom 
in the gate since his last race. The work paid dividends as the 5-1 third 
choice won for the seventh time in 23 starts. 
</P>
<P>
"He's been real tense in the gate," Gregson said. "Gary got him out of there 
today. Half the race was over at the break. 
</P>
<P>
"He'd been breaking off-stride and on the left lead. He was losing too much at 
the start." 
</P>
<P>
Olympic Prospect had overcome a poor beginning and the rail in taking the 
National Sprint Championship two weeks earlier at Hollywood Park, but he was 
never closer than a length to the winner Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
"He broke a little bit better today than last time," Alex Solis said. "Any time 
he gets the (rail) he moves around a lot in there because he has to wait a long 
time. Plus, he was giving eight pounds to the winner. 
</P>
<P>
"But, he ran well. The other horse broke the track record." 
</P>
<P>
Sam Who, the 6-5 second choice, was a distant third, beaten just over seven 
lengths. He was close enough early, but had no rally late. Reconnoitering, 
Cutter Sam and Order completed the field. 
</P>
<P>
"The way the race shaped up, it was perfect for him," Laffit Pincay said of Sam 
Who. "But, I think (trainer) Henry (Moreno) was right. He's not at his best 
now. He made a nice move at the turn, and suddenly I had no horse. He must be 
tailing off because that wasn't his race." 
</P>
<P>
In the paddock before Saturday's fifth race, Gary Jones was somewhat concerned 
about Quiet American's appearance. 
</P>
<P>
"He's a little bit light and his hair's a little dull," the trainer said. 
</P>
<P>
Obviously, in this case, looks were deceiving. Two days before his fourth 
birthday, the son of Fappiano ran himself into the Charles H. Strub Stakes 
picture with an impressive victory over seven allowance rivals. 
</P>
<P>
Winless in three starts in England earlier this year, Quiet American has found 
a home in the United States on the main track. He won his local debut Nov. 15 
at Hollywood Park and had a series of sharp works in preparation for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
Cruising down the backstretch under Chris McCarron after being a bit rank 
early, Quiet American took over from pacesetter El Gran Sid into the stretch 
and drew away. The final margin was six and a half lengths and he completed the 
1 1/16 miles in 1:41 with a final sixteenth in a sparkling six seconds. He then 
galloped out 1 1/8 miles in 1:47. 
</P>
<P>
"He's the best horse I've had my hands on since Turkoman," Jones said. "They 
sent him over here because he hadn't shown anything. They wanted to get rid of 
him. He just didn't like the grass, although I'm not saying he wouldn't handle 
firm turf. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll have to see how he comes out of the race. The San Fernando (Jan. 14) 
would be the right prep (for the Feb. 4 Strub) because he needs the seasoning." 
</P>
<P>
Quiet American's imposing win continued a promising week for McCarron. He had 
earlier won with a pair of talented, soon-to-be 3-year-olds -- Tsu's Dawning 
Thursday and Tarascon Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"They all do have the potential to go on," he said. "Quiet American won very 
easily. I only got after him in the last eighth of a mile and he finished out 
real well. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Prepping for his 4-year-old debut in the San Fernando, Prized worked six 
furlongs in 1:14 2/5 Saturday morning for Neil Drysdale. The son of Kris S. has 
been idle since winning the Breeders' Cup Turf in his first start on the grass. 
Gorgeous, the Breeders' Cup Distaff runner-up, also worked the distance for 
Drysdale, finishing in 1:14 1/5. She'll make her 1990 bow in the $100,000 El 
Encino Handicap Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
Champagne N Jules, the second-longest shot on the board locally, won the 
California Juvenile Stakes, which was simulcast from Bay Meadows. He paid 
$146.60 and combined with 25-1 shot Khal On The Irish for a $3,022.50 exacta. . 
. . Sunny Blossom paid $12.60 to win and earned $62,400 for owners Marty Bauer, 
Robert Estrin, Richard Kessler and Dan Kenny. . . . Payant will make his first 
start since winning the Del Mar Invitational Handicap against nine rivals in 
the $112,700 San Gabriel Handicap today. Others entered in the 1 1/8-mile grass 
race are Patchy Groundfog, In Extremis, Wretham, Delegant, Bosphorus, River 
Warden, Prince Ruffian, Just As Lucky and King Mab. . . . Gary Stevens' other 
three Palos Verdes successes came with Bedside Promise, High Brite and On The 
Line.

Suffolk Downs officials announced Saturday that racing had come to an apparent 
end at the troubled horse track, as they decided to cancel the races scheduled 
today, the final day of the track's license. 
</P>
<P>
The track's business has declined for many months, and track officials had said 
earlier that Dec. 31 would be the closing date.

MORNINGSIDE GIRLS' NO. 1 HOPES FADE WITH 2ND LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
High expectations are always the hardest to live up to. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside High's girls basketball team realizes that now. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Monarchs opened the season ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. 
But after losses to Brea-Olinda and Cannon County of Tennessee in tournaments, 
Morningside's dream of a mythical national title appears in jeopardy, to say 
the least. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside most likely saw its hopes dashed Thursday when Cannon County handed 
the Lady Monarchs a sobering 72-43 loss in the semifinals of the Best of the 
U.S. Invitational tournament in Shelbyville, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
Cannon County, unranked by USA Today, then fell to defending national champion 
and No. 5-ranked Shelbyville, 72-48, in the finals Friday. 
</P>
<P>
Where does that leave Morningside? Considering that a representive of USA Today 
reportedly attended the tournament, it's safe to say the Lady Monarchs will 
drop from their present position of No. 6; perhaps out of the Top 25. 
</P>
<P>
It's been a rough two weeks on the road for the Lady Monarchs. First they lost 
to Brea-Olinda in the Tournament of Champions in Santa Barbara. Then they 
suffered one of their worst losses ever under Coach Frank Scott to Cannon 
County. 
</P>
<P>
An ankle injury that greatly limited the playing time of 6-foot-4 sophomore 
Janet Davis, Morningside's second-best player, didn't help. As the team 
discovered, 6-5 Lisa Leslie can't do it alone. 
</P>
<P>
But the Lady Monarchs' season is hardly over. 
</P>
<P>
They return home this week and open Ocean League play at 3 p.m. Wednesday with 
an important game against North Torrance, led by 5-11 UCLA recruit Laura 
Collins, perhaps the only player in the area who can match up with Leslie. 
</P>
<P>
Morningside has won seven consecutive league titles and owns a 72-game league 
winning streak. The team has reached the California Division I finals each of 
the last two years, winning the title last season. 
</P>
<P>
A national championship may be out of reach, but there are still plenty of 
honors to play for in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
Narbonne's basketball team continued its remarkable turnaround Friday night by 
routing Leuzinger, 73-47, in the championship game of the Torrance Holiday 
Classic at North Torrance High. 
</P>
<P>
Point guard Gabriel Maciel led the way with 20 points, seven assists and four 
steals to earn the Most Valuable Player award. But, as Coach Bob Hoppes likes 
to point out, this is not a one-man team. 
</P>
<P>
Forwards Major Goulsby (20 points, 10 rebounds) and Curtis Boyer (12 points, 10 
rebounds, four blocked shots) were both named all-tournament, and guard D'Mitri 
Rideout (17 points) contributed the game's most dramatic shot when he sank a 
three-pointer at the third-quarter buzzer to give Narbonne a 58-38 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"They all work so very hard," Hoppes said of his players. "Our sixth man 
(forward Vijay Mani) is just as important as any of the five starters." 
</P>
<P>
The Gauchos, who were 3-18 a year ago, are 11-3 entering conference play on 
Friday. Hoppes said a Narbonne alumnus told him that it's the best start for a 
Narbonne basketball team since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
Is Hoppes surprised by the team's record? 
</P>
<P>
"I'd be lying if I said I wasn't," he said. "I knew I had a good basketball 
team, but they had to learn how to win. Team unity has been important. They're 
a very close group." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger (6-2) has now suffered both its losses in the finals of tournaments. 
Last week, the Olympians lost to Bishop Montgomery, 57-49, in the championship 
game of the El Segundo Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't have that many big-game players," Coach Phil Sherman said. "It 
happens every time we have a big game. We're a lot better than we played today. 
We just don't play smart. We're not a smart team right now." 
</P>
<P>
Leuzinger led Narbonne, 21-15, after the first quarter but was blown out in the 
next two quarters, 43-17. Switching to a 1-3-1 zone defense helped the Gauchos 
in the second quarter, when they shut out Leuzinger's leading scorer, Adrian 
McCovey. The 6-5 senior had 10 points in the first quarter and finished with 20 
to earn all-tournament honors. 
</P>
<P>
"We had to stop their shooter (McCovey)," Hoppes said. 
</P>
<P>
Strangely, Leuzinger's 6-8 junior center, Frank Willis, was never a factor in 
the game. He had five points, three coming in the waning minutes. 
</P>
<P>
"In the last three games," Sherman said. "he's been absent." 
</P>
<P>
Morningside, The Times' top-ranked South Bay basketball team, suffered its 
second loss of the season Friday to Bonanza High of Las Vegas, 77-76, in the 
semifinals of the Viking Classic in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
The Monarchs had a chance to take a three-point lead with 19 seconds left, but 
forward Tyrone Paul missed two free throws. Bonanza came down and scored the 
game-winner on a offensive rebound by Jamal Willis with six seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Bonanza, which met Carson in the final Saturday night, is ranked No. 2 in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Redondo's basketball team, off to a 2-9 start, is looking to the future. The 
Sea Hawks are starting three sophomores and one junior, and their first two 
players off the bench are juniors. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Steve Shaw is high on 6-4 sophomores Dave Cottey and Ryan Turner and 
junior guard Jason Correa, who helped Redondo reach the consolation final of 
the Nogales Tournament this week and was named all-tournament. 
</P>
<P>
A sprained ankle sidelined 6-6 sophomore Art Shell for nearly all of Palos 
Verdes' four games in the Chino Tournament this week, but Coach John 
Mihaljevich hopes Shell will be ready for Wednesday night's Bay League opener 
against Hawthorne at Palos Verdes.

1985 
</P>
<P>
Canyon High extended its football winning streak to 38 games and Donna Duke 
extended the imagination by making 12 holes-in-one. 
</P>
<P>
. . . and the streak went on. 
</P>
<P>
Going into the 1985 football season, Canyon High had won 24 games in a row. At 
season's end, the Cowboys had tacked on 14 more wins without a loss. Canyon 
Country finished its second consecutive perfect season by edging Antelope 
Valley, 9-7, in the Southern Section Northwestern Conference title game. 
</P>
<P>
But it wasn't pretty. The Cowboys, who had been averaging 32 points a game, 
fumbled five times, missed a conversion and didn't play well on offense against 
a team they had beaten, 30-6, four weeks before. 
</P>
<P>
Antelope Valley had only 145 yards in total offense and never got inside 
Canyon's 20 but still had a chance at a major upset because of a fourth-quarter 
blunder. A snap on a punt went over the head of Canyon punter Randy Austin. 
Austin, the team's star tight end and linebacker, ran down the football and 
tried to pass, but the ball landed in the hands of Antelope Valley's James 
Richards, who rambled 20 yards for a touchdown with 2:41 left. 
</P>
<P>
"That was our best offensive play of the game," cracked Antelope Valley Coach 
Brent Newcomb. 
</P>
<P>
The Cowboys recovered an onside kick to preserve the win -- and the streak. 
"The team is 38-0," Welch said. "They've won in the rain. They've won in the 
heat. They've won in Central California and they've won here. They're 38-0. Who 
else can say that?" 
</P>
<P>
She will be a topic of discussion at the 19th hole for years. 
</P>
<P>
With an ace on the 18th hole of the Clark Golf Course at the Pt. Mugu Naval Air 
Base on July 26, Donna Duke of Camarillo set a world record by making 12 
hole-in-ones in the span of one year. 
</P>
<P>
Duke's hole-in-one broke a 23-year record of 11 by Dr. Boyd Stone of 
Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that Duke had 28 witnesses to the 12 hole-in-ones, Golf Digest 
magazine, which verifies golf records, refused to certify her record. 
</P>
<P>
Duke, 54, a retired civil service worker, made 20 hole-in-ones from Sept. 22, 
1984, to Oct. 24, 1986. 
</P>
<P>
The Lady Matador softball team, behind pitcher Kathy Slaten, defeated Akron to 
win its third consecutive NCAA Division II title. Slaten, a junior, was 41-11 
and had 533 strikeouts in 410 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
She finished her career the following season as a four-time Division II 
All-American and three-time Division II Player of the Year. Slaten's career 
record at CSUN was 133-33-1 and she allowed only 41 earned runs in 1,221 2/3 
innings -- a 0.23 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
In her CSUN career, she had 97 shutouts and 1,537 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
Notable: The CSUN women's volleyball team reached the NCAA Division II final 
for the second consecutive year but lost -- for the second consecutive year -- 
to Portland State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
More than nine years and 97 matches after it began, the Pierce College winning 
streak in Metropolitan Conference tennis matches came to an end in a 5-1 loss 
to Harbor. The Brahmas won their first Ojai tournament title, however, which 
was a special treat for Coach Paul Xanthos, who played in the tournament as a 
Los Angeles City College freshman in 1939. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Despite being limited to only one full scholarship, the CSUN men's swimming 
team won its fifth consecutive NCAA Division II championship and ninth in 11 
years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Tom Keele, the football coach at Cal State Northridge, was axed after a 4-7 
season that included a 61-24 season-ending loss to Portland State. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Middleweight Michael Nunn made his professional debut in the Valley an 
auspicious one by knocking out Robert Jackson in 72 seconds of the first round 
at the Reseda Country Club. . . .JEFF MEYERS

1984 
</P>
<P>
Led by skier Billy Johnson, gymnast Mitch Gaylord and pole vaulter Mike Tully, 
several Valley athletes fulfilled Olympic dreams. 
</P>
<P>
The Valley area became America's ski capital, thanks to a 23-year old former 
car thief from Van Nuys. His name: Billy Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson, who as a teen-ager was told by an Oregon judge to either shape up or 
face reform school, became the first American man to capture an Olympic gold 
medal on snow. He defeated Peter Mueller of Switzerland by 27/100ths of a 
second on Bjelasnica Mountain in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, to win the men's 
downhill. 
</P>
<P>
No American male had finished better than 10th in the downhill before Johnson, 
or "Wild Bill" as he was known, brashly predicted an upset victory, then 
proceeded to pull it off. 
</P>
<P>
"I wanted it more than anybody else," said Johnson, who covered the almost 
two-mile course in an average speed of 65.3 m. p. h. And when an Austrian 
television reporter suggested that his victory had come over a relatively easy 
course, Johnson, in typically candid fashion, replied: "If it was so easy, then 
why didn't (the Austrians) win?" 
</P>
<P>
Johnson wasn't the only Valley-area athlete to create a stir during the winter 
sports season. 
</P>
<P>
Tiffany Chin, a 4-foot-8 16-year-old from Toluca Lake won the U. S. women's 
free skating crown, upsetting Rosalynn Sumners, the two-time defending 
champion. In the Olympics, Chin placed fourth overall in women's figure 
skating. 
</P>
<P>
Judy Blumberg, 26, from Tarzana, teamed with partner Michael Seibert to place 
fourth in Olympic ice dancing. 
</P>
<P>
In the summer Olympics, Mitch Gaylord, a 1979 graduate of Grant High, helped 
the U. S. men's gymnastics team win its first gold medal in the team 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
In track and field, Mike Tully of Encino won an Olympic silver medal in the 
pole vault after he set an American record of 19 feet, 1 inch in the Trials. 
Former Cal State Northridge star Alice Brown won a silver medal in the women's 
100 meters and led off the gold-medal winning 400-meter relay, and Dave Laut, a 
former Moorpark College standout, earned a medal in the shot put. His effort of 
68-9 3/4 won the bronze. 
</P>
<P>
In baseball, Cal State Northridge came through the losers' bracket and defeated 
Florida Southern, 10-5, to win the Division II World Series. 
</P>
<P>
Perry Husband, Northridge's senior second baseman, was the most valuable player 
in the Series, going 13 for 28 and scoring 16 runs. Jim Walker pitched a 
four-hitter, striking out eight in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
Northridge finished the season with a 46-21-1 record and Coach Bob Hiegert 
resigned after the season to devote more time to his job as CSUN athletic 
director. 
</P>
<P>
Notable: Joe Hillman, a Hoover High guard, averaged 41.3 points a game during 
his senior season to finish with 2,213 points, eighth-best on the Southern 
Section career list. 
</P>
<P>
Hillman was the first player west of the Mississippi River to be recruited by 
Indiana Coach Bob Knight. He played a key role on the Hoosiers' 1987 national 
championship team and was voted Big Ten Conference Player of the Year in 1988. 
. . . 
</P>
<P>
It was a banner year, literally, for local high school football teams, which 
won four Southern Section titles, an all-time high. The champions: Camarillo in 
the Coastal Conference, Canyon in the Northwestern Conference, Agoura in the 
Desert-Mountain Conference, and Faith Baptist in the Eight-Man Large Schools 
Division. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Aaron Emanuel of Quartz Hill was the Southern Section Division II Player of the 
Year. He was the top-rated high school rusher in the nation and his 4,807 
career yards is seventh on the Southern Section all-time list. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Valley College guard Larry Middleton led the state in scoring with a 
28-points-a-game average and was chosen an All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Cliff Higgins, probably the best basketball player in Cal State Northridge 
history, closed out his career by averaging 19.2 points and earning California 
Collegiate Athletic Assn. Player of the Year for the second consecutive season. 
Higgins, who went on to play for the Golden State Warriors, was a Division II 
All-American. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Northridge men's teams won two national championships. In swimming, the 
Matadors won their eighth Division II title and fourth in a row, and Kevin 
O'Neil was selected the meet's outstanding athlete. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Led by pitcher Jack McDowell (9-0 record), Notre Dame High spent much of the 
baseball season rated No. 1 among high schools in the nation. The Knights lost 
to Millikan, 5-0, in the Southern Section quarterfinals to finish with a 27-1 
record. McDowell, whose brother Jim was coach at Notre Dame, went on to pitch 
Stanford to the national championship in 1987. . . . MIKE HISERMAN

1987 
</P>
<P>
Jan was dean of the City 4-A football final and the John Clark five from Saugus 
High won an improbable Southern Section basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
As wide receiver Kyle Jan walked onto the field at East L. A. College with his 
Granada Hills High football teammates, he confidently mentioned to a bystander 
that the Highlanders had the City Section 4-A Division championship in the bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills was playing heavily favored Carson, which entered the game with 
an 11-0 record and a No. 2 national ranking by USA Today. Furthermore, the 
Colts already had beaten the Highlanders, 42-14, in the regular season and 
56-14 in the semifinals the season before. 
</P>
<P>
Was Jan popping off? No, more like bursting Carson's bubble. Before the game 
was over, Jan was named the most valuable player by Prime Ticket after leading 
the Highlanders to a 27-14 upset, giving the Valley its only City 4-A football 
title of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
Jan caught seven passes from quarterback Jeremy Leach for a game-high 93 yards 
and a touchdown. While playing defensive back, he intercepted two passes by 
ambidextrous Carson quarterback George Malauulu. He also set the stands ablaze 
with his off-field tactics -- not that he was out of the game all that often. 
</P>
<P>
While on the sidelines, Jan ran up the tartan track that encircles the field, 
waving his arms to fire up the fans. "He was definitely into it," said Leach, 
now a starter at New Mexico who played the championship game in a pair of 
borrowed high-top shoes. "He went nuts." 
</P>
<P>
He drove Malauulu nuts too. Jan, who finished the season with 65 receptions for 
950 yards and 15 touchdowns, intercepted a Malauulu pass to end a drive in the 
third quarter and another with 6:44 to play. Maybe Jan was practicing for his 
collegiate career: Jan and Malauulu are now teammates at Arizona. Of course, 
now Malauulu intends for Jan to catch the ball. 
</P>
<P>
How big was the upset? Well, the Highlanders -- who finished 9-3 after a 2-3 
start -- were a team that even a mother couldn't love. 
</P>
<P>
"I overheard my mom say before the game that she wouldn't bet on us," Leach 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Improbable. Unlikely. Unpredictable. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, even the coach was caught up in the barrage of adjectives. 
</P>
<P>
"Unbelievable is probably a better word," Saugus Coach John Clark admitted. 
</P>
<P>
Headline writers all over town ran out of adjectives long before the Saugus 
basketball team ran out of juice. 
</P>
<P>
Saugus, which entered the Southern Section 3-A playoffs as a wild-card team, 
reeled off win after win to become only the second team in Section history to 
win a title as a wild-card entry. 
</P>
<P>
The Centurions' title script was indeed unbelievable. Before each game, Clark 
showed his players videotapes of David-and-Goliath movie fare such as "Top 
Gun," "Rocky," "Victory" and "Hoosiers." 
</P>
<P>
Led by senior forward Rusty Morse, who averaged 18 points a game, Saugus beat 
cross-town rival Hart in a wild-card game, then scored victories against 
second-seeded Katella, California, Tustin, Palos Verdes and Rolling Hills in 
the final. Rolling Hills, the top-seeded team, was riding a 16-game win streak. 
</P>
<P>
It didn't end there. The Centurions -- who finished 23-10 -- advanced to the 
state playoffs and came within a game of the final before losing to Woodbridge 
and Stanford-bound center Adam Keefe. 
</P>
<P>
Anybody for unconscious? 
</P>
<P>
The illustrious career of quarterback Tom Bonds ended and, for practical 
purposes, Cal Lutheran's experiment with Division II football ended with it. 
</P>
<P>
The 5-foot-10 three-time NAIA All-American was the only reason the school could 
compete in the Western Football Conference. As a sophomore, Bonds passed for 
2,427 yards and led CLU to a 6-5 record in its first year in Division II. As a 
junior, he set NAIA and NCAA Division II records with 44 completions and 434 
yards passing in a game. 
</P>
<P>
Cal Lutheran had undersized linemen and virtually a nonexistent running game, 
leaving Bonds as the lone threat. Still, he finished sixth on the Division II 
career passing yardage list with 7,773 and set six WFC records. 
</P>
<P>
Bonds passed for more than 10,000 yards for Valley teams. He led Hart High to 
the 1983 Coastal Conference championship in his senior year. 
</P>
<P>
Notable: Thousand Oaks High won the Coastal Conference football championship 
behind the running of Marc Monestime, who rushed for 1,596 yards and set a 
Ventura County career rushing mark with 3,984 yards. 
</P>
<P>
It was the first Southern Section football title for the Lancers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Pitcher-shortstop Jeff Cirillo of tiny Providence High tied a single-season 
Southern Section record with 57 hits. Cirillo now plays at USC. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Kubiak of Cal State Northridge won his seventh individual NCAA Division II 
national swimming championship. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Denise Sitton of Cal State Northridge became the school's all-time leading 
scorer in women's basketball with 1,467 points. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Quincy Watts, a Taft High junior, won state championships in the 100 (10.49) 
and the 200 (20.99) and Dave Bultman of Royal won state titles in the shot put 
(67-0) and discus (193-6). Watts' victories capped an undefeated season against 
high school competition. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The Cal State Northridge softball team continued its domination under Coach 
Gary Torgeson by winning its fourth NCAA Division II championship in the past 
five years with a 4-0 victory over Florida Southern. STEVE ELLING

1988 
</P>
<P>
Middleweight Michael Nunn and the Monroe High baseball team rose from obscurity 
to become champions and CS Northridge also took a huge step. 
</P>
<P>
As North Hollywood boxer Michael Nunn fought his way through the middleweight 
ranks toward a title shot, criticism of his light-hitting style accompanied his 
ascent. Nunn kept his record perfect but his failure to deliver a knockout 
punch frustrated his supporters and provided ammunition for his critics. 
</P>
<P>
But the 6-foot-2 southpaw silenced many of his critics with a big year in 1988. 
He scored five victories during the year, including four by knockout. After 
three defenses of his North American Boxing Federation title, he earned an 
International Boxing Federation title fight against unbeaten Frank Tate. He 
started the year fighting at the tiny Country Club in Reseda but by year's end 
was a Las Vegas regular at Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
It was in Las Vegas that Nunn put himself in the national limelight with a 
ninth-round knockout of Tate. The victory earned him $125,000 and increased his 
record to 31-0 with 21 knockouts. In November, Nunn defended his world title 
with his fourth knockout of the year when he floored Juan Domingo Roldan in the 
eighth round of their bout in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
Monroe High squeaked into the City Section 4-A baseball playoffs as the 
fourth-place team from the Mid-Valley League with a 5-10 league mark (9-16 
overall). In fact, the Vikings had to defeat Birmingham in a tiebreaker to 
advance to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings seemed primed to serve as fodder for such traditional powers as 
Chatsworth, which entered the tournament as the No. 1 team in the nation. But 
Chatsworth lost in the semifinals and when the City championship was presented 
at Dodger Stadium in June, the unlikely new champion was Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings registered three consecutive upsets -- two in extra innings -- and 
then defeated San Fernando in the final, 3-2. In five postseason games, junior 
Tim Costic was 12 for 20 with 11 runs batted in and five extra-base hits. Three 
times he drove home the winning run in Monroe's last at-bat. As a pitcher, he 
also won two games and saved another. 
</P>
<P>
Despite formidable questions over funding, Cal State Northridge announced its 
intention to petition the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. for a move up to 
Division I in all sports except football for the 1990-91 school year. 
</P>
<P>
Through the 1988 school year, the Matadors had won 33 national championships in 
12 sports over three decades at the Division II level. The school cited 
overwhelming community support as a primary factor in the decision, but that 
support apparently came with few dollar signs in tow. 
</P>
<P>
Plans outlined by President James W. Cleary called for the construction of an 
8,000- to 10,000-seat arena, and plans for a 20,000-seat multipurpose stadium 
had been approved. In order to field competitive teams, the annual price tag 
for the move will be $1.3 million, according to school sources. Previously, the 
most money CSUN had raised in a year was $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
Notable: In a 41-21 loss to Servite in which he rushed for 162 yards, Crespi 
High's Russell White ended his three-year varsity career as the state's 
all-time leading rusher with 5,998 yards. He also scored three touchdowns to 
push his state records to 94 touchdowns and 568 points scored. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In the same week, two of the area's top high school athletes committed to 
Pacific 10 Conference schools. Taft High's Quincy Watts, who won three 
individual state track titles, committed to USC four days before Don MacLean, 
who led Simi Valley to the Southern Section 4-A Division basketball 
championship, committed to UCLA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Butler, who has joined MacLean at UCLA, led tiny Oakwood School to its 
first Southern Section title in any sport when the Gorillas defeated Hesperia 
Christian, 61-60, in the Small Schools final. In the quarterfinals, he scored 
50 points in a 55-47 win over Ribet Christian. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Scott Sharts ended his three-year baseball career at Simi Valley as the 
Southern Section's all-time home run leader with 32. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Royal won the Southern Section 4-A boys' soccer title and Agoura won its third 
consecutive Southern Section girls' soccer title with a 5-0 victory over Temple 
City. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Junior Angela Burnham of Rio Mesa High won the 100 and 200 in the state track 
and field championships to lead the Spartans to a share of the girls' team 
title with Bakersfield. Burnham ran a national age-16 record of 11.28 in the 
100 in the Olympic Trials later in the summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
In front of the largest crowd to see a CSUN soccer match, the Matadors fell to 
Florida Institute of Technology, 3-2, in the National Collegiate Athletic Assn. 
Division II final. As runner-up, the Matadors matched their 1987 performance in 
what was supposed to be a rebuilding year for Coach Marwan Ass'ad's program. . 
. . 
</P>
<P>
CSUN volleyball Coach Walt Ker won his 300th career match to reach the NCAA 
Division II tournament. The Matadors reached the final but lost to Portland 
State in three games. . . . 
</P>

EUROPE TAKES CENTER STAGE AS SOVIET EMPIRE COLLAPSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Thomas Powers, Thomas Powers is a contributing editor to Opinion. His most 
recent book is a collection of essays, Thinking About the Next War (Knopf).

<TEXT>
<P>
Easily said, still hard to believe: The Soviet empire came to an end in 1989. 
History never came wrapped in a neater package. 
</P>
<P>
In 1980, the will of the people found voice in the shipyards of Gdansk, Poland. 
Outlawed and driven underground, the movement only gathered strength. Last 
year, it stepped into the void left by the Polish Communist Party. Before 
year's end, the power of this example swept four other Communist parties out of 
power, stranding Soviet armies in a Europe they could no longer hope to 
control. 
</P>
<P>
All sorts of trouble may lie ahead but there is no going back. Three times in 
the course of their 40-year occupation, Soviet armies put down popular 
revolutions in Eastern Europe -- in East Germany in 1953, in Hungary in 1956, 
in Czechoslovakia in 1968. Each episode sparked an international political 
crisis. An attempt to repeat suppression -- simultaneously in five countries -- 
would be indistinguishable from general war. As a result, several things end 
with the '80s: Moscow's rule in Eastern Europe, communism as a political 
movement, the balance of power established after Germany's defeat in 1945 and 
the fear of Soviet expansionism that sustained the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
It is so hard to exaggerate the political significance of these events. They 
place 1989 on a level with 1917, 1848 and 1789. But the full meaning of those 
years is in what followed, not in what ended; this will also be true now. As 
Niels Bohr used to say, "It is very hard to predict, especially about the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
Yet certain things seem likely. The first is Europe's return to center stage in 
international politics. Not only the Soviet Union will recede to the wings, but 
the United States as well. We aren't rich enough to pay for the reconstruction 
of Eastern Europe, and we are no longer irreplaceable in defense of the West. 
Europeans will be polite about it, but there will be some painful adjustments 
in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
Second will be the re-emergence of a confident, powerful, united Germany. 
Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Bulgaria are now the orphans of 
Europe. No one is responsible for financing their recovery after 40 years of 
economic stagnation. They will have to beg for help where they can find it. 
Only East Germany will have a powerful patron. 
</P>
<P>
The combination of a growing economy and return of the German capital to Berlin 
-- what better concession can the West make to the pride of the East? -- will 
make Germany first among equals in Europe. With luck, this will evolve slowly, 
but it is bound to happen. The peace of the world for the next generation 
depends on the grace and sure-footedness with which the rest of Europe allows 
it to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
Yet one question looms largest: How will the Soviet Union respond to 
simultaneous losses of empire and political faith while the economy grinds ever 
deeper into paralysis? Will collapse of the Soviet empire be followed by 
collapse of the Russian empire -- that vast stretch of Asian peoples, 11 
time-zones wide, put together by czars in the 19th Century? At the moment, 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev himself seems to be the center of gravity holding the 
pieces together. The whole world -- not just Russians -- would do well to tell 
themselves: apres lui, le deluge.

PICKING THE PERFECT, INCORRUPTIBLE POLITICIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ed Davis, Ed Davis, a state senator (R-Santa Clarita), was the Los Angeles 
police chief from 1969 to 1978. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To put current charges of Los Angeles political corruption in perspective, 
consider the picture more than five decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
When I was in my teens my great ambition was to become a Los Angeles police 
officer. I had known officers and admired them. 
</P>
<P>
Then the image of the police department -- and local politicians -- came into 
question. A great upheaval happened in Los Angeles, following discoveries by a 
brave man, Clifford Clinton. He was researching corruption in local government, 
having hired -- and paid for -- a private investigator. The investigator's car 
was bombed; the culprit turned out to be a police captain, Earl E. Kynette, who 
was convicted and sent to San Quentin. 
</P>
<P>
More scandals followed, revealing mammoth political corruption in Los Angeles. 
Superior Court Judge Fletcher Bowron, in charge of the Grand Jury, looked into 
the police department to discover that hirings and promotions were based on 
bribery. 
</P>
<P>
Police Captain Peter Delgado was charged and indicted. While on bail he escaped 
to Mexico and later ran a resort hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The brother of Mayor Frank Shaw and several people working with him carried 
corruption into City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The climax was a recall election. Old guard out; new brooms in. Fletcher Bowron 
became mayor and Los Angeles has enjoyed an essentially incorruptible city 
government since. 
</P>
<P>
Looking at the current criticism of Mayor Tom Bradley and other city officials, 
anyone who remembers the past may realize that the transgressions by my old 
Police Academy classmate are relatively minor compared with what we saw 50 
years ago. I am not defending Tom -- he has admitted having made mistakes -- 
but in long perspective we can be generally proud of the cleanliness of local 
government, in this city and this state. 
</P>
<P>
When I was chief of police, my officers felt the biggest problem in the 
department was the quality of sergeants. I would smile and say our sergeants 
certainly aren't perfect, but I had a problem: Sergeants are selected from the 
ranks of policemen. I think the same thing applies for the '90s in the 
selection of politicians -- whether mayors, legislators, governors or 
Presidents. We must select our politicians from among the citizens of our 
society. We will never get perfect politicians until we have perfect citizens. 
We can continue to fine-tune politics with ethical reforms and make 
improvements, but at the same time we should recognize having the best example 
of democracy in history and celebrate the quality of public servants selected 
over the last two centuries.

1989: FOUR POLITICAL FIXTURES SUFFER HARDS TIMES AND BAD CALLS ; 
</P>
<P>
RUNNING INTO TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tom Bradley, 72, was the loneliest and strongest of long-distance runners, the 
student from South-Central Los Angeles who refused to take shop classes, the 
UCLA track star who became a policeman, lawyer, city councilman and, in 1973, 
mayor of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
Tall, dignified -- even inscrutable -- the first black mayor of a huge 
white-majority city, Bradley won four terms and ran without a tumble. Perhaps 
his finest moments came with the 1984 Olympics, when Bradley pushed the games 
and watched the city turn a profit. 
</P>
<P>
Then came 1989, with a deluge of charges that the mayor offered preferential 
treatment in return for campaign contributions, that he accepted payments from 
a bank while depositing public funds in it, that carnivals were staged 
illegally to raise campaign funds. The city attorney found "insufficient 
evidence" to prosecute. But the public lost faith. The unmaking of a self-made 
man. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky was running hard for mayor until early 1989, 
with big money and a powerful amalgam of liberal groups ready to unseat Tom 
Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
But his own campaign advisers -- company acronym BAD -- helped do him in. BAD 
memos on campaign strategy -- with a hint of elitism, a possible whiff of 
racism -- became public. Yaroslavsky disowned them but the damage was done. 
</P>
<P>
Polls showed voters swinging back to Bradley. Environmentalists who once 
embraced Yaroslavsky looked around to count new projects high-rising on the 
home turf; they began wondering if he was really a developer in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
For 15 years, Yaroslavsky raced smartly, from UCLA activism to City Hall, from 
blue jeans to white collars. Then he stumbled, figured the odds were long and 
went back to the council. The promising young man who said he wanted to save 
the world decided not to go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Alan Cranston, elected to the U.S. Senate for four consecutive terms, stays in 
superb physical shape. At 75, he does morning wind sprints and dines on low-fat 
fish. A senator for forever. 
</P>
<P>
Liberal crusader and master fund-raiser, Cranston is suddenly in rotten 
political shape. He took $47,000 in campaign money and $850,000 more for 
voter-registration groups from Charles H. Keating Jr., the S&amp;L mogul who 
gave millions to both parties until the government seized his insolvent firm. 
Now, Internal Revenue agents investigate the $7 million Cranston raised for 
voter registration. The Keating-related charge: giving special treatment to a 
donor. The IRS-sponsored probe: possible violation of tax-exempt status to play 
partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
The senator denies doing wrong and plans to run again. But 71% of his fellow 
Democrats in California say he should not compete in '90; 38% think he should 
step down right now. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Peter F. Schabarum's peers at the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors know 
him as Pete. In 1989 his enemies were calling him Pedro, when Schabarum 
celebrated his Mexican grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
The one-time triple-threat fullback for UC Berkeley represents more than 1.6 
million citizens, but now he bucks a whole wall of agencies that claim 1981 
district lines were designed to dilute Latino voter strength -- hence, Latino 
representation. The U.S. Justice Department filed suit. Two local activist 
groups joined as plaintiffs. Even a Republican colleague on the board seemed to 
help hobble Schabarum's 1990 reelection chances. 
</P>
<P>
The issue comes to trial this week. While Schabarum says he honors his Mexican 
heritage, some Latinos say he has been their worst enemy. 
</P>
<P>
Schabarum style is neither sweet nor salsa -- more maverick, blunt. His next 
race may depend less on form than on where the playing field is drawn.

WHAT KIND OF SOCIETY KEEPS ITS CHILDREN IN POVERTY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By George Regas, George Regas is the rector of All Saints Church, Pasadena. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We are seeing an extraordinary celebration of freedom in Europe. With 
breathtaking swiftness, we are witnessing the emergence of a new world. As my 
heart thrills to this burst of new life, I am called to assess the state of 
freedom -- and the state of children -- in my own country. 
</P>
<P>
I guarantee you, no East German family in pursuit of liberty would wisely go to 
Main and Fifth streets in Los Angeles. Nothing inhibits expression, action, 
movement and personal freedom more than oppressive and grinding poverty. 
Nothing so impoverishes a person as a deficient education. 
</P>
<P>
Most shocking of all is the way the burden of this poverty makes captives of 
our children. In California, the richest state in the nation, the poor go to 
bed hungry, if they are lucky enough to have a bed. After the staggering 
amounts we spend to defend ourselves externally, there isn't enough left over 
to feed the ones we're defending internally -- to help give them decent 
shelter, decent schools, decent care when they're sick and old. 
</P>
<P>
A serious measure of a society is how it treats its children. By that standard 
America is in deep trouble. The United States may be the first society in 
history where children are worse off than adults. Children are now 40% of the 
nation's poor -- 25% of everyone under the age of 18 lives in poverty. Have we 
created a society that doesn't love children? 
</P>
<P>
W. C. Fields once remarked cynically, "Anyone who hates children and dogs can't 
be all bad." That used to be funny because it wasn't true. But today we have 
created a society where children are abused and neglected, and where the 
"throw-away child" has become a walking social catastrophe in our time. 
</P>
<P>
In June, 1989, California received a grade of D for its services to the state's 
7.6 million children, in a report prepared by Children Now, a nonpartisan group 
of distinguished Californians. 
</P>
<P>
The picture is grim. One out of five children in California lives in poverty. 
Half the state's 2-year-olds have not been fully immunized against 
communicative diseases. 
</P>
<P>
Education is a well-documented disaster, with one-third of all students 
dropping out of high school before graduation -- and for blacks the figure 
reaches 48%, for Latinos, 45%. These bleak figures will worsen when the impact 
of Gov. George Deukmejian's $25-million cut in family-planning services hits 
the families of our state. 
</P>
<P>
What we've allowed to happen to our children is scandalous. It grieves the 
heart of God. A society in which children are the poorest citizens loses every 
claim to greatness. As citizens of this rich state, we can change that if we 
choose. 
</P>
<P>
The Greeks had a saying: "There will be no justice in Athens until the 
uninjured parties are as indignant as the injured parties." In 1990 my deepest 
hope is that we commit ourselves to be advocates for those who have no voice, 
to create a society worthy of our children.

A MORAL ORDER TO PROTECT HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Roger Mahony, Roger Mahony is the archbishop for the Roman Catholic Diocese 
of Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We in Los Angeles need to begin the 1990s asking ourselves how seriously we 
take our personal responsibility to uphold objective morality. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles enters this last decade of the century facing a gridlock of human 
problems not entirely susceptible to human, secular solutions. Most are at root 
moral problems. 
</P>
<P>
The social, economic and political health of the city rests on fidelity to a 
moral order. A truly human society must rest on a bedrock of moral values if 
that society is to endure. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles residents must boldly examine their personal obligation to uphold 
the primacy of objective moral values over subjective whim or personal 
convenience. This obligation means being neither passive about our individual 
consciences nor indifferent to the needs of our neighbor. The moral order 
integrates all human activity and assures tranquility, security, contentment 
and freedom for the fulfillment of human aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
Moral disorder erodes and destroys freedom, victimizes the human person, harms 
the innocent, ruins our fragile environment, jeopardizes the very physical 
safety of citizens, burdens taxpayers -- it addicts and enslaves those given to 
defying moral norms. 
</P>
<P>
One litmus test of a culture is the treatment of children. Are they safe in 
school, on the playground, on neighborhood streets, in the home, even in their 
mother's womb? 
</P>
<P>
Are there not muggers and molesters in society who threaten the very life of 
children, even of the preborn child in its supposedly safest dwelling? 
</P>
<P>
Are adults also not victimized by promoters of pornography, peddlers of drugs, 
organizers of gangs, producers of sleazy entertainment that says infidelity and 
promiscuity are no big deal? What about policies that telegraph to teen-agers 
that immoral sexual activity is to be taken for granted and, in effect, 
condoned? 
</P>
<P>
Upholding moral standards is often denigrated as narrow religious sectarianism, 
but to reject objective morality stemming from the laws of God and nature over 
2,000 years of Judeo-Christian history is also to reject America's own 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
Our Founding Fathers understood that human beings are divinely created and 
because of this are endowed with inalienable rights that come from God -- not 
from a state, a church, a government or any other entity. To protect these 
human rights God established a moral order. To reject it is to jeopardize human 
dignity and freedom, to be untrue to the nature God gave us. 
</P>
<P>
What Los Angeles needs for the 1990s are assertive citizens who are lovers of 
true freedom in the light of moral laws, who can by example inspire others to 
do what is morally true and right, who can in their daily lives and community 
maintain in Southern California a high moral tenor. 
</P>
<P>
Those who live up to the name of our City of the Angels in the coming decade 
will be an effective moral force and the conscience of the community. Together 
we can build a unique city of equal opportunity for all.

WORLD FINANCIAL FORECAST: CLOUDY, CLEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead is the author of Mortal Splendor: 
The American Empire in Transition (Houghton Mifflin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
<P>
NEW YORK 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Budget and trade deficits 
soared -- but so did gross national product. Americans spent more than ever but 
our industry became less competitive. Corporate America went on a debt-financed 
merger spree -- and reported record earnings. The United States enjoyed record 
economic expansion -- and became a debtor nation for the first time since World 
War I. Incomes boomed, homeless filled the streets. 
</P>
<P>
The '80s were a time of economic paradox, not just here, but worldwide. 
Communism failed, capitalism triumphed -- but only if you didn't count the 
Third World. The world economy grew more integrated than ever before but 
protectionism also increased. 
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the '90s? Unsettled and cloudy. The world economy contains the 
seeds of a great boom and a great depression; the '90s could see either or 
both. Technological progress, European integration and rising standards of 
living around the Pacific Rim could bring back the good old 1960s. This was 
when Americans thought average, single-income families could -- and should -- 
own their own homes while watching their standards of living rise every year. 
</P>
<P>
That would be nice, but the world economy is as likely to belly-up as boom. 
International cooperation can help deter trouble but the outlook is complicated 
by current relationships. With U.S. prosperity still dependent on an inflow of 
Japanese capital that many Americans resent, and tensions between the two 
Pacific partners ratcheting up year by year, the United States and Japan could 
waste the 1990s in futile but expensive trade wars. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Western Europe could be too busy picking up the pieces in the East 
to care much about the rest of the world. An isolationist Europe might restrict 
imports from both the United States and Asia. Instead of one dynamic world 
economy, we could end up with three stagnant, quarreling blocs. 
</P>
<P>
One other question mark hovers over the future. In most of the world, the '80s 
were the decade of Thatcherism -- Reaganomics without the tax cuts. The basic 
idea was to make life better for the rich in the belief that this prosperity 
would "trickle down." Maybe. Historians generally (not universally; historians, 
like economists, glory in contradiction) blame 1920s speculation for the Great 
Depression of the '30s. The rich had plenty of money to invest, but the poor 
and middle class had no money to buy. 
</P>
<P>
There was more. International finance resembled a giant Ponzi scheme. Germany 
borrowed from the United States to pay debts to Britain and France. Britain and 
France used their German money to pay U.S. war debt. But when the crash came, 
Americans had no more money for Germany. Without U.S. money, Germany collapsed. 
Without German money, France and Britain could not pay debts. 
</P>
<P>
Some financial historians warn that we are in danger of repeating this dismal 
story, with Japan lending money to the United States so that we can service 
foreign debt -- the largest, fastest-growing debt in the world. If Tokyo stock 
and real-estate markets should falter -- and there are plenty of reasons why 
they should -- Japanese money would dry up overnight. The shock could bring 
down America's banking system, cause a new Great Depression and leave the 
dollar trading one-for-one with the peso. 
</P>
<P>
Oh well. History is not only bunk, the State Department tells us it's over. 
Happy New Year.

LOOKING FOR MR. NADER; 
</P>
<P>
POLITICS: VOTER REVOLT POPULISM IS FINISHED UNLESS THE CONSUMER ADVOCATE BOOSTS 
ITS LATEST BRAINCHILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

It is gospel in California politics that without Ralph Nader's imprimatur, 
Proposition 103 would have lost. Now, more than a year later, the consumer 
advocate is again desperately needed in the fight to reduce auto-insurance 
premiums. But will Nader ride to the rescue? 
</P>
<P>
Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield and his populist Voter Revolt 
organization, fed up with the legal wrangling over implementing his 
voter-approved insurance reform, recently introduced "Son of Proposition 103" 
(as yet the measure has no official title). Under the proposal, all private 
auto insurers would be expelled from California if, by Sept. 1, 1991, average 
insurance rates were not 20% below 1987 levels and if more than 15% of the 
state's motorists were uninsured. A nonprofit state insurance company would 
fill the void. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield and Voter Revolt need to collect a million signatures by May 18 to 
ensure that the measure gets on the November ballot. That's a challenging task 
since both he and fellow reformer Bill Zimmerman couldn't qualify an initiative 
that would have given taxpayers a sizeable rebate by shifting the Proposition 
13 tax burden to business. 
</P>
<P>
Trouble is that Nader has been crusading to limit the number of terms a 
politician can spend in Congress. He's had no time to take a position on Son of 
103. 
</P>
<P>
Rosenfield insists that he would never embrace a cause that Nader didn't 
support. Nader, he also points out, became active in insurance reform only 
after the Proposition 103 signature process was well under way. 
</P>
<P>
Compounding Voter Revolt's political problem is that only one of the major 
candidates in either party for the new post of elected insurance commissioner 
backs Son of 103. Conway Collis, a member of the state Board of Equalization 
and Voter Revolt's major fund-raiser, has endorsed it. Not so former Common 
Cause director Walter Zelman and TV commentator Bill Press, neither of whom 
were strong Proposition 103 boosters. 
</P>
<P>
Which make's Nader's role all the more important. Unless he actively backs Son 
of Proposition 103 early in the new year, Voter Revolt's effect on state 
politics may prove to have been the equivalent of a meteor shower rather than a 
comet. 
</P>
<P>
Although campaign reports will not become public until late January, it's 
likely that Sen. Pete Wilson, virtually certain to be the GOP nominee, will 
have a cash edge over both his potential November gubernatorial foes, Atty. 
Gen. John Van de Kamp or former San Francisco Mayor Dianne Feinstein. The 
senator's expected $4.5 million on hand may top the combined war chests of 
both. 
</P>
<P>
Van de Kamp will have somewhere between $2.5 million and $3 million, depending 
on how much money he sinks into signature-qualification drives for his three 
initiatives aimed at the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
Feinstein's war chest could hit about $1.5 million as a result of the 
seven-figure check she and her money-manager husband, Richard Blum, were 
expected to contribute to her campaign.

True -- on the surface -- a politician can be voted out of office or recalled. 
But, in truth, how many incumbents fail to win reelection after serving two or

TERM LIMITS FOR ELECTED OFFICIALS

<P>
You say (without explaining the connection) that term limits "would upset the 
balance of power between elected officials, who often require years of service 
to command the details of policy questions." But such limits would, on the 
contrary, allow more fairness in elections. Any pol who can't give up 
fund-raising long enough to learn such details in two terms should be replaced 
by someone smarter and more dedicated. 
</P>
<P>
Most disturbing, you say, is that term limits "would constitute a collective 
admission that our government and our politics have failed." On the contrary, 
both would be improved, because many more people would vote and the quality of 
politics would thereby improve. Our present disgracefully low voter turnout is 
directly due to a feeling of helplessness in any effort to displace incumbents, 
no matter how incompetent. And finally, your professed faith in the people's 
ability to recognize official corruption and turn the rascals out via vote or 
recall in timely fashion is, unfortunately, pitiful.

Your editorial is marching to a different drummer. The majority of the public 
did not elect officials for life so that they could pocket perks, pensions and 
personal mistresses. 
</P>
<P>
As a lifelong Republican, many of my associates agree with Atty. Gen. John Van 
de Kamp that two-term limits are a necessity. We will vote "yes" for this 
nonpartisan issue.

Two terms was good enough for the founding fathers, and it should be good

PALMDALE AIRPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
On behalf of the Board of Airport Commissioners and the Department of Airports 
staff, I want to congratulate The Times for its editorial "An Airport Ready to 
Take Off" (Dec. 18). 
</P>
<P>
We are most excited about the introduction of commercial service at the 
Palmdale Regional Airport. The Palmdale facility is vital to the future of air 
transportation in Southern California. Given the ground congestion around LAX, 
residents of the San Fernando Valley and the Antelope and Santa Clarita Valleys 
and Ventura County will find it easier and less expensive (because of free 
parking) in the years to come to fly from Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
Palmdale will realize its potential only if the federal and state governments 
help us build mass transit to link the airport to other airports and population 
centers throughout Southern California. I, for one, am at a loss when I hear 
that the only route for the proposed Las Vegas-to-Anaheim "bullet train" must 
be a direct line from Las Vegas to Victorville to Anaheim. If this "bullet 
train" is to be subsidized by the taxpayers of California, by virtue of the 
grants of rights-of-way through federal and state land, then I submit that the 
train route ought to become an integral part of a network of light-rail lines 
planned with the long-term interests of all of Southern California in mind. 
</P>
<P>
The City of Los Angeles Airport Commission is anxious to do its part to help 
create the light-rail links essential to the future economic development of the 
Los Angeles Basin. Working with other airport organizations around the nation, 
we are lobbying Congress for permission to assess a Passenger Facility Charge 
similar to those imposed by airports throughout Europe and Asia. A modest 
charge could generate sufficient revenue for necessary airport-related 
infrastructure, including a light-rail link to Palmdale.

THE WORD THEY USE IS SCARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
We have been visiting doctors, nurses, technicians and administrators in the 
wards and clinics that serve people infected with the human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, asking them to assess the situation. The word 
they used most often was scary. 
</P>
<P>
Demand for services is outpacing development of new services. Thousands will be 
denied life-extending therapies, identified by the National Institute of 
Allergies and Infectious Diseases last summer, unless there is a rapid 
expansion of programs. But no new money is in sight. Clearly, the crisis in 
AIDS-related services and facilities, thought to be years away, is here and 
now. 
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County alone would have to triple its budget next year to provide 
the early intervention procedures recommended by the U.S. Public Health 
Service. Orange County estimates that its facilities can meet less than half 
the demand for new services. Already there are waits as long as eight weeks for 
out-patient services in Los Angeles County, with waiting lists, even for the 
dying, for access to hospice care. Los Angeles County exhausted its AIDS 
home-care budget in the first five months of the fiscal year and has had to 
divert $650,000 from other health care to keep the program going. Home care is 
under review amidst growing concerns about the cost, averaging $8,000 a month, 
higher than a residential nursing facility. Yet there are only 100 beds in 
residential nursing facilities for AIDS patients in Los Angeles County, and 
most of those beds are not state- licensed and therefore not useable for 
Medi-Cal or other publicly funded patients. 
</P>
<P>
Throughout the state there is a serious shortage of skilled AIDS health-care 
workers. The new West Hollywood Clinic, intended to be a model for early 
intervention for HIV-infected persons, is running at 75% of its target 
capacity, short two nurses and relying on part-time physicians instead of the 
full-time doctor planned initially. Three-fourths of the nurses in the AIDS 
ward at Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center are hired from a nurses' registry 
because the hospital has been unable to recruit enough permanent staff. The 
staff of the dental clinic of AIDS Project Los Angeles has declined to the time 
equivalent of one dentist, forcing patients to wait as long as four months for 
non-emergency procedures. 
</P>
<P>
Some progress is being made. California has received a supplementary federal 
grant of$5.4 million for AZT and other prescription drugs, and that money is 
now being distributed to the counties. The money cannot be used for the cost of 
health-care workers required to monitor early interventions, however. The new 
West Hollywood Clinic is developing a program of early intervention for the 
HIV-positive population that can later be offered at regional health centers as 
funds and staff become available. The Los Angeles County/USC Medical Center's 
new 20-bed AIDS wards, as attractive and up to date as any facility of its sort 
in the nation, is operating at capacity. Ground will be broken soon for a new 
out-patient AIDS clinic at County/USC that will double the capacity of existing 
facilities, alleviating the clinic over-crowding and shortening the waiting 
time that now runs as long as eight weeks. 
</P>
<P>
The critical new challenge now is to provide the early intervention services 
that are the key to extending the lives of HIV-infected persons. Development of 
these new procedures, according to Dr. Louis S. Sullivan, secretary of health 
and human services, represents a "significant milestone in the battle to change 
AIDS from a fatal disease to a treatable one." But the cost is high. Los 
Angeles County, with an estimated 112,000 persons with the HIV infection, 
expects the demand for county-provided early intervention to rise to 30,000, 
but now can serve only 2,000. And so it is in most other areas of the state and 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
The prospect is indeed scary.

Today, I woke up and read "The Two-Term Illusion", and could not believe that 
The Times and I would ever agree on any editorial issue. Your editorial was 
right on target. A two-term limit for politicians would not be the panacea many 
people are praying will occur in our political system.

UNCLE SAM NEEDS YOU . . . AND YOU . . . IN 1990 CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
For 200 years, it's been as punctual as Halley's Comet or a groundhog searching 
for a shadow. And while it fails to announce if spring has sprung, it offers 
revealing insights into American society, from our ethnic origins to whether we 
rode to work last week in a ferryboat or a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
It's time for the U.S. Census, an exhaustive ritual of self-examination that 
kicks off each new decade by virtually turning the nation -- and Orange County 
-- inside out. Beginning in late March, local residents will get their chance 
to stand up and be counted along with country cousins and city slickers across 
America. 
</P>
<P>
The demographic snapshot will compute the nation's new population, which is 
expected to rise to 250 million people, about 2.3 million of them in Orange 
County. It also serves as the federal government's prime yardstick for 
measuring the needs of individual communities and delivers a wealth 
ofinformation on how we lead our lives. 
</P>
<P>
As a result of the new tally, Orange County is expected to gain at least one 
more representative in Congress and the state Legislature, as well as a bigger 
share of about $30 billion in federal tax dollars that trickle down for a 
variety of services, from freeway construction to school lunch programs. 
</P>
<P>
The county should also gain a new perspective of itself. 
</P>
<P>
Demographers predict the 1990 census will finally topple the long-held 
stereotype of Orange County as a homogeneous stronghold of well-heeled whites, 
depicting instead a region that includes a cosmopolitan mix of Latinos, 
Indochinese and others. Moreover, the Census Bureau will make a concerted 
attempt to count the homeless, providing Orange County its most complete 
reckoning to date of the poverty that exists amid the palm trees and BMWs. 
</P>
<P>
"This census will show that Orange County is a much more complex region than is 
often our image," said Mark Baldassare, a professor of social ecology at UC 
Irvine. "It will demonstrate that we're not just the home of middle-class 
families, but of a diverse population." 
</P>
<P>
Counting so varied a citizenry will not be easy. While most residents will 
dutifully fill out and mail back the questionnaires the Census Bureau 
dispatches the last week in March, demographers and other experts worry that 
illegal aliens and other immigrants fearful of the government may prove more 
elusive. 
</P>
<P>
Eager to avoid an undercount in the very communities that need federal 
assistance the most, census officials and city leaders have launched ambitious 
programs to promote participation in the survey. But even those best efforts 
could fall short. For example, some local officials predict that one of every 
five people in the county's burgeoning Asian community will not be counted. 
</P>
<P>
"Many Asians and Latinos have a traditional fear and distrust of government," 
noted Fernando Tafoya, a district manager in central Orange County for the 
Census Bureau. "Now we're asking them to step forward and provide information 
on their household. There's a natural hesitancy." 
</P>
<P>
For the vast majority of Orange County residents, however, the census will be 
little more than a short exercise with a black lead pencil, toting up family 
members and answering a few simple questions about where they live. Only one of 
six households will receive a longer version of the form, with 59 questions 
probing a wide range of topics. 
</P>
<P>
The answers that cascade into the Census Bureau after April 1, the deadline for 
mailing back the national survey, will have a broad impact on the lives of 
residents in Orange County and across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
For starters, the census will count the nation's population -- as it has every 
decade since 1790 -- to provide data for congressional reapportionment, the 
constitutional foundation and legal purpose of the survey. 
</P>
<P>
But the census has come to be appreciated less for its head counts, which can 
be predicted ahead of time within 1% or 2%, and more for what it reveals about 
the national condition. The census monitors social and economic patterns 
through the decades, producing statistics for a variety of uses. 
</P>
<P>
For academic researchers, the census unearths shards of data that no mere 
survey could reveal. It arms businesses with high-powered statistics for 
marketing battles, plotting the characteristics of consumers down to the 
smallest city block. Urban planners use census figures to decipher details on 
commuting patterns, housing conditions and economic diversity. 
</P>
<P>
"The census provides a comprehensive picture of Orange County and the nation," 
said Bill Gayk, the county demographer. "It gives us a better idea of who the 
public is, who our clients are." 
</P>
<P>
But such a portrait is only as good as the answers people give. 
</P>
<P>
There are few deterrents to fudging on the census aside from a sense of 
honesty, old-fashioned national pride and a virtually unenforced law requiring 
U.S. citizens to answer all census questions to the best of their knowledge. 
The same law keeps the information confidential for 72 years, the average 
American's life span. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the leeway for statistical mischief, census officials say that the vast 
majority of Americans appear to take the census seriously. 
</P>
<P>
The census comes at a price -- this time, it is expected to cost the government 
$2.6 billion. That's more than $10 for each man, woman and child tallied. The 
bill exceeds the budget of many states and is double the cost of the 1980 
count. But supporters say it's the price of our democratic process. They argue 
that the 1990 census, which marks the survey's bicentennial year, will see a 
count that's not only bigger than its predecessors, but better. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials begin planning the census questionnaire years in advance, 
holding scores of public hearings and entertaining ideas from government 
officials, outside researchers and interest groups. Lobbying for space on the 
form can grow heated and combative. Some pet food companies, for instance, have 
in recent years conducted intense letter-writing campaigns in a fruitless push 
for a census question tallying the number of dogs and cats in U.S. households. 
</P>
<P>
"The census has to serve the widest possible set of users, and the competition 
for turf on the questionnaire is intense," said Al Paez, data requirements 
chief for the Census Bureau's national planning division. "Every inch on that 
form is worth a fortune for commercial marketing and academic research." 
</P>
<P>
While the bureau by policy avoids adding lots of questions each decade, the 
1990 census includes some changes. Aside from the usual queries about the basic 
characteristics of a home and who lives there, the 1990 census has questions 
that should help illuminate changing family structures in America, with new 
categories to count stepchildren as well as unmarried couples. 
</P>
<P>
Other changes are sprinkled through the longer version of the census. Motorists 
are asked not only how far they drive to work, but when they leave home each 
morning, a query that could help transportation planners in bustling Orange 
County better manage the roadways. New questions also inquire about condominium 
fees, home equity loans and solar heating. The census even asks if you own a 
stable of seven or more motor vehicles -- or don't own any at all. 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps the most notable addition to the 1990 census doesn't appear on the 
form. Beginning at 6 p.m. on March 20, census workers will fan out on streets 
across the country for the most aggressive nationwide count of the homeless in 
U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
While census officials are careful not to label the effort as the end-all tally 
of the homeless, they expect far more accurate numbers than in 1980, when 
shelters and flophouses were surveyed but people on the streets were largely 
missed. 
</P>
<P>
The homeless weren't the only ones left uncounted in the last census, which 
omitted an estimated 1.4% of the population. Most of the 3 million people 
missed in 1980 were minorities, illegal aliens (who by law are included in the 
count) and other newcomers unfamiliar with the need for an accurate tally of 
the nation's population, authorities say. The undercount among black and Latino 
inner-city residents, for example, was estimated at 12%. 
</P>
<P>
The inability to count these people has sparked an important debate. With the 
census serving as a key measure for determining how much money is doled out by 
the federal government and state during the next 10 years, several cities in 
Orange County and elsewhere in the country stand to lose millions of dollars if 
their populations aren't properly tallied. 
</P>
<P>
Hoping to offset an undercount, officials in many of these cities have been 
organizing special committees and planning promotional campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
Santa Ana has launched perhaps the most ambitious effort, earning praise from 
top Census Bureau officials as one of four "model cities" in the nation. The 
city is working to enlist local supermarkets to stuff grocery bags with 
information pamphlets, recruit school children to spread the word and produce a 
TV video extolling the merits of the census. 
</P>
<P>
Even with such endeavors, census officials anticipate that, come April 1, 
nearly one of four people in the United States will not have been counted. It's 
then that the hard part starts, as squadrons of census takers begin the 
laborious chore of calling or visiting residents who have not been caught in 
the net of the national canvass. 
</P>
<P>
Though the census has climbed ever closer each decade to the magic 100% count 
of the American populace, the ratio of returned census forms has tumbled, and 
that means a major expense for the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
In 1970, the first census to make serious use of the U.S. Postal Service, 85% 
of those who were asked to return the form in the mail did so. Last time, the 
return rate fell to 83%. Rehearsals for the 1990 count have led census 
officials to expect a cooperation rate of about 78%. 
</P>
<P>
Federal officials say the census seems to be suffering because of the 
ever-increasing volume of "junk" mail and a growing mistrust of prying surveys. 
It's an expensive trend, because every 1% drop in participation means $5 
million to $10 million extra must be spent to hire census-takers. 
</P>
<P>
"We're going to be busy," said Joe Montes, a census district manager in Orange 
County. "We expect perhaps as high as a 30% non-response rate around here. If 
that figure holds up in our district, it'll entail sending quite a few 
enumerators to the households to get the information." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the bureau has set up four district offices and started 
hiring temporary employees that by Census Day will number more than 1,000. 
They're part of nearly 500,000 workers that will be deployed across the country 
when the census kicks into high gear in the coming months. 
</P>
<P>
Indeed, local census officials have been preparing as if they were going to 
war. They have quizzed various city officials to glean "local knowledge" of the 
communities that may prove most difficult to count. Maps have been drawn up 
outlining areas that need multilingual census takers or pose an undercount 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
The district offices have all the glamour of a MASH unit. While the Santa Ana 
headquarters is in a gleaming office tower, the atmosphere is stark inside. 
Cardboard desks and filing cabinets are flanked by rows of portable computer 
terminals, evidence that these are merely temporary quarters designed to be 
torn down soon after the tally has concluded. 
</P>
<P>
But the work won't stop when the counting is done. Census employees at the 
bureau's national headquarters in Suitland, Md., will be busy crunching numbers 
and tabulating information for several years. The final tally of the nation's 
population and congressional apportionment counts are not even expected until 
the end of 1990. After those figures are computed, other statistics from the 
Census Bureau will slowly trickle out between 1991 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
Some critics complain that the raw census data, which the public can purchase 
on computer disks or in typewritten form, isn't available soon enough to stay 
abreast of some trends, especially in fast-paced locales like Orange County. 
Moreover, demographers note that the census data rarely produces surprises for 
them, since most of the statistical blips and bounces of society have been 
roughly charted all along by less-weighty surveys. 
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, academic researchers and others are eagerly awaiting the decennial 
check of the nation's pulse, noting that it will provide a solid base for 
future research while buttressing or undermining the predictions of the 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
"Because the census is so large in scope, it allows us to uncover trends that 
may not be obvious with samples of 500 to 1,000 residents," UC Irvine's 
Baldassare said. 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County, the census will likely reveal changes that mirror many of 
those sweeping the United States -- a profound ethnic shift led by swelling 
numbers of Latinos and Asians, a growing polarization of socioeconomic 
conditions and a shrinking middle class. 
</P>
<P>
But the census should also illuminate demographic tendencies indigenous to the 
region, such as the increasing tilt of the population toward the fast-growing 
south, the proliferation of minorities in the north and the ballooning 
affluence of the coastal strip. 
</P>
<P>
Several life-style changes may also be highlighted. With the skyrocketing cost 
of housing in Orange County, the census might demonstrate that more adult 
children are living with their parents, demographers predict. The region's 
family fabric might be exposed by census statistics on "blended" households 
that result when couples divorce and then form anew in subsequent marriages. 
</P>
<P>
But it will likely be the ethnic and racial shifts that garner the most 
attention, experts say. The Vietnamese community, barely a notch on the charts 
in 1980 with about 20,000 inhabitants in Orange County, could swell to more 
than 100,000 with the 1990 census, some experts predict. Latinos are expected 
to rise from 14.8% of the county's population in 1980 to about 20% in the 
coming count, with numbers in excess of 400,000. 
</P>
<P>
"With each census, there's a certain amount of remaking the image of a 
community, and Orange County is no different," said Ken Chew, a demographer at 
UC Irvine. "It may surprise some people." 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
THE NEW CENSUS: Nine key changes for 1990. 
</P>
<P>
For most Orange County residents, the census form that will arrive in late 
March won't look very different from its 1980 predecessor. Just like last time, 
there are the questions on your home and who lives there. But there are also 
some modest changes since 1980. A few examples of what's new: 
</P>
<P>
FAMILY 
</P>
<P>
1.New categories for stepson/stepdaughter and grandchild, providing new 
information on how families separate and form anew. 
</P>
<P>
2. New category for unmarried partner, allowing researchers to count the number 
of cohabitating couples, both heterosexual and homosexual. 
</P>
<P>
HOUSING 
</P>
<P>
3. Higher dollar figures for home prices. The top bracket in 1980 was "$200,000 
or more." It increases to "$500,000 or more" in the 1990 form, reflecting the 
soaring price of housing. 
</P>
<P>
4. Rents also went up in the 1980s, and the top rent category doubles from 
"$500 or more" in 1980 to "$1000 or more" in the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
5. Condo fees make their first appearance. Will provide valuable information in 
Orange County, where one of five dwellings is a single-family attached home. 
</P>
<P>
EDUCATION 
</P>
<P>
6. New form asks for the highest grade completed, not just the number of school 
years attended. It also wants to know about college degrees for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
HEALTH 
</P>
<P>
7. A new question. Asks whether disabled have difficulty going outside the home 
alone or caring for themselves. Could cast the spotlight anew on the needs of 
the disabled in Orange County and across the country. 
</P>
<P>
COMMUTING 
</P>
<P>
8. Cars and trucks-once individual categories-now lumped together. Category 
ended with "three or more vehicles" in 1980, but new version was expanded 
because of prolilferating muticar families. 
</P>
<P>
9. While 1980 census asked how long it took people to get to work, the 1990 
form also asks when they leave for work. Should provide valuable information 
for transportation planners.

SWEATSHOP VICTIMS CITE HARASSMENT BY BOSSES; 
</P>

EMPLOYMENT: WORKERS SAY THEIR COOPERATION WITH A SEWING SHOP CRACKDOWN HAS 
GOTTEN THEM BLACKLISTED. THE ALLEGATIONS HAVE RESULTED IN ANOTHER 
INVESTIGATION.

<P>
Seven garment workers who cooperated with a recent federal crackdown on Orange 
County sweatshops now say they have been blacklisted, intimidated or forced to 
give kickbacks to their bosses, prompting a second round of investigations by 
the U.S. Department of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
In several cases, sewing shop owners who were ordered to make up unpaid minimum 
or overtime wages wrote checks to their workers but then allegedly forced them 
to give the money back, said Rolene Otero, director of enforcement for the 
department's wages and hours division in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
Another worker said her boss followed her home after she cashed her check and 
demanded she return the money -- a story the boss vehemently denies. The Labor 
Department has filed suit against the boss, seeking to collect the unpaid wages 
and forestall any retribution. 
</P>
<P>
Although labor officials have documented widespread abuses in Orange County 
sewing shops and ordered 18 shops to pay back wages, they are finding it 
difficult to get the money into the hands of the victimized workers. 
</P>
<P>
"I had employers take employees to the bank, have them sign the (settlement) 
check, hand the cash over to the employer in the bank lobby, and then sign a 
receipt saying they got the money," Otero said. "They (the employers) just told 
them it was a formality that had to be done and took advantage of the 
ignorance" of the employees, who were all recent immigrants from Mexico, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Otero said four workers surrendered to their bosses settlements ranging from 
$300 to almost $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to those four workers, three others have complained to the 
department that they have been refused work because they were known to have 
cooperated with a federal investigation of their former bosses. 
</P>
<P>
Worried that the fear of retaliation will silence other workers, Otero is 
threatening legal action against anyone who harasses a federal witness. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think they understand how powerful the federal government is," Otero 
said. "Their refusal to admit that the law applies to them just baffles me. 
They're looking for any way around it at all." 
</P>
<P>
"It's outrageous," said Max Mont, a longtime labor watchdog who helped draft 
the last round of garment industry reform laws a decade ago. "It's an outright 
shakedown, not merely a labor law violation. It certainly will have the effect 
of discouraging any (further) reports of violations if they can intimidate 
workers out of their rights." 
</P>
<P>
Alice Callaghan, director of Las Familias del Pueblo, a community and legal aid 
center for workers in the Los Angeles garment district, said she had heard 
stories of Los Angeles garment workers being threatened when they tried to 
collect unpaid wages but had never heard of bosses trying to commandeer 
government-ordered checks. 
</P>
<P>
Callaghan said such alleged retaliation was "awful" but not particularly 
surprising. "Owners of factories will stoop to almost anything," she said. 
"Otherwise they wouldn't let people work 55 hours a week for $50 dollars, or 
let them work for a couple of weeks and then never pay them." 
</P>
<P>
Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, employers may not discriminate 
against or fire employees for cooperating with federal labor inspections, Otero 
said. Violators face a maximum fine of $10,000 and six months in jail. 
</P>
<P>
"I've just got to sit down with these subcontractors and explain to them what 
the law is and that when they are dealing with the federal government we're not 
going to slap somebody's wrist and go away," she added. 
</P>
<P>
Fueled by an influx of immigrant labor, about 400 such garment contracting 
shops have sprung up in Orange County within the last few years, supplying Los 
Angeles labels with everything from shorts to party dresses. 
</P>
<P>
Most shops are owned by Vietnamese immigrants who themselves toil long hours 
for paltry profits. They in turn employ Southeast Asian and Latino workers for 
wages that in some cases are as low as $1 an hour, federal and state labor 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
One 7-year-old boy worked hundreds of hours helping his mother sew designer 
clothes in their Santa Ana home, for wages that averaged $1.45 an hour, federal 
officials said. The shop owner they worked for signed a consent decree agreeing 
to repay the family more than $22,700 in minimum and overtime wages owed to 
them, including nearly $3,200 owed David Valladares, now 8. 
</P>
<P>
The Valladares family still has not received the money. In fact, according to 
Otero, recalcitrant owners and red tape have delayed payment of most of the 
$180,000 that 18 shops were ordered to pay to more than 200 other garment 
workers as a result of the August investigation. 
</P>
<P>
In a second crackdown in October, 14 more shops were inspected, but Otero 
declined to release details because those cases are still pending. 
</P>
<P>
Otero said several of the shop owners have reached out-of-court 
</P>
<P>
agreements with the government under which the employers agreed to begin paying 
workers properly and keep records to prove it, and were in turn allowed several 
years to repay the back wages owed their workers. 
</P>
<P>
Some have kept their part of the bargain. For example, Otero's inspectors found 
that Vo Ba Cuong, owner of Queen's Fashions Inc. of Garden Grove, had violated 
overtime laws. Cuong, who sews junior sportswear for All That Jazz Inc., 
insisted his employees had not worked overtime. Nonetheless, he said, he signed 
a consent decree agreeing to pay 14 workers a total of $11,000. 
</P>
<P>
"He came in two days later with a cashier's check for one-quarter of the back 
wages and has been paying all his employees with cashier's checks on the 15th 
on the dot ever since," Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
But trying to collect money from several other sewing shops and get it into the 
hands of the workers has been "a nightmare," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, the Department of Labor filed suit against one of the garment 
contractors, Joanne Fashions of Santa Ana, which made dresses for La Belle 
Fashions Inc., a junior clothing manufacturer in Los Angeles. The complaint, 
filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, alleges that the former owners of 
Joanne Fashions violated federal labor laws and discriminated against workers 
who told labor inspectors they had been underpaid. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Fashions was one of 18 sewing shops in and around Westminster's Little 
Saigon that were cited for wage and hour violations in the August sweep by 
federal labor inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
According to Department of Labor internal investigative documents obtained by 
The Times under the Freedom of Information Act, Joanne Fashions paid workers 
less than $3.25 an hour, denied them overtime pay and gave 12 workers garments 
to sew at home in violation of federal and state laws that prohibit home 
sewing. 
</P>
<P>
Joanne Fashions was sold during the investigation. But former owners Diana Nga 
Ngoc (Diana) Nguyen and her two brothers agreed in a settlement with the 
Department of Labor to pay a total of $12,102 to seven former employees, court 
documents show. 
</P>
<P>
In an interview earlier this month, a sobbing Nguyen insisted that she had been 
paying the minimum wage all along but that two workers lied to federal 
investigators in hopes of getting a big cash settlement. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen nevertheless signed a waiver of the statute of limitations and promised 
to pay the back wages, an agreement she now says was coerced. As a first 
installment on the $12,102 owed, Nguyen wrote checks for a total of $3,425 to 
two workers -- Maria Del Pilar Solano and her mother, Liova Martinez, Nguyen 
and the workers said in separate interviews. 
</P>
<P>
The alleged harassment began, according to Solano, when Nguyen offered to "buy" 
the checks back for $500 in cash, a story Nguyen denounced as "lies." Nguyen 
said that she had lent Solano more than $4,000 and that the mother and daughter 
had promised to return the money after they cashed the checks. Solano said she 
borrowed $200 to pay a doctor's bill but never borrowed thousands or promised 
to hand over the back wages. 
</P>
<P>
According to Solano, when she and her mother arrived at the bank to cash their 
checks, Nguyen was there waiting for them. Solano said Nguyen followed them 
home and demanded they hand over the cash. When they refused, Solano said, 
Nguyen began to yell and threaten them and demanded they return several gifts 
she had given them, including clothing for Solano's children. Solano said she 
did return the $200 she had borrowed. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen said she just happened, by coincidence, to be at the bank when the women 
arrived. She insists she never went to the women's home, never threatened them 
and was never repaid the thousands she lent them. 
</P>
<P>
"I was kind to them when they worked for me," Nguyen said, her face swollen 
with tears. "When they borrowed money from me, I always gave it to them. . . . 
They took advantage of me." 
</P>
<P>
Otero said the alleged incident at the bank and the failure to pay the rest of 
the money owed prompted the federal suit. 
</P>
<P>
Nguyen, however, alleged that from the first, the labor investigators have been 
biased in favor of the Latino workers. She charged that Otero has discriminated 
against her because she is Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
"She (Otero) didn't believe anything I told her," said Nguyen, speaking in 
Vietnamese through an interpreter. "She didn't want to listen to my side of the 
story." 
</P>
<P>
"She was treated the same way everyone else was," Otero said. "She and I had 
three conferences, and we reduced the back wages by about 30% based on her side 
of the story." 
</P>
<P>
What is not in dispute is that Nguyen has made no further payments to the 
workers. The Labor Department's suit seeks to force Nguyen and her brothers to 
pay the rest of the back wages, with interest, and to enjoin them from 
discriminating against the workers. 
</P>
<P>
No legal action has been taken against La Belle Fashions Inc., officials said, 
despite a new federal policy of trying to hold manufacturers accountable for 
labor abuses by their contractors. The policy is based on the 1938 "hot goods" 
law, which forbids the shipping across state lines of products made in 
violation of federal labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
"We have just begun talking with La Belle and have not come to any 
conclusions," Otero said. 
</P>
<P>
La Belle co-owner David Kashanian said the company has been asked to freeze 
payment to another Orange County contractor that had allegedly not paid its 
workers properly. He declined to name the contractor. 
</P>
<P>
But Kashanian said he was not aware of any abuses at Joanne Fashions and has 
not done business with the Nguyens since they sold their shop in September. He 
said La Belle cannot be held responsible for how its contractors treat their 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
"Is this my job, if you work for some other company, to put my nose in to see 
if you got the right wage?" he asked. "This is not under my name. I cannot 
control it." 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Solano, her mother and Juana Valladares say they have been branded 
troublemakers and refused work at other garment shops as word has spread that 
they cooperated with the government. 
</P>
<P>
Valladares supplied Otero with the names of two sewing shops she says refused 
to hire her. One store owner told her he had no work for her "because you 
talk," Valladares said. Otero confirmed that she is investigating those 
allegations. In the meantime, Valladares says she may try to find work as a 
janitor. 
</P>
<P>
Otero said her office has affidavits from the other workers and is 
investigating their complaints. She said all of the complaints have come from 
Latino workers, though many Southeast Asian workers were also owed back wages. 
Otero said she suspects some of the Asians have been subjected to similar 
pressure tactics but are reluctant to complain. 
</P>
<P>
"Not one of them would talk to us about it," Otero said. "But if we get signed 
receipts that say somebody received their money, there's simply nothing we can 
do about it."

QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ON THE CENSUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Maybe you haven't filled out a census form before, or the past decade has 
turned memories of the last one a bit foggy. Here are some common questions 
about the 1990 U.S. Census, and some answers: 
</P>
<P>
Q. When will I get the census form? How do I get one? 
</P>
<P>
A. Most people will get one via the U.S. Postal Service. The Census Bureau will 
mail questionnaires to more than 100-million households across the country on 
March 23. All you have to do is complete it with a pencil and mail it back by 
April 1, which is the official Census Day. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How long will it take to fill one out? 
</P>
<P>
A. The questionnaire comes in two forms. One of every six U.S. households will 
receive a copy of the "long form," which takes about 43 minutes to complete, 
according to census officials. But the rest will get the "short form," which 
takes an average of 14 minutes to fill out. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What if I don't get a form in the mail or lose it? 
</P>
<P>
A. Don't worry. Just call one of the bureau's local district offices (Orange 
County has four of them) and ask for a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Why is the government taking the census? 
</P>
<P>
A. The census is conducted at the start of each new decade to determine the 
nation's population so seats in Congress can be properly apportioned. The 
population counts are also used to divide $30 billion in federal money and even 
more from the states for a variety of government programs -- transportation 
improvements, social services, health care. Statistics derived from the census 
are used by academic researchers, business marketeers, civic planners and 
others for a variety of purposes. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What kinds of questions are on the census? 
</P>
<P>
A. The short form asks seven questions about you and your family -- including 
your sex, ethnic origin and race, age and marital status. It also has seven 
queries about your household, such as how much your home cost and how many 
rooms it has. 
</P>
<P>
The long form includes all those questions and more -- 59 in all. It asks about 
your home's plumbing and kitchen facilities, whether you have a telephone, how 
many cars you have, the cost of utilities, how much you pay for insurance. It 
also inquires about your schooling, job, income, how well you speak English, 
military service, whether a health condition makes it difficult to get around 
and how long it takes you to get to work. And a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Aren't some of those questions kind of personal? 
</P>
<P>
A. They're all very personal -- and very important. Each one is on the form for 
a specific purpose. Data on commuters can be used to build a better 
transportation system, statistics on income levels can help authorities 
determine where to funnel money for housing assistance. 
</P>
<P>
It's important to remember that all the information is, by law, confidential. 
The census bureau does not release information on an individual for 72 years 
(the average American's life span). 
</P>
<P>
Each respondent's questionnaire can only be viewed by authorized census 
personnel. It cannot be released to other government agencies such as the 
Internal Revenue Service or FBI. The Census Bureau boasts of its nearly 
spotless record, noting that employees who have leaked information have been 
jailed. 
</P>
<P>
Q. What happens if I don't mail in my census questionnaire by April 1? 
</P>
<P>
A. Eventually, the Census Bureau will come after you. A few weeks after Census 
Day, the bureau begins its follow-up operation, visiting people who have not 
returned a form. The census takers will have red, white and blue briefcases and 
plastic identification tags. You can't miss them. They'll be the ones asking 
all the questions. 
</P>
<P>
Q. Do I have to participate? 
</P>
<P>
A. That's one of those gray areas. Census officials say participation is the 
patriotic thing to do. It's also the law. The same federal regulation that 
makes the census confidential also requires a U.S. resident to answer the 
questions to the best of his or her knowledge. The penalty is a $100 fine. 
</P>
<P>
But some people refuse to participate, either out of an unfounded fear or a 
dislike of prying surveys. It rarely seems to matter. Census officials could 
not cite one case where they have prosecuted someone who refused to participate 
in the national survey. 
</P>
<P>
Q. I recently noticed some people who are living full-time in a tent at a 
campground down the street from my house. Will they be counted? 
</P>
<P>
A. Yes. Aside from sending out questionnaires to millions of U.S. households, 
the bureau conducts several programs to count people without fixed addresses. 
Beginning the night of March 20, the bureau will tally the homeless. On March 
31, the census will conduct "transient night," counting people living in 
campgrounds, YMCA's, youth hostels, with traveling carnivals or other vagabond 
enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
Q. How soon will we get census results? 
</P>
<P>
A. The nation's population and Congressional apportionment counts are not 
expected until the end of 1990. Other statistics will be released between 1991 
and 1993.

A small but determined band of homeowners gathered at W.O. Hart Park on 
Saturday to kick off their three-week campaign to put the Irvine Co.'s 
7,110-acre commercial and residential development for east Orange before the 
voters.

They were angry enough; the question is do they have enough support to gather 
the 7,000 signatures they need to put the issue on the June election ballot. 
</P>
<P>
"We can do it," said Dorothy Hudecek of the Five Coves Conservancy. "People all 
over this city are going to be seeing a lot of us the next couple of weeks." 
</P>
<P>
The City Council on Dec. 19 approved the mammoth new planned community by a 5-0 
vote, with Mayor Don E. Smith calling it a "historic" development, the largest 
the Irvine Co. has ever proposed. Annexed into the city in phases, it would 
eventually include more than 12,000 new homes -- increasing the city's 
population by about 40% -- plus a commercial and hotel center that would mean 
25,000 new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
The opponents have until Jan. 18 to come up with signatures from 10% of the 
city's 54,098 registered voters to take the decision away from the City Council 
and put it before the voters. The homeowners opposing the development say they 
need 7,000 signatures to compensate for duplicate signatures and non-registered 
voters or non-city residents who might sign. 
</P>
<P>
The Hart Park meeting Saturday was called so the leaders could pass out the 
first batch of petitions and give everyone a pep talk. 
</P>
<P>
"You need some kind of slogan people can identify with," said Harry Huggins, a 
supporter from neighboring Tustin. 
</P>
<P>
"How about 'Save Orange'?" someone shouted. 
</P>
<P>
"Great!" Huggins said. "Save Orange from being destroyed by this development." 
</P>
<P>
Sherry Meddick, who lives in a neighboring unincorporated area, is planning to 
have petitioners register new voters. 
</P>
<P>
She and others were defensive about any suggestion that they didn't seem to 
have enough people at the Saturday gathering to pull off such a massive task. 
</P>
<P>
"You need 70 people to collect 100 signatures each; if you look at it that way, 
it isn't so difficult," she said. 
</P>
<P>
The chief organizer was Allan Beek, who wore a hat declaring "No 2nd City." 
</P>
<P>
"We'll all meet back here again next Saturday for more petitions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Beek is from Newport Beach. He was called on by Orange friends because of his 
experience in getting issues on the ballot in his own city. 
</P>
<P>
"I may not live in Orange, but I do live in Orange County," Beek said. "And 
everyone in Orange County should be concerned about this development." 
</P>
<P>
The homeowners were united in the reasons for their opposition to the Irvine 
Co. plan. 
</P>
<P>
"It's too big," said Bob Seibert of the Santiago Creek Homeowners Assn. "Too 
dense, too much traffic." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine Co. officials claim that their plans to upgrade city roads and build new 
roads will substantially offset any additional traffic. But the Hart Park 
people weren't buying it. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't want New York; we don't want Detroit, we don't even want L.A.," said 
Orange resident Sharon Seibert. 
</P>
<P>
"The city doesn't seem to care about what we want," Orange resident Marty 
Martini said. "The council's feeling is, if we don't do it, Anaheim will get 
it. Well, let Anaheim have it." 
</P>
<P>
But two men who paced gingerly in the background at the gathering predict the 
petition drive is doomed, because Orange residents will not support it. 
</P>
<P>
Bob Walters and Ted Botens, who live in the hills overlooking most of the city, 
claim the development would benefit the city through more jobs, a better tax 
base, and the Irvine Co. agreement to include recreational facilities and 2,700 
acres of open space. 
</P>
<P>
"Eleven homeowner groups from the hills have already supported this 
development," Walters said. "We mitigated much that we didn't like. Where were 
all these people when we were mitigating some of these issues?" 
</P>
<P>
Botens and Walters said the plan should increase the tax base by $2 million a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
"That money won't be for us in east Orange; it will go to these people in west 
Orange," Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
Others at the park gathering said there was some question whether those 11 
homeowner groups from the hills really supported the development. Botens is 
president of ROCC, Rural Orange Coordinating Council, which ostensibly is made 
up of those 11 groups. ROCC has signed the agreement on the development with 
the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
But Terri Sergeant, vice president of ROCC, said the homeowners who are members 
of those groups oppose the Irvine Co.'s plans. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll gather a lot more signatures there than Ted Botens realizes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the high spirit of the petition backers, Meddick admitted the 
possibility of failure. 
</P>
<P>
"If we don't make it, it will be because we just didn't have enough time," she 
said.

Members of Alcoholics Anonymous are sponsoring their annual "marathon meeting" 
for people who are planning to stay sober this New Year's Eve and may need a 
little support in that quest. 
</P>
<P>
The round-the-clock meeting, at 705 N. Harbor Blvd., began Saturday morning and 
will continue until noon Monday. Members offer fellowship and refreshments for 
those who want to socialize during New Year's but who do not want to celebrate 
with alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
The group usually holds the marathons several times a year during various 
holidays.

REVELERS OFFERED FREE, SAFE WAY HOME; 
</P>
<P>
HOLIDAY: NEW YEAR'S EVE DRINKERS HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE TO GETTING BEHIND THE 
WHEEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
While New Year's Eve celebrators have been bombarded with messages urging them 
not to drink and drive, a quieter effort has been made to offer those who have 
been drinking a safe alternative to trying to swerve their way home. 
</P>
<P>
Two taxi companies, Mothers Against Drunk Driving, a hospital system, a beer 
distributor and a towing service are using their resources to offer drinkers 
free rides home. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be able to handle anybody who calls," said Larry Slagle, president of 
the Yellow Cab in North Orange County, one of two taxi companies offering free 
rides home in cooperation with MADD, CareUnit and Straub Distribution Co. "We 
won't take you to another establishment, but we'll take you home." 
</P>
<P>
Further, midnight will usher in not only the New Year but also a new state law 
that lowers the blood-alcohol level for drunk driving from 0.10 to 0.08. 
</P>
<P>
That means that many people who were legally considered sober enough to drive 
after a few drinks earlier in the evening may not be after midnight, and may 
need a ride home. 
</P>
<P>
Even people whose blood-alcohol level is below the legal limit may be affected 
by their drinking, with altered judgment and slowed reflexes posing a danger to 
themselves and others on the road, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone who does not want to drive home is welcome to use the services, sponsors 
of the free ride programs said. 
</P>
<P>
"All we want is to make sure they don't have an accident on the way home," 
Slagle said. 
</P>
<P>
CareCab and Taxi Time are the only free taxi services that have publicized 
their efforts among bars, nightclubs and police stations countywide. They will 
offer a combined force of about 300 cabs for free rides home. 
</P>
<P>
Both services will take would-be drivers home or to a residence -- provided 
there is no party in progress -- within 20 miles for free, but for longer 
drives, riders will have to pay the difference. 
</P>
<P>
CareCab, the 10th annual program co-sponsored by MADD and CareUnit Hospitals, 
will operate from 7 p.m. to 3 a.m., every night from today to Jan. 2 and can be 
reached from anywhere in the county at (800) 422-4143. 
</P>
<P>
Taxi Time, which is underwritten by Yellow Cab of North Orange County and Coast 
Yellow Cab, and publicized by Straub Distributing Co., runs 6 p.m. to 2 a.m. 
until Jan. 2. Calls to (714) 535-2211 or (714) 546-1311 must be placed by an 
employee of a bar or restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The Laguna Beach Police Department is also operating a taxi service, called 
Tipsy Taxi, which is not free and is available only to city residents by 
calling (714) 494-1121. 
</P>
<P>
Slagle said that representatives from Straub distributed information about Taxi 
Time to area bars and restaurants to encourage employees to watch patrons and 
offer the service if they believe it is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of several large public New Year's Eve parties throughout the county 
have not planned safe-ride programs of their own and expect to direct patrons 
to CareCab and Taxi Time. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the Irvine Hilton and Towers boasts a nearly sold-out New Year's 
Eve celebration in all its dinner, dancing and party rooms but has nothing 
particular planned for the number of potential drunk drivers resulting from the 
festivities. "Not all these people will be staying here in the hotel," so 
party-goers will be referred to the free services, said Jim Martinez, a bellman 
at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
As another alternative for North County residents, Tri-Star Towing is offering 
five of its rigs for free tow services and rides home for residents living in 
or near Fullerton, Brea, Placentia and Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
Owner Glenn Gorman said drivers should call (714) 771-7111 if they need a free 
tow. "All they have to do is call," he said. "We'll deliver them and their car 
to a safe place. . . . If you were going to drink and drive, there is an 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement agencies will be out in full force tonight, with many city 
police employing extra officers for teams whose sole responsibility is to scout 
out people driving under the influence of alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Anaheim police will set up sobriety checkpoints throughout the 
city. And the California Highway Patrol reminds drivers that they may be 
responsible for the cost of emergency roadside care -- such as a response by 
paramedics -- because state law allows emergency response agencies to bill 
drunk drivers for services. 
</P>
<P>
All of those beefed-up law enforcement programs for New Year's Eve come on top 
of the everyday monetary incentive to keep drivers off the roads if they have 
been drinking -- namely, a potential $1,000 fine for first-time offenders, said 
Joe David of the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll be looking for them," said Lt. John Foster of the Huntington Beach 
Police. "If they don't have a (safe) ride home, we'll give them one -- to our 
'hotel.' " Foster was referring to the city jail.

MAN INVITED TO APARTMENT FROM BAR STEALS CAR AFTER BADLY BEATING RESIDENT

Police are looking for a man suspected of severely beating a local resident 
Saturday morning and stealing his car. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Yakush, 38, who had been beaten in the face and upper torso, was found 
by police and paramedics, who received a 4:08 a.m. call that he had been 
attacked in his apartment in the 21000 block of Brookhurst Avenue, Sgt. William 
Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
Yakush was taken to Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach where he was treated and 
released, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
Yakush told police that he met the unidentified man in a bar earlier in the 
evening and had invited the man, described as tall, blond and his early 30s, to 
his apartment. 
</P>
<P>
"After an argument, (Yakush) was beaten," Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
The attacker then fled with Yakush's dark blue Toyota Celica, license number 
2LOD702, Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
Anyone with information about the man or the car is asked to call the 
Huntington Beach Police Department at (714) 536-5951 or (714) 960-8811, 
Peterson said.

OLD MISSION CEMETERY NEARLY FULL AFTER 200 YEARS AS LOCALS' LAST STOP

SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As they have for two centuries, the mourners inched along Ortega Highway, 
oblivious to the 20th-Century traffic jam around them. 
</P>
<P>
The men leading the procession on a recent Saturday marched slowly, carrying 
crosses and candles. Behind them were family, friends, townsfolk and a hearse 
carrying the casket of a longtime San Juan Capistrano resident. 
</P>
<P>
As motorcycle officers blocked intersections leading to the busy San Diego 
Freeway, the head priest from Mission San Juan Capistrano filed by, chanting 
Hail Marys and other prayers. 
</P>
<P>
For a moment on that hot, fall morning it was as if time had stood still. Cars 
and pedestrians stopped in their tracks to watch a ritual that is almost as old 
as the historic community. 
</P>
<P>
The march ended at the Old Mission Cemetery, the final stop for San Juan 
Capistrano residents for the past 200 years, where today the quiet calm around 
the grave site is punctuated by the sound of trucks and cars speeding by on the 
freeway. 
</P>
<P>
The 2-acre, tree-lined hilltop is a great equalizer. Unmarked graves lie not 
far from other plots bearing old wooden crosses over the resting places of 
Indians, settlers and other early residents. 
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the cemetery are headstones and grave markers that spell out the 
history and heritage of San Juan, an area that has grown from a mission town to 
a thriving modern city. 
</P>
<P>
Markers bearing such names as Yorba, Forster, Doram, Luna, Avila, Rios and 
Manriquez are silent reminders of the American Indians of the area who lived, 
worked and died building the town. 
</P>
<P>
There are countless stories etched into the tombstones of children, many of 
whom died at birth or at an early age. Three Civil War veterans lie at rest 
just a few rows away from the graves of Indians and nobility. 
</P>
<P>
According to Mission San Juan Capistrano Church archivist Charles Bodnar, the 
land was deeded by a Scottish settler named James Sheehan in 1879 to the 
Catholic Church for the sum of $100. 
</P>
<P>
Records also show that many Indians and settlers had been buried there since 
the late 1700s, a century before the land was deeded. Before that, the priests 
and Indians were buried at the mission, down the road. 
</P>
<P>
Bodnar has more than a casual interest in the old cemetery on the hill. A few 
years ago, he and an associate rescued the cemetery from the thick brush and 
weeds that were threatening to take over the place. He also repositioned and 
painted the little white crosses that now stand in perfect rows near the 
entrance. 
</P>
<P>
These days the cemetery is maintained by a full-time caretaker who is employed 
by the San Juan Capistrano Mission Catholic Church to carefully rake and weed 
the hilltop site. 
</P>
<P>
Dennis Sommers, 37, himself an American Indian and a native of San Juan 
Capistrano, was given the task of keeping the old graveyard clean. He also must 
hold off the ravages of weather and time that threaten to erode even more names 
from the headstones. 
</P>
<P>
Sommers, who has several family members buried there, remembers a time when San 
Juan Capistrano was so small that everyone knew each other. And so he 
recognizes the names on many gravestones, and sometimes he stops to quietly 
talk to his one-time friends while he drags the rake over the old soil. 
</P>
<P>
"Not to sound like a nut, but yeah, I do talk to the graves. Sometimes I talk 
to my brother. I talk to him and tell him that I'm sorry for the way things 
worked out." 
</P>
<P>
Before the city became so large, most of the townsfolk were buried there, and 
the old cemetery remains the sentimental favorite among locals. But now, 
because of the South County population boom, most are buried in El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
Space at the Old Mission Cemetery is at a premium. There will only be a few 
more of the long processions winding up the Ortega Highway.
