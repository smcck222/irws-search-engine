VIETNAM READY FOR BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to articles on Vietnam seeking to rejoin the international economy 
(front page, Dec. 23-24): 
</P>
<P>
Your article "Getting Back to Business in Vietnam" was an excellent coverage 
for "business" purposes. It did not, however, address the reason for the trade 
embargo with the welfare of the Vietnamese people in mind. 
</P>
<P>
Due to loss of life suffered by the boat people who did not make it in addition 
to the cost of hard cash that the United States and other benevolent nations 
are contributing to care for those who made it, no profit from any business 
could be justified as long as Vietnam is still dotted with concentration camps 
and the people still risk their lives trying to escape. 
</P>
<P>
At a time when communism is collapsing or already collapsed in many countries, 
the Vietnamese people would be betrayed by any attempt to shore up the shaky 
Communist regime in Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
There is enough proof as unveiled recently that socialism, Marxist-style, does 
not benefit the people but just a small group of party members practicing 
totalitarian dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
The American ideal of freedom and pursuit of happiness should not be further 
strained by greed and the chase for a fast buck. There is plenty of business in 
the United States for the taker. A few more years of patient pressure will 
result in a Vietnam with freedom and democracy where people will take a boat 
out for fishing and not for escaping.

'TAGGER ARREST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In response to Robert A. Jones' column "Requiem for Chake" (Part A, Dec.18): 
</P>
<P>
It was irresponsible for The Times to publish Jones' inane accolade to a 
"tagger." There is a nauseating attitude of understanding in the article as 
Jones describes this graffiti writer as a sweet boy, with a great affection for 
his skateboard, whose acts of stealing paint have a "comic" aspect, and who is 
absorbed by a "quest." 
</P>
<P>
Perhaps, if the buildings in which Jones and his friends live and work were 
subjected to these acts of vandalisn, he might not have written this maudlin 
tribute to the destructive scrawlings of a teen-ager.

STATE INSURANCE CLAIMS, REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The supporters of Proposition 103 were foolish to believe that any action short 
of recalling insurance commissioner Roxani Gillespie would provide relief from 
rising insurance companies. Her lame-duck actions reveal that the system 
doesn't have checks and balances, rather it favors the checks that don't bounce 
and large insurance companies' account balances.

STATE INSURANCE CLAIMS, REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is very hard to understand why The Times would give so much space to the 
insurance industry's biased reports on auto accident injury claims ("State 
Leads Nation in Filing Injury Claims for Auto Accidents," Dec. 19). 
</P>
<P>
The reports were commissioned by major insurance carriers with no input from 
consumer groups. 
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the numbers are skewed to favor the insurance industry's 
position. Even in his own story Kenneth Reich points out that injury claims in 
no-fault states are counted differently than they are in liability states, such 
as California. Consequently, there may be even more claims in no-fault states, 
but only those injury claims over a certain dollar threshold are counted. In 
California, all claims paid are counted, no matter how small the dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
The California Trial Lawyers Assn. has always been an advocate of strict 
standards regarding fraudulent accident claims. In fact, last year we supported 
Assembly Bill 2315, which would have weeded out fraudulent claims. In 1991 we 
will again sponsor legislation to curb phony claims filed by individuals or 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
Every year the insurance industry seems to gift-wrap some new set of statistics 
it has devised to help bolster its ongoing crusade for no-fault auto insurance. 
Given the industry's long history of manipulating numbers, including rate 
setting, the report's conclusions shouldn't prove to difficult to debunk once 
unbiased research delves into them.

TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a recent edition, you printed a letter from a reader supporting Proposition 
140 and suggesting I also propose term limits on the Los Angeles County Board 
of Supervisors and create an elected county executive. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, in fact, I did bring a proposal to the board in support of 
term limits, but, not surprisingly, didn't even receive a second to the motion. 
</P>
<P>
I am told by county counsel that the Legislature would have to impose the 
limits, since state law precludes local boards of supervisors from establishing 
their own terms. I am hopeful, with the passage of 140, I can get enough 
support in the Legislature to impose such limits. 
</P>
<P>
I support term limits for all levels of government. 
</P>
<P>
I also agree that an elected county executive is needed. Again, I have not been 
able to get the support of my colleagues on the board to put the proposal on 
the ballot.

Parade Wars: KTTV Channel 11 sent KTLA Channel 5 three blank commercial 
cartridges, claiming that since it won't be running commercials during its Rose 
Parade coverage on New Year's Day, KTLA perhaps could use them. 
</P>
<P>
The stations have been sniping at each other in their on-air parade promos. 
KTTV says that it will be mentioning sponsors but won't run spots as such; KTLA 
cameras won't leave the parade but will use "see-through" overlay images of 
sponsors on the screen. The cartridges were sent by Greg Nathanson, president 
of the Fox Station Group, to Steve Bell, general manager of KTLA. A KTLA 
spokesman said he was amused by the free cartridges but that Bell was 
unavailable for comment. BETH KLEID

Clash in Chicago: Police and anti-war protesters clashed outside a Public Enemy 
rap concert in Chicago early Sunday, resulting in 18 arrests. 
</P>
<P>
Police reported that people ran across the street once the concert had ended, 
set up an anti-war banner and began yelling and throwing objects. Police said 
they asked the group to disperse but that protesters refused. Concertgoers had 
a different story. Witnesses said that police aggressively pulled down the 
banner and began arresting the protesters. A formal complaint about police 
handling of the incident has been filed. BETH KLEID

Seeing Double: Visitors to the corner of Broxton and Weyburn Avenues in 
Westwood Village will see the unusual sight of two movie theaters with the same 
film on their marquees: "The Godfather Part III." 
</P>
<P>
Both the Mann Village and Mann Bruin theaters, across the street from each 
other, are showing the Francis Ford Coppola film at the same time. Mann 
Theaters director of operations Ben Littlefield said that the success of the 
film at the 1,500-seat Village Theater since it opened on Christmas Day caused 
the theater chain to open the movie at the 800-seat Bruin. "It takes a dynamic 
film with a large demand to warrant that kind of treatment," Littlefield said.

KENNY G GIVES LONG-WINDED PERFORMANCE AT AMPHITHEATRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"The world's greatest living saxophonist . . . Kenny G!" 
</P>
<P>
 Incredibly, that was singer Michael Bolton's description of his partner during 
Friday's opening program of the duo's eight-night run at Universal 
Amphitheatre. 
</P>
<P>
But if Bolton's characterization seemed effusive in the extreme, it was no more 
overblown than the performance itself, which started late and ran on, 
interminably, past midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny G -- as he bills himself -- is clearly not an artist who has yet 
discovered the mature creative values of economy and conciseness. Every piece 
featured the same extended saxophone solos, variously on alto, tenor and 
soprano, all assembled from the same repetitious blues licks. 
</P>
<P>
With rare exception, the numbers all fell into similar patterns -- soft 
ensemble chording on the ballads, funk-driven rhythms on the tempo tunes -- and 
the soloing was interchangeable from one piece to another. 
</P>
<P>
G has discovered a growing fondness for the spotlight, and one that has 
flourished considerably since his last appearance in the area. Brief features 
for the members of his back-up ensemble were the only moments when the focus 
moved away from the saxophonist. And even then he appeared reluctant to leave 
center stage. 
</P>
<P>
Bassist Vail Johnson and guitarist John Raymond, for example, were obliged to 
share the opening part of their features via duets with G. Raymond's skills, 
modest at most, demanded no more space than they got. But Johnson, an 
explosively energetic performer, burst out of his exchanges with G into a 
colorful, stage-stalking, rhythm stomping solo that gave the saxophonist all 
the competition he could handle. A duet between drummer Bruce Carter and 
percussionist Ron Powell was too truncated to allow either performer to stretch 
out, and keyboardist Robert Damper had little opportunity to do anything other 
than solid support work. 
</P>
<P>
There was plenty of time, however, for G to stretch out. Twice he took 
long-winded solo excursions through the audience -- a pied piper with a 
portable microphone. Several numbers were dominated by the trickery of circular 
breathing techniques, which allowed him to hold notes and play patterns for 
seemingly impossible lengths of time. Others featured rapid-fire fingering that 
made his line sound as though it was being played by two instruments. 
</P>
<P>
But it was all circus stuff -- the kind of technical gimmickry most 
professional saxophonists learn early and quickly abandon in favor of richer 
forms of expression. Like the bar-walking saxophonists of the '50s and the 
heavy-metal lead guitarists who are his real models, G appeared more concerned 
with theater, with impression, with appearance, than with enriching the content 
of his music. 
</P>
<P>
Most of the program, in fact, had a prepackaged quality. G's exchanges with the 
audience -- overflowing with determinedly ingenuous nice guy smiles and "Oh 
wow, this is so fun!" and "I wish I could ask you all a bunch of questions, but 
I don't know what to say!" commentary -- sounded exactly like his remarks 
during last year's performances. 
</P>
<P>
Only Michael Bolton's opening set was different, enlarged no doubt due to his 
increased visibility as a solo artist. But his blue-eyed soul style -- 
especially on a classic like Otis Redding's "Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay" -- 
is an acquired taste, and one which requires almost complete ignorance of the 
more fruitful sources upon which it is based. 
</P>
<P>
Kenny G and Michael Bolton continue at the Amphitheatre tonight and Wednesday 
through Saturday. All performances except the final one are sold out.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'THE LONG WALK HOME' -- FOUR VIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
MOVIE BRINGS TO LIFE A WORLD OF BIGOTRY IN MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT ERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BALES, Bales is vice president of production for Vecchio Productions, 
which recently completed production of Oscar, an upcoming release with 
Sylvester Stallone. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was extremely disheartening to read the well-written but misguided review by 
Peter Rainer and commentary by Karl Fleming (Dec. 20) on the excellent new film 
"The Long Walk Home." 
</P>
<P>
Both writers objected to what they felt was misguided historical fact. Nowhere 
does this movie purport to be based on any specific incident or individual. 
Rather, it opts to fictionalize a story that brings to life the pool of 
unexhausted bigotry in Montgomery during the 1955 bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming actually seems so bitter that the story told in the film is not the one 
he personally recalls from his old journalism days at Newsweek that he is 
totally unable to grasp what a compelling drama this is to an audience without 
his individual experience. If critics wish to judge a movie based entirely on 
historical accuracy, they should in all fairness stick to reviewing documentary 
forms of filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
I did not feel that the whites in "The Long Walk Home" were candy-coated or 
sympathetic. They were portrayed as scared, narrow-minded and soulless. Even 
the character of Mrs. Thompson displayed all of these emotions and behaviors at 
times, and in the best of moments she was behaving as any decent human being 
should -- nothing more. Rising above others' prejudices does not create a hero, 
it simply shows an individual with understanding and compassion. 
</P>
<P>
I hope that The Times' articles do not turn people away from this film. Like 
most young Americans, I was reminded by "The Long Walk Home" of a time in our 
country's history, shortly before I was born, that I am often negligent in 
thinking about. 
</P>
<P>
It is clear to see that as 1991 begins, our laws have given minorities legal 
rights, but we as a nation are far from free in enjoying full human rights. 
This film is not only about 1955 -- but also about the present. It is a warm, 
yet strong, reminder about choices and about responsibility. That is something 
to be commended and rewarded and, hopefully, something we want to encourage 
others to participate in, not only in the make-believe world of film but in the 
reality of our daily existence.

A SLICE OF LIFE FROM ANOTHER TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY INNIS, Innis is executive director of the Congress of Racial Equality 
(CORE). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In today's world, unlike old biblical times, we do not "visit the sins of the 
parents onto the children"; but even if we should, we must be sure that the 
children are true descendants of the parents. "The Long Walk Home" is a fine 
creative effort; it is not a pretentious piece of revisionist history, as is 
"Mississippi Burning." It isolates a slice of life from a critical historical 
period, the Montgomery bus boycott. 
</P>
<P>
The film focuses on two main characters, two average Southern wives (one black 
and one white) of mid-1950s urban Alabama. The plot is developed around their 
intra- and inter-family dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
The key point here is that both of these families are typical for their racial 
and social groups in that society. Neither of them is driven sanctimoniously by 
high moral principles; they arrive at their final position of resistance and 
sacrifice through an evolutionary process. 
</P>
<P>
True, that process and the forces driving it are different for both of these 
ladies, but the significant point is that they arrive at the same place -- 
unwitting heroines in a fight against racism, cowardice and stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
This film does not try to exploit our senses. It appears to me that the makers 
of this movie did not want to subordinate the essence and message of their 
story to a cliche-driven work full of cheap excitement, as did "Mississippi 
Burning." 
</P>
<P>
In "The Long Walk Home," Odessa, played by Whoopi Goldberg, is a 
well-developed, sympathetic, noble character. Goldberg is a sensitive artist 
who has a deep understanding of the 1950s Southern black woman 
worker/housewife. She does not try to re-create the true historical role of 
Rosa Parks. That is left for another movie. 
</P>
<P>
Sissy Spacek's character (Miriam Thompson) is not the revolutionary Norma Rae 
-- that movie has already been done. Nor is she any of the heroic white women 
of CORE and other civil rights organizations who put their lives on the line 
driving black demonstrations during that era. 
</P>
<P>
Spacek plays well the part of a typical idle Southern white middle-class 
housewife, with no strong ideological position -- no better nor worse than 
anybody else in her class or racial group. Her evolution to a role as civil 
rights participant is arrived at through pragmatic necessities. The blatantly 
stupid, cowardly and racist resistance of her husband and brother-in-law helps 
to drive that evolution.

COUNTERPUNCH: 'THE LONG WALK HOME' -- FOUR VIEWS; 
</P>
<P>
KARL FLEMING MISSED THE POINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CORK, Cork, a native of Montgomery, Ala., is the screenwriter of The 
Long Walk Home. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
How does The Times have the audacity to run an article entitled "Bus Boycott: 
The Way It Really Was" by reporter Karl Fleming, who never covered Montgomery 
during the bus boycott? It is clear from Fleming's writing that he has little 
knowledge of Montgomery in 1955-56. Mainly, Fleming tries to tell us how "The 
Long Walk Home" misrepresents life in Montgomery, Ala., during the boycott. But 
it is Fleming who has to stoop to misrepresentations. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming questions a scene where a white Montgomery housewife, Miriam Thompson, 
has a white policeman apologize to a black maid, Odessa Cotter. Fleming states, 
"That a white Southern cop, or any white person, for that matter, would 
apologize to any black person for anything . . . is extremely unlikely in that 
era." 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's doubts do not change the fact that just such an apology was made in 
the mid-'50s in Montgomery -- for the reason cited in the film. What Fleming 
does not discuss is Miriam's rationale ("I will not have my judgment 
impugned"); Odessa's husband's very accurate assessment ("That policeman was 
apologizing to her (Miriam), not you"), and even the Montgomery police 
commissioner's reasons for sending the policeman out to apologize ("the police 
department has to keep its nose clean"). 
</P>
<P>
Fleming, as an experienced reporter, should be able to accurately report 
moments from the film. He writes: "At movie's end we see a threatened Mrs. 
Thompson and Odessa holding hands and silencing and facing down a raving mob of 
whites with only the quiet strength of their moral superiority." 
</P>
<P>
An interesting scene, but not one in the movie. Miriam Thompson never takes 
Odessa Cotter's hand. Odessa Cotter makes a choice to confront a potentially 
violent crowd -- and she does so alone. As others understand her action, she is 
joined by about 20 black women who use nonviolent resistance to face down a mob 
of whites. Miriam only watches. It becomes apparent that the whites, without 
the shield of robes or police badges, will not resort to violence -- for the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
After the immediate danger has passed, another woman -- not Odessa -- holds out 
a hand to Miriam. Odessa's reaction is far more questioning than accepting. 
Fleming does a grave injustice to the intent of the film to claim that Miriam 
is "the central heroic figure" in this scene or even the movie. The scene, the 
courage and the strength belong to Odessa. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming raises the issue of whites supporting the boycott. But what chance 
would Fleming give a socially prominent white woman from Montgomery sponsoring 
a noted interracial organization such as the Highlander Folk School? 
</P>
<P>
Not only did Virginia Durr offer sponsorship to the school, she recommended 
that a black seamstress spend a week at the school. The seamstress, according 
to Taylor Branch in "Parting the Waters," returned "to say that her eyes had 
been opened to new possibilities of harmony between the races." 
</P>
<P>
The seamstress was Rosa Parks. Virginia Durr and her husband Clifford went to 
the police station on Dec. 1, 1955, to post bail for Parks when she was 
arrested in the incident that sparked the boycott. White members of an 
interracial prayer group wrote signed letters to the paper in support. Many of 
these women would pick up and drive black women whom they saw walking during 
the boycott. Three men from Maxwell Air Force Base, along with the Rev. Robert 
Graetz and his wife, are cited by Martin Luther King Jr. as whites who drove 
for the black-run car-pool system. 
</P>
<P>
Fleming's questioning of even meeting with blacks ignores the fact that in 
1955, Alabama Gov. Jim Folsom sat in the governor's mansion in Montgomery and 
drank bourbon with black Congressman Adam Clayton Powell. That the meeting 
happened shows that the ironies of the times are far more interesting than 
Fleming may remember. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, Fleming is much more insidious in referring to the black characters as 
"background players." I could not disagree more. Maybe through Fleming's 
white-man eyes he could only see Miriam Thompson as significant. But that 
ignores the dramatic weight carried by Odessa Cotter. He takes her silence as a 
sign that she is "passive," yet she is the one who tells Miriam that she must 
have a modicum of respect, or she will "have to quit" her job as maid. She is 
the one who, by the end of the film, has found the strength to confront a 
racist mob in an act of courage exemplified by so many during the time. 
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Miriam Thompson is, as Sissy Spacek put it, "a woman who 
does all the right things for all the wrong reasons." However, it is through a 
slow realization brought on by her confrontations with Odessa that she finds 
herself politically on the other side of the fence from most of white 
Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
Does the fact that a lone sympathetic white character exists in "The Long Walk 
Home" make the film "about as far from reality as one could get"? No. The film 
centers around two fictional characters, and two fictional families. But all 
the background information is correct. Conversations, attitudes and social 
customs are accurately portrayed. As Rosa Parks herself stated, the film's 
"tone is right, the events could have happened." That is the test of good 
fiction. And this film should not be judged as a documentary. 
</P>
<P>
The film was shown in Montgomery on Dec. 2 -- 35 years to the day that leaflets 
were distributed calling for the boycott. A crowd of blacks and whites 
attended, and the response was very emotional. Many in the theater had been 
part of the historical fabric that the story relies upon. Some had been (and 
still are) members of the board of the Montgomery Improvement Assn., the 
organization created to manage the boycott. The applause meant more to me than 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
The following night, I attended a meeting celebrating the 35th anniversary of 
the organization at the Holt Street Baptist Church. I came as an observer but 
was asked to sit behind the pulpit and even speak to those gathered. 
</P>
<P>
Later, Mrs. Johnnie Carr, the president of the group, and a very active member 
during the boycott, spoke. She said, "I don't know if you or John knows how 
remarkable it is that he is here today. How remarkable it is that he could have 
written 'The Long Walk Home.' " 
</P>
<P>
In so few words, she managed to bring forth the arc of history for me. The 
remarkable thing was not that I, a white boy from the other side of town, was 
in a black church, but that I was exactly where I wanted to be. Exactly where 
Carr wanted me to be. I had not helped her or any of the others present gain 
civil rights, respect or a sense of self-worth. The opposite was true. Carr 
provided me with the illumination. . . just as the fictional black maid, 
Odessa, did for the fictional white housewife in "The Long Walk Home." 
</P>
<P>
And that is exactly the point that Fleming missed.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: GERMAN CINEMA 'FROM CALIGARI TO HITLER'; 
</P>
<P>
THE FIRST PART OF THE ART MUSEUM'S SURVEY COVERS FILMS MADE BEFORE 1933 THAT 
WERE SUBSEQUENTLY BANNED BY THE NAZIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Rare films from Hitler's Third Reich will be among those shown during "From 
Caligari to Hitler," a two-part series surveying German cinema from 1913-1945 
that gets under way Friday at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Bing 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
The series complements the museum's upcoming "Degenerate Art: The Fate of the 
Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany," which runs Feb. 17 through May 12. 
</P>
<P>
Part 1 (Friday-Jan. 26) is composed of films made before Hitler came to power 
in 1933; all were subsequently denounced and banned by the Nazi regime. Part 2 
(Feb.1-March 4) covers the key films of the Third Reich, which have not been 
seen in 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
The series' title comes from Siegfried Kracauer's fascinating, hotly debated 
1947 history of the German cinema, in which he argues dogmatically -- and with 
varying degrees of persuasiveness -- that the coming of Hitler and Nazism was 
foreshadowed in Germany's movies. 
</P>
<P>
The series opens with screenings at 1 p.m. and again at 8 p.m. of Walther 
Ruttman's abstract 12-minute "Light-Play Opus No. 1" (1921), and "The Cabinet 
of Dr. Caligari" (1919). The latter, one of the most famous and influential 
silent films, ushered in the golden age of the German cinema. With its boldly 
innovative Expressionist style, "Caligari," which was directed by Robert Wiene, 
an otherwise obscure experimentalist, projects powerfully -- and prophetically 
-- a vision of society as an insane asylum under the rule of a clever and evil 
madman. 
</P>
<P>
The world of "Caligari" is that of a nightmare in which highly stylized 
settings, a jumble of bizarre angles and forced perspectives, represents the 
distorted vision of the film's narrator, a distraught young man named Francis 
(Friedrich Feher). He tells a horrifying tale of an evil-looking magician, Dr. 
Caligari (Werner Krauss), who arrives in the fictional town of Holstenwall with 
a carnival. 
</P>
<P>
Caligari's magic act consists of Cesare the Somnambulist (a cadaverous-looking 
Conrad Veidt), who upon being wakened in his upright coffin -- the "cabinet" of 
the film's title -- makes predictions based on questions from the audience. 
Clearly, Cesare is in Caligari's thrall. Meanwhile, Holstenwall is struck by a 
series of murders. 
</P>
<P>
Scheduling conflicts prevented Fritz Lang from directing "Caligari," but he is 
credited with providing the film's framing story, which adds a profoundly 
disturbing dimension to Carl Mayer and Hans Janowitz's script. 
</P>
<P>
Screening at 2:30 p.m. and again at 9:30 p.m. is Ernst Lubitsch's enchanting 
1919 "Madame Du Barry" (released in the United States as "Passion"). It offers 
a sly, boudoir view of history; a radiant Pola Negri plays Du Barry to Emil 
Jannings' petulant, ungainly Louis XV. In the immediate wake of World War I, 
the French were so taken aback by this sophisticated, though tragic, romp that 
they banned it for five years. Meanwhile, its stars and director went on to 
Hollywood and even greater fame and glory. 
</P>
<P>
Saturday brings (at 8 p.m. only) a trio of rarities, starting with the 
75-minute first (1913) version of "The Student of Prague," directed by Stellan 
Rye and produced by and starring the burly Paul Wegener as "Prague's finest 
swordsman and wildest student." 
</P>
<P>
The title character sells his soul to a satanic magician in this imaginative 
and poignant variation on "The Picture of Dorian Gray"; in the 1925 remake, 
Wegener would be more aptly cast as the tempter opposite Conrad Veidt as the 
student. 
</P>
<P>
It is followed by Richard Oswald's elegant and sensitive "Different From the 
Others" (1919), which the late gay activist/film historian Vito Russo declared 
to be the first film to advocate gay rights. It also is the first to depict a 
gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
With his usual intensity, Conrad Veidt plays a famed concert violinist who 
courageously stands up to a blackmailer. This enlightened film stirred up a 
considerable controversy and was subsequently banned. 
</P>
<P>
Concluding Saturday's program is a real stunner, the 60-minute "Backstairs" 
(1921), written by Carl Mayer and directed by Leopold Jessner. Against Paul 
Leni's looming, shadowy settings -- the print is razor-sharp and mint-fresh -- 
they tell with the utmost economy and psychological impact of the obsessive 
love of an unprepossessing postman (Fritz Kortner) for a pretty housemaid 
(Henny Porten) with a tall, handsome lover (Wilhelm Dieterle, later a prominent 
Hollywood director).

SURVEY OF IMPRESSIONISM, CALIFORNIA STYLE; 
</P>
<P>
LAGUNA ART MUSEUM HANGS 75 HO-HUM PAINTINGS. BUT THE EXHIBIT CATALOGUE HELPS 
RELIEVE THE DOLDRUMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
There have been moments in history when a group of creative visionaries put 
their hometown on the cultural map. More commonly, provincial art styles 
beloved by the locals never make the big time, and for good reason. So-called 
"California Impressionism" is one of those styles, a timidly conservative 
attempt to capture the look of a coastal Shangri-La using techniques pioneered 
by artists in France more than a generation earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Granted the continuing public popularity of these paintings, a critic groans at 
the prospect of yet another show devoted to uninspired images of breezy shores, 
rugged mountains and dreamily idle women. The "masters" of this genre hardly 
seem worth differentiating from each other, and they scarcely suffer from 
underexposure. 
</P>
<P>
So why is the Laguna Art Museum bringing us "California Light: 1900-1930," an 
array of 75 works by nine of these artists? 
</P>
<P>
Well, initially it seemed as if the exhibit (on view through Jan. 6) was going 
to offer a fresh, broadly sociological look at the connection between the art 
and the sun-dazzled land that was rapidly filling up with newcomers lured by 
tourist brochures. Even ho-hum art can be wonderfully informative about the 
habits and beliefs of people living at a particular time. 
</P>
<P>
The catalogue essays by 10 authors with expertise in a variety of fields do 
cover a good deal of ground, from the phenomenon of migration to Southern 
California to the way certain artists glorified a vision of passive femininity. 
Yet guest curator Patricia Trenton seems to be bringing us the same old show, 
livened up with a few informational tidbits about the unique whiteness of 
California light. 
</P>
<P>
Strolling through the exhibit, you don't feel you are in the midst of a 
revisionist effort, or even a concerted effort to relate art to life. 
Conventional documentation of the careers of the artists -- most of whom also 
worked abroad and back East -- tends to cloud the issue of how the art 
responded to the social and cultural climate of California. There are no 
contemporary photographs to give a sense of context, no relevant wall-text 
discussions of, say, the emphasis on light and color in what passed for 
critical writing on art in Southern California or the amount of leisure time 
enjoyed by upper-class women of the period. 
</P>
<P>
The paintings -- by Franz Bischoff, Maurice Braun, Alson Clark, Joseph 
Kleitsch, Edgar Payne, Granville Redmond, Guy Rose, Donna Schuster and William 
Wendt -- are grouped for the most part by artist. A separate gallery is set 
aside for works painted in Europe by Rose, Clark and Payne, presumably to 
indicate the different kinds of light they found in Madrid, Paris, Switzerland 
and Giverny, where aging Impressionist Claude Monet held court. 
</P>
<P>
Although California Impressionism marked the last hurrah of plein-air painting 
-- done out-of-doors to capture instantaneous effects at the source -- the 
Californians went their own independent ways, frequently distorting or 
modifying the working habits and theories of their French artistic forebears. 
</P>
<P>
Edgar Payne, for example, was really an academic painter in Impressionist's 
clothing. He stayed indoors to paint detailed models of fishing boats in 
Impressionist-style broken brushwork, and carefully recomposed his outdoor 
sketches of mountains into idealized visions rather than trying to capture the 
fleeting quality of optical sensations. 
</P>
<P>
Actually, quite a few of the works on view are scenes of light held at bay by 
parasols and porticoes or filtered into indoor settings. Based on the evidence 
in these canvases, the only people who took shelter under a roof in California 
were women. With a few exceptions -- such as Kleitsch's portrait of 
self-possessed "Miss Ketchum" -- these lasses were a droopy lot, given to vague 
reveries in pretty gowns amid the tasteful furnishings of a prosperous home. 
</P>
<P>
Frequently, as in Clark's "Reflections" -- a semi-nude image of a young thing 
staring smugly at her manicure -- the woman poses near a mirror but doesn't 
look into it. The mirror, like the woman, is really there for the spectator's 
pleasure in sensual accouterments. 
</P>
<P>
As Bram Dijkstra, professor of American literature and cultural history at UC 
San Diego, discusses at length in a catalogue essay, in turn-of-the-century 
painting, a woman was "a clever optical illusion . . . lit only by the 
reflected light of the masculine sun . . . a mere echo of creativity." 
</P>
<P>
Such insights and turns of phrase rescue the exhibit from the doldrums; if only 
the same could be said of the paintings themselves.

Hundreds of Albanians streamed across the Greek border Sunday in what may be 
the biggest one-day exodus since Albania's Communist government promised 
democratic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in the Greek border village of Filiates said it appeared 
that the Albanian government had opened its mountainous frontier with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no other explanation," he said. "A mosquito couldn't get across 
the border before." 
</P>
<P>
At least 500 Albanians arrived on Sunday, and all were seeking political 
asylum, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It looks like there are whole villages crossing -- it's a madhouse up here," 
the police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
"Our police station has become a refugee center," he added. "We don't know what 
to do with all these people." 
</P>
<P>
In Albania, meanwhile, an official spokesman indicated that for the first time 
in decades, Albanian Jews are being allowed to emigrate to Israel or elsewhere. 
Vladimir Prela, head of the Albanian Foreign Ministry's press office, said: "If 
they want to live in Israel, they can do so." 
</P>
<P>
Prela, reached in the Albanian capital, Tirana, by telephone from Vienna, did 
not confirm reports that a plan for the emigration of about 500 Albanian Jews 
has been worked out by Jewish groups or governments in the West. 
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Jews were being allowed to leave under a general easing of 
restrictions on travel abroad for all Albanians. He estimated that there are 
about 1,000 Jews in the tiny Balkan nation of 3.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
So far this month, more than 1,000 people have fled into Greece along the 
countries' frontier. Most have been ethnic Greeks, and they are automatically 
granted political asylum. 
</P>
<P>
Border police officers said they had reports that about 3,000 more Albanians 
are expected to try to cross the 100-mile border area by tonight. 
</P>
<P>
Refugees who are not ethnic Greeks and not eligible for immediate political 
asylum were to be bused to the U.N. Lavrion refugee center, 40 miles southeast 
of Athens. 
</P>
<P>
Albania became a hard-line Stalinist state at the end of World War II, and it 
has only recently started to adopt democratic reforms embraced by other Eastern 
European countries last year.

RAIDERS' VICTORY IS FRIESZ-FRAMED; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: AFTER LEADING MUCH OF THE GAME BEHIND THEIR ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, 
THE CHARGERS FALL, 17-12, TO FINISH 6-10 FOR THE THIRD CONSECUTIVE SEASON.

<P>
The tradition continues: The Chargers' commitment to finish 6-10 and lose games 
by the narrowest of margins. 
</P>
<P>
What comes after three-peat? For the third year in a row the Chargers have 
finished 6-10, and for the 14th time in the past two seasons they have been 
defeated by seven or fewer points. 
</P>
<P>
Sunday they went to the wire with the Raiders only to fall back in the fourth 
quarter, 17-12, in front of 64,445 fans in the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
The victory earned the Raiders (12-4) their first AFC West Division crown since 
1985 and a first-week bye in the playoffs. It was also the Raiders' 14th 
victory in their last 18 meetings with the Chargers, who haven't been to the 
playoffs since 1982. 
</P>
<P>
"It wasn't the prettiest game," Raiders Coach Art Shell said. "But we did today 
what champions have to do: Find a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers' search for success, meanwhile, drags on and on. Week-to-week, 
it's how are they going to lose? What's going to go wrong? Who's going to make 
the mistake that turns victory into defeat? 
</P>
<P>
They were ahead 12-10 in the fourth quarter, and they were 11:36 away from 
completing an upset that would have made the Kansas City Chiefs division champs 
and the Raiders a wild-card entrant. The Chargers had the league's No. 6-ranked 
defense, and they had the Raiders pinned back on their own 20-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"There it is again; we got that close," said General Manager Bobby Beathard, 
"and couldn't finish it off." 
</P>
<P>
There it is: The story of disappointment in both 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders went 80 yards in 11 plays, and with 3:53 remaining scored on Jay 
Schroeder's 17-yard pass to a wide open Steve Smith. 
</P>
<P>
How? What? Who? 
</P>
<P>
"It was the perfect play against the defense we had called," linebacker Billy 
Ray Smith explained. "It's one of those one in a thousand calls." 
</P>
<P>
They caught the Chargers in a linebacker blitz and sent Smith out for a pass. 
</P>
<P>
"They really did a great job on me by sucking me in," Chargers linebacker 
Junior Seau said. "It was my man and I felt bad. It was my fault they got it." 
</P>
<P>
When the Chargers got the ball back they also had 80 yards to go. But they had 
rookie John Friesz at quarterback, and he had the benefit of one two-minute 
drill in practice on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
"That's the first time I've run the two-minute offense live," said Friesz, 
after completing 11 of 22 for 98 yards with a touchdown and interception in his 
NFL debut. "The defense was just standing there when I ran it in practice. It 
wasn't like what the Raiders did." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers advanced to the San Diego 43 in their two-minute offense, but then 
were shoved back 10 yards on tackle Broderick Thompson's penalty for holding. 
They made it back again to the Los Angeles 46, but then Raiders defensive 
lineman Scott Davis sacked Friesz for a seven-yard loss. 
</P>
<P>
With a timeout and a third and 17 from the San Diego 47, Friesz was instructed 
to look deep for Anthony Miller. But he chose to go to tight end Arthur Cox, 
who was tackled for a gain of six yards. 
</P>
<P>
With the team's final timeout and 51 seconds to play, Friesz was told to go to 
Miller deep again on fourth and 11. But he felt pressure in the pocket, rolled 
right and dribbled a pass in front of Nate Lewis, who was positioned short of 
the first-down marker. 
</P>
<P>
And that was it for the Chargers in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
"He just showed signs of youth," quarterbacks coach Ted Tollner said. "They 
didn't double Anthony; they played a zone defense. We told him we got two shots 
at it and we're going to try and get the ball upfield to our best player. 
</P>
<P>
"But he flushed (from the pocket) on one because of pressure, and made a poor 
decision on on the other. In either case, you're not going to make a first 
down." 
</P>
<P>
Friesz took the Chargers the length of the field to open the game, but on 
fourth and one from the one, Coach Dan Henning elected to take a 3-0 lead on 
John Carney's 19-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Although Schroeder didn't complete his first pass of the game until there were 
less than two minutes left in the half, the Raiders advanced to the San Diego 
five-yard line on a controversial pass interference call against Charger 
defensive back Sam Seale. 
</P>
<P>
Seale appeared to have textbook coverage on Willie Gault, but as Gault 
attempted to catch Schroeder's pass, there was contact between receiver and 
defender. A flag was thrown, the Chargers argued and the Raiders moved into 
position to score. 
</P>
<P>
On third and one, Marcus Allen took his patented dive into the end zone for a 
7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers retaliated with Rod Bernstine and Ronnie Harmon. Bernstine, who 
finished with a career-high 114 yards on 27 carries, bulled his way up the 
middle, and Harmon, who ran for 53 yards on five carries, went wide. 
</P>
<P>
After Bernstine and Harmon put the Chargers in scoring position at the Los 
Angeles seven-yard line, Friesz fired a touchdown pass to tight end Craig 
McEwen. Friesz impressed the brass on the play by moving from his first choice 
and to his second choice before settling on McEwen, his third read on the play. 
</P>
<P>
Carney's extra-point attempt, however, was blocked, and the Chargers settled 
for a 9-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless third quarter, which included Carney's short field-goal 
effort from 54 yards, the Raiders went ahead 10-9 on Jeff Jaeger's 45-yard 
line-drive field goal. 
</P>
<P>
Jaeger's ensuing kickoff was returned 90 yards to the Los Angeles seven-yard 
line by Donnie Elder. Elder was caught from behind by Raiders' safety Dan Land, 
thereby forcing the Chargers' offense to try and go the final seven yards for 
the score. 
</P>
<P>
Friesz's third-down pass from the three, however, was batted down at the line 
of scrimmage, and Carney was called on to kick a 21-yard field goal for a 12-10 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't feel good about the wins and losses," Beathard said. "But I think 
we've made progress. . . . I think we're a better team. But I wish the progress 
we had made had translated into more than six wins. 
</P>
<P>
"I think if you asked the players they can play with the best in this division 
(Raiders). I think our record shows and the way we have lost some of the games 
that we can play with them, but we haven't been good enough to beat them. 
</P>
<P>
"We feel on a par with those guys, but there's something we have to do between 
now and next season to be able to prove it." 
</P>
<P>
In other words: Wait until next year. Again.

NBA ROUNDUP;

<P>
BUCKS STAY UNBEATEN AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
The Milwaukee Bucks are the Rodney Dangerfield of the NBA. Although they keep 
doing quite well, they don't get much respect. 
</P>
<P>
Even Sunday night when they held off the powerful Portland Trail Blazers, 
117-112, for their 15th consecutive victory at home, it was downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, losing for only the fourth time in 31 games, were tired. 
They were playing their fourth game in five nights on a trip East that began on 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Rick Adelman and his players were angry because they had to fly cross 
country to New York instead of spending the holiday with their families. They 
took their anger out on the Knicks, Charlotte and Cleveland and Milwaukee -- 
for a while. 
</P>
<P>
The Blazers led, 76-74, with three minutes left in the third quarter when Ricky 
Pierce, who had 31 points in 31 minutes as a substitute, led a 16-5 surge that 
put Milwaukee ahead, 90-81. 
</P>
<P>
Pierce had four of the Bucks' 12 three-point baskets in a game in which there 
were a record 21 three-pointers by the two teams. The previous mark was 20, set 
on Feb. 9, 1989 by Sacramento and Golden State. The Kings had an NBA record 16 
three-pointers in that game. 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers had one run left in the fourth quarter. They fought back to 
tie, 108-108. But Pierce sank a jump shot and Clyde Drexler missed two free 
throws with 1:38 left. Frank Brickowski made two free throws, and the Portland 
rally fell short. 
</P>
<P>
Although the Bucks, the only team that hasn't lost at home, lead the tough 
Central Division with a 21-8 record, nobody believes Del Harris's team is 
really that good. 
</P>
<P>
The Bucks, who have had problems on the road, beat the New York Knicks Saturday 
night at New York. 
</P>
<P>
Charles Oakley, an angry Knick, said, "The Bucks are not really a powerhouse, 
but they play well together." 
</P>
<P>
Adelman said that the schedulemaker, if he wanted the Trail Blazers to play on 
the road the day after Christmas, should have sent them to nearby Seattle. But 
he wouldn't use the trip as the excuse for the Blazers' third road loss in 15 
games. 
</P>
<P>
"It was their deadly shooting from outside that beat us," he said. "Even the 
way they were shooting, we had a chance to win it. I'm proud of the way this 
team battled. We came back from 12 points in the last quarter to tie. We didn't 
have anything left." 
</P>
<P>
The Trail Blazers, who are runaway leaders of the Pacific Division, return home 
to play the Lakers Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota 126, Seattle 106 -- The Timberwolves ended a seven-game losing streak 
with their finest offensive performance. The previous record was 125 points in 
overtime against Philadelphia early last season. 
</P>
<P>
The Timberwolves, the poorest shooting team in the league, had a string of 
eight consecutive baskets in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
The SuperSonics, looking weary in their third road game in four nights, lost 
their second in a row after winning six in a row. DAN HAFNER

CLIPPERS FEEL HEAT AGAIN, LOSING TO MIAMI FOR SIXTH TIME IN A ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Sherman Douglas scored 25 points and Glen Rice and Kevin Edwards had 24 each to 
lead the Miami Heat from 15 points down in the third quarter to a 112-97 
victory over the Clippers Sunday night at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
As 1990 fades away, it keeps leaving familiar reminders. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers have lost six in a row to Miami, dating back three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers, who got 21 points from Ken Norman and Benoit Benjamin, are 11-18. 
Miami is 8-21. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had nine field goals the entire second half, compared to 21 for 
the Heat. 
</P>
<P>
"We put the pressure on them, and they didn't really respond to it," Douglas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers had a season-high 27 turnovers, 16 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
The Sports Arena is one of only three spots in the league where the Heat has a 
winning record, the others being Charlotte (2-1) and Minnesota (1-0). What 
makes coming to this arena extra special, beyond being 4-0 after Sunday, is 
that it's the site of the first victory in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
Since that December night two years ago, the Clippers have dropped another five 
in a row overall to the Heat. Among those is a 126-91 plastering last Feb. 2 in 
Florida, still the biggest margin of victory ever for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
Most Clippers are well aware of such numbers. And of how much the Heat must 
enjoy seeing them. 
</P>
<P>
"We have heard them say it the last two years," Norman said before Sunday's 
game, one of only two times the teams will face each other now that Miami has 
been realigned into the Eastern Conference. "They've said they know if they 
can't beat anybody, at least they know they can beat the Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
Ouch. 
</P>
<P>
"They're such a physical team," Norman said. "I know that's the reason (for the 
Clipper troubles). And they have no respect for us. None. They've even said 
it." 
</P>
<P>
The talk going in this time was about the sudden subtraction of firepower -- 
physical and otherwise. The Heat played without center Rony Seikaly, fast 
developing into one of the league's young stars but out at least three weeks 
with a sprained ligament in his right knee, and rookie swingman Willie Burton, 
who bruised his back Saturday at Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
But the Sports Arena is the wrong place to look for sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
Benjamin took advantage of Seikaly's absence to start a Clipper second-quarter 
run that turned a one-point lead into double digits in the last five minutes 
before halftime. The Clippers were up, 41-40, when Jeff Martin sunk a jump shot 
from the right side, and Benjamin, continuing his solid play while regaining 
strength after missing eight games following oral surgery, followed that with 
three consecutive baskets inside. One was followed by a free throw for a 
three-point play. 
</P>
<P>
That gave the Clippers a 50-42 cushion, en route to 57-44 with 21 seconds left 
in the second quarter and finally 57-46 at halftime. Benjamin had 15 points by 
then, as did Miami's Rice. 
</P>
<P>
The Clippers even opened the third quarter with two baskets, pushing their lead 
to 61-46 before the bottom dropped out, as if there was much bottom under teams 
that had lost nine of 11 (Clippers) and 12 of 14 (Heat) coming in. 
</P>
<P>
A 14-0 charge that turned into 22-2 gave Miami a 68-63 lead with 5:43 remaining 
in the third quarter. The Clippers had only five shots in that stretch and only 
one basket, Martin's jump shot from the left side with 7:30 left. Coach Mike 
Schuler called only one timeout. 
</P>
<P>
In all, the Heat outscored the Clippers, 31-16, in the third quarter and had a 
77-73 advantage heading into the final 12 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
Charles Smith did not dress for the second consecutive game, hoping the rest 
will heal his bruised left thigh from a Dec. 11 collision at Minnesota before 
the Clippers open an Eastern road swing Wednesday at Atlanta. "It'll be all 
right," said Smith, the team's second-leading scorer at 21.5 points. "We're 
taking care of it. It's finally time to rest it. It has been two weeks like 
this, so we need to get it done."

OILERS BEAT STEELERS, SLIDE INTO PLAYOFFS;

AFC: BACKUP CODY CARLSON PASSES FOR 247 YARDS AND THREE TOUCHDOWNS IN 34-14 
VICTORY.

<P>
So much for Warren Moon's dislocated thumb -- at least for now. 
</P>
<P>
With Cody Carlson doing a perfect imitation of their injured Pro Bowl 
quarterback, the Houston Oilers ran and shot their way into the NFL playoffs 
Sunday night by beating Pittsburgh, 34-14, and brought Cincinnati in with them. 
</P>
<P>
In this season of falling quarterbacks, that made Houston the fourth team 
entering the playoffs with a backup. But like Frank Reich of Buffalo and Jeff 
Hostetler of the New York Giants, Carlson was nearly as good as the injured 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a blur at first," said Carlson, who completed 22 of 29 for 247 yards 
and three touchdowns. "I'd never been in a game of this magnitude before, but 
after the first three completions, I settled down. The plays that were called 
were just right." 
</P>
<P>
Of Carlson, Coach Jack Pardee said: "I thought he'd do that. He was untested, 
but he has the ability." 
</P>
<P>
Carlson and the Oilers riddled a defense that hadn't allowed a touchdown in its 
last three games and entered the game ranked first in the league. Lorenzo White 
rushed for 90 yards behind a revised offensive line as part of a 195-yard 
rushing attack that helped knock the Steelers and Seattle out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"That the running game went so well took a lot of pressure off me," Carlson 
said. "Nobody expected that." 
</P>
<P>
But Carlson got his share of the credit, with Moon leading the cheers from the 
sideline. 
</P>
<P>
"It came down to the last game of the year and I certainly would have liked to 
be in there," Moon said. "But Cody came in and did a perfect job. He was really 
riding high." 
</P>
<P>
After missing a field goal early, the Oilers scored on five straight 
possessions. They took a 24-0 halftime lead as Carlson completed 16 of 21 
passes for 156 yards, running up 264 yards in the half against a team that had 
allowed just 246 a game. Their only punt came with just more than two minutes 
gone in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"They beat us running and they beat us passing," Pittsburgh Coach Chuck Noll 
said. "Obviously, we didn't play as well as we're capable as playing." 
</P>
<P>
The results left Houston, Cincinnati and Pittsburgh tied at 9-7 in the Central, 
with Seattle of the AFC West also 9-7. 
</P>
<P>
The Bengals claimed the Central Division title because they had the best 
intra-division record at 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
Houston won the final wild card over the Steelers and Seahawks because its 
conference record of 8-4 is the best of the three. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers will play next week in Cincinnati, where they lost, 40-20, last 
week, when Moon dislocated his right thumb. 
</P>
<P>
That injury was supposed to give the Oilers little chance to make the playoffs 
for a fourth straight season, a streak currently bettered only by San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
But Carlson, making just the sixth start of his four-year career, provided a 
lesson in the run-and-shoot offense that was close to the best of Moon, who had 
4,689 yards in 15 games. That included a 527-yard game against Kansas City that 
was the second-best in NFL history. 
</P>
<P>
He had a 14-yard touchdown pass to Ernest Givins, a three-yarder to Drew Hill, 
then hit Haywood Jeffires for 53 yards in the third quarter after Pittsburgh 
had scored on its first possession. White ran one yard for the first score. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be hard to beat that, particularly in a game this big," Pardee said. 
"I don't think they stopped us for most of the game, except for that missed 
field goal." 
</P>
<P>
The defense, meanwhile, controlled Bubby Brister and the Pittsburgh offense. 
Brister finished 15 of 26 for 240 yards, most of that when the game was out of 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers, who had 18 plays to one for Pittsburgh in the first 10 minutes, 
missed a chance on their first possession when Teddy Garcia missed a 50-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
But rookie linebacker Lamar Lathon knocked the ball loose from Tim Worley on 
Pittsburgh's first play and John Grimsley recovered at the 36. Eight plays 
later, on fourth down, White went in from the one for the first touchdown in 15 
quarters against the Steelers' defense. 
</P>
<P>
The Oilers made it 14-0 in the second period with an 80-yard, eight-play drive 
capped by Carlson's 14-yard pass to Givins, the first touchdown pass in four 
games against Pittsburgh, which had allowed just six all year. Givins' 31-yard 
run on a reverse put the Oilers into scoring position. 
</P>
<P>
Again came the Oilers, this time 68 yards in 10 plays, with Carlson hitting 
Hill in the back of the end zone from the three, and the rout was on.

JETS RUN PAST THE BUCCANEERS, 16-14

TAMPA, Fla. 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The New York Jets utilized a ground attack to stop a five-game losing streak, 
so they stuck with it and ended the season with consecutive wins. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets ran for 155 yards Sunday during a 16-14 victory over the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
The Jets' victory came a week after they rushed for 239 yards in a win over New 
England. 
</P>
<P>
"By the middle of the third quarter, we went back to last week's game plan," 
Jet Coach Bruce Coslet said. "We played them real tough. That was a pretty 
decent team we just beat. 
</P>
<P>
"This gives us something to build off for next year." 
</P>
<P>
Blair Thomas, the second pick in last spring's draft, gained 43 yards in six 
carries and scored his first rushing touchdown for the Jets, who finished with 
a 6-10 record in Coslet's first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay (6-10) lost eight of its last 10 games, including two of three under 
interim Coach Richard Williamson, who probably saw the end of his bid to 
replace Ray Perkins on a permanent basis. 
</P>
<P>
Williamson, who has guided the club since Perkins was fired Dec. 3, said he 
expects to meet soon with owner Hugh Culverhouse. He would not speculate on his 
chances of getting the job. 
</P>
<P>
"I told the players that whatever happens in the future, that you've got to 
believe you're going to be good," Williamson said. "I believe they're going to 
have a bright future -- they're right on the edge." 
</P>
<P>
Pat Leahy kicked field goals of 21 and 32 yards and Thomas scored on a 
five-yard run after Ron Stallworth recovered a fumble at Tampa Bay's 35 to give 
the Jets a 13-7 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
Leahy added a 25-yard field goal with less than a minute left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Tampa Bay sputtered offensively after Vinny Testaverde completed five of six 
passes for 69 yards during a 72-yard touchdown drive in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Reggie Cobb scored on a one-yard run for a 7-3 lead, but the Buccaneers did not 
reach the end zone again until just 3:32 remained. 
</P>
<P>
"Today's game, I think, summed up the whole season," said Testaverde, who 
completed 19 of 27 passes for 204 yards and rushed for 51 yards in five 
carries. "We had our bright spots, we had our miscues. It sums up the whole 
season in one game because you could see how it unraveled as it went along." 
</P>
<P>
Tony Stargell and Erik McMillan intercepted passes for the Jets in the second 
half, and the Jets sacked Testaverde three times. 
</P>
<P>
Bruce Hill caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Testaverde that drew the 
Buccaneers to within 16-14 with 3:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
But Johnny Hector gained 11 yards on first down on the Jets' ensuing 
possession, then Tony Eason sustained the drive with a 31-yard, third-down 
completion to Dale Dawkins that enabled the Jets to run out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
Eason played the fourth quarter after Ken O'Brien, who completed 11 of 19 
passes for 102 yards, left the game with a slight concussion sustained on a 
quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
"I was on the ground and took a hit to the head. . . . I'm OK now," said 
O'Brien, who was shaken up late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
"This is a great win. We really needed this. I wish the season went on for 
another few weeks. We're getting better." 
</P>
<P>
Freeman McNeil gained 43 yards in nine carries for the Jets.

Steve Young, understudy to Joe Montana, used a Montana script to rally the San 
Francisco 49ers to a 20-17 victory over the Minnesota Vikings Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Young, who relieved Montana in the second half, teamed with John Taylor on a 
34-yard touchdown pass play with 29 seconds left to enable the 49ers to finish 
the regular season 14-2, the best record in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
Montana has led countless comebacks. Last week, Young had the chance, but the 
49ers lost, 13-10, to New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Minnesota Coach Jerry Burns wasn't surprised by Young's heroics Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
"It epitomizes the whole season. We had our chance to win the game and we 
couldn't stop them," Burns said. "I just had a premonition they'd go right down 
and score and we wouldn't stop them. The secondary play was sick. The pass 
rush. The whole thing. 
</P>
<P>
"They know how to win and this team doesn't. Anytime you win you can feed off 
that success. You know that, in the past, you've come back and won games. This 
team hasn't done it." 
</P>
<P>
NFC Central champions last season, the Vikings (6-10) finished in last place 
for the first time since 1984. They ended the season with a four-game losing 
streak. 
</P>
<P>
"You really have to be scratching to find anything positive," Burns said. "When 
I saw that guy shoot that gun at the end, that was the most positive thing I 
saw." 
</P>
<P>
While Burns' most frustrating season finally ended, the 49ers will now begin 
concentrating on the playoffs in an effort to become the first NFL team to win 
three consecutive Super Bowls and five overall. 
</P>
<P>
"I had a decent day and I'm glad I've had the opportunity to catch 100 balls," 
said 49er receiver Jerry Rice, who caught nine passes for 118 yards and became 
the fourth player ever to reach the 100-reception mark in a season. "I think 
that's something to be proud of, but I'm just looking forward to the first 
playoff game." 
</P>
<P>
The 49ers' 18th consecutive road victory extended their own league record. 
However, they won't enjoy the "road-field advantage" in the playoffs, having 
clinched home-field throughout the playoffs two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco Coach George Seifert said the victory wasn't insignificant. 
"Coming into the playoffs, winning the game instead of losing, allows us to 
have pride in ourselves," he said. 
</P>
<P>
San Francisco, which won 15 games in 1984 and 14 in 1989 and went on to win the 
Super Bowl those years, used victories over Minnesota to springboard to its 
last three championships. The Vikings' last three seasons have ended with 
losses to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
As he had planned to do before the game, Seifert started Montana and used Young 
for the entire second half. Montana completed 10 of 20 passes for 88 yards and 
had one pass intercepted as the 49ers trailed, 10-0, and had a scoreless first 
half for the first time since Dec. 17, 1989 against Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
Young sparked the 49ers with his passing and scrambling. He was 15 of 24 for 
205 yards passing and added 59 yards in six rushes. 
</P>
<P>
On the winning drive, Young completed six of seven passes for 88 yards and also 
had a two-yard dive on fourth-and-one. Ken Stills was the closest Minnesota 
player to Taylor when he caught Young's pass at the 16 and went untouched into 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a play that takes a while to develop," Young said. "I told the guys in 
the huddle that we needed a little extra tick to throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Young's 14-yard touchdown pass to Rice with 8:37 left -- which he set up with 
scrambles of 14 and 19 yards -- gave the 49ers a 13-10 lead. Minnesota came 
back to go up, 17-13, on Alfred Anderson's one-yard run with 3:14 left before 
Young did a splendid impression of a Montana rally. 
</P>
<P>
The Vikings, who sacked Montana and Young six times, with Ken Clarke getting 
three of the sacks, used an aggressive defense and Herschel Walker's 
versatility to take their 10-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
After Fuad Reveiz's 34-yard field goal, Walker capped a 79-yard drive with a 
nine-yard touchdown run. Walker had four carries for 30 yards, caught an 
18-yard pass and threw a 12-yard halfback option pass to D.J. Dozier during the 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
Mike Cofer's field goals of 29 and 35 yards made it 10-6 early in the fourth 
quarter.

PATRIOTS CONCLUDE WORST SEASON WITH 13-10 LOSS;

<P>
The New England Patriots' worst season ended with one of their best drives of 
the year -- and a team-record 14th consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots looked as if they were on the verge of scoring the go-ahead 
touchdown or tying field goal Sunday against the New York Giants, but they came 
up empty as usual and the playoff-bound Giants escaped with a 13-10 victory. 
</P>
<P>
"It was the last game of the year, and I think we had something to prove," New 
England nose tackle Tim Goad said. "They're one of the league's best, and I 
think we handled them pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
Despite their strong performance, the Patriots finished 1-15, scoring only 181 
points -- the fewest in the NFL since the 16-game schedule was adopted in 1978. 
Buffalo's 200 points in 1985 was the previous low. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots broke the previous team mark for the worst record, set by the 1981 
club that was 2-14. For the first time in their 31-year history, the Patriots 
were winless at home. For the seventh consecutive game, they never held the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots' final drive began at the New England five-yard line with 9:31 
left and stalled at the Giants' 24 when John Stephens was stopped by Leonard 
Marshall for no gain on third and two. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots' hopes ended when the usually reliable Jason Staurovsky pulled a 
42-yard field-goal attempt wide to the left with 1:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
"The wind was blowing right to left," said Staurovsky, who kicked a 19-yard 
field goal with 6:02 left in the first half to tie the score, 10-10. "For some 
reason, I closed my hips. There is no reason to do that. I can make that kick 
20 out of 25 times." 
</P>
<P>
A 27-yard field goal by Matt Bahr with six seconds left in the first half 
proved to be the difference for the Giants (13-3), the champions of the NFC 
East who have a bye in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a struggle," Giant Coach Bill Parcells said. "New England played very 
well. We've got to be happy. We got out of here with (13) wins." 
</P>
<P>
Linebacker Lawrence Taylor said the Giants' difficulty in handling the Patriots 
was not indicative of the way they will perform in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
"We have no reason to believe that when the playoffs come, we can't be back on 
line," Taylor said. "It's what you do in the playoffs that count." 
</P>
<P>
Jeff Hostetler, replacing the injured Phil Simms at quarterback, completed 12 
of 23 passes for 123 yards and led all rushers with 82 yards in 10 carries. 
Hostetler is 4-0 as a starter since he joined the Giants in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
"I think we've got to pull things together," Hostetler said. "Everything is not 
together right now." 
</P>
<P>
The same might be said for Rod Rust's future as coach of the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
Rust is in the first year of a four-year contract, and Sam Jankovich, the 
Patriots' new chief executive officer, has said he will decide on Rust's future 
soon after the season. 
</P>
<P>
"I would have to wonder a little," Rust said. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots nearly avoided a halftime deficit for the first time in five 
games, but a fumbled snap by quarterback Tommy Hodson gave the Giants the ball 
at the New England 25 with 16 seconds left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Hostetler's 15-yard completion to Mark Ingram set up Bahr's 27-yard field goal 
that gave the Giants a 13-10 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants had built a 10-0 lead on their first two possessions on a 17-yard 
touchdown pass play from Hostetler to Dave Meggett and a 44-yard field goal by 
Bahr. 
</P>
<P>
On the possession after Bahr's field goal, Hodson capped an 81-yard drive by 
connecting with Irving Fryar on a 40-yard touchdown pass play. 
</P>
<P>
The Patriots tied the score on a 19-yard field goal by Staurovsky with six 
minutes left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
Hodson completed 12 of 23 passes for 118 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Stephens gained 81 yards in 19 carries for the Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
The Giants, who began the day in second place in the league in yards allowed 
(358.2 yards a game), held the Patriots to 258. 
</P>
<P>
That performance came one week after Phoenix rolled up 452 yards, the most 
against the Giants this season.

<P>
Golden West College, playing without its top player, won the Fullerton women's 
basketball tournament Sunday because of some horrible work at the free-throw 
line by College of the Sequoias. 
</P>
<P>
The Rustlers came away with a 71-68 victory, and Sequoias got a four-hour bus 
ride home to Visalia to ponder a game in which the Lady Giants made only six of 
29 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
Golden West (18-1) had its own handicap with Bits Sirchia, an all-state guard 
last season, sidelined with a twisted right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
But Tracy Wolfe, Allison Bickel and Jennifer Harney made the key plays in the 
final minute to secure the victory. Wolfe stole a pass with 46 seconds 
remaining and made a layup with 30 seconds left to give Golden West a 69-68 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias' Shaulonda Rittenhouse then missed a shot with 12 seconds to play. A 
scramble involving several players followed, then Golden West gained possession 
after a jump ball was called with 10 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
But the Rustlers turned the ball over when they failed to get it inbounds in 
the allowed five seconds. Sequoias (15-4) then inbounded the ball to Lataria 
Andrews, who was fouled while shooting with eight seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Andrews missed both free throws, and Harney got the rebound and was fouled with 
five seconds left. She missed her free throw, but Bickel got the rebound and 
made the layup for Golden West with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
Sequoias failed to get the ball to half-court before time ran out. Harney, the 
tournament's most valuable player, led Golden West with 24 points, 20 in the 
second half. Bickel added 13. 
</P>
<P>
In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
Fullerton 80, Los Angles Valley 57 -- Hollie Keeton scored 17 points, 13 in the 
second half for Fullerton (14-3). Nicki Durity added 16 and Vicki Evans and 
Keri Erkenbrack each had 13 for Fullerton, which led at the half, 41-33.

SOLIS SCORES SECOND STAKES VICTORY

<P>
Although Chris McCarron has been Southern California's hottest rider recently, 
Alex Solis is holding his own. 
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up the best year of his career, the 26-year-old Panamanian has won two 
of the first four stakes offered at Santa Anita. Four days after he brought 
Pleasant Tap from far back to win the Malibu, Solis directed Brought To Mind to 
an easy victory in the $110,000 La Brea Stakes Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
In winning her third consecutive since returning from a five-month layoff, 
Brought To Mind pushed Solis' earnings past $8 million. He ranks 10th 
nationally. 
</P>
<P>
"I've been working real hard hoping my business would get to where it is now," 
he said after Brought To Mind's 5 1/2-length victory over A Wild Ride and six 
others. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm very happy with the way things have gone. I've been watching all the good 
riders here and when you watch them, you can't help but learn. I'm still 
learning and I want to continue to learn. (Agent) Craig (O'Bryan) has done a 
great job. He has the experience and he's really been picking up the right 
horses." 
</P>
<P>
Brought To Mind, a 4-year-old Ruthie's Native filly, paid immediate dividends 
for new owner Tadahiro Hotehama. He bought her from Lindsey Semple for $250,000 
and she earned $65,000 for her success in the first leg of Santa Anita's La 
Canada Series. She will be back for the next step, the Jan. 12 El Encino Stakes 
at 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
Content to stalk Mahaska off the moderate pace (22 3/5 and 45 2/5 for the 
half-mile), the 3-1 third choice took command into the stretch and drew away in 
the final furlong. She covered the seven furlongs in 1:21 3/5. 
</P>
<P>
A Wild Ride, the 8-5 favorite while coupled with Chandelier, was two lengths 
ahead of 9-1 shot Mama Simba. Aishah, the 5-2 second choice who was a 
multiple-stakes winner in New York, was last in her California debut. 
</P>
<P>
"After she won (the Senorita Stakes) at Hollywood Park last May, she had a 
little splint and we had to stop on her and fire it," said trainer Ron McAnally 
after Brought To Mind's sixth victory in 13 tries. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't understand the big price today. She had the best post. (Wayne Lukas' 
entry) was down inside. Her last win at Hollywood was most impressive. Of 
course, she had everything her own way that day. I figured she would come from 
off the pace today. 
</P>
<P>
"We'll go through the La Canada Series with her. The 1 1/8 miles (of the La 
Canada Stakes) is questionable for her, but you never know. I didn't think 
Bayakoa would go that far originally." 
</P>
<P>
Solis said the gray filly is better now than she ever has been. "She's more 
relaxed and more into racing," he said. "You can rate her or do whatever you 
want with her. When you ask her to go, she really runs." 
</P>
<P>
Kanatiyr, who hasn't been worse than second in his last six starts, is one of 
12 entrants for today's $114,100 San Gabriel Handicap at 1 1/8 miles on the 
turf. 
</P>
<P>
A huge son of Chief Singer, Kanatiyr has a victory, a second and a third in 
three starts over the Santa Anita grass. He beat allowance rivals in his U.S. 
debut March 16, was third behind Golden Pheasant and Fly Till Dawn in another 
allowance race April 22, then was second to Notorious Pleasure in the Col. F.W. 
Koester Handicap Oct. 7. Chris McCarron will again ride for trainer Rick 
Mettee. 
</P>
<P>
Kanatiyr will race coupled with Colway Rally, who was the upset winner of the 
Citation Handicap at Hollywood Park in his last start. The 6-year-old Final 
Straw horse drew the outside post for trainer Julio Canani, who again will be 
ridden by Corey Black. 
</P>
<P>
Others in the lineup include Robinski, who won the Bay Meadows Handicap at 17-1 
earlier this month, The Medic, Aromatic, Rouvignac, In Excess, Chestnut Freeze, 
Edipo Rey, Silent Prince, Theatrical Charmer and Louis Cyphre. 
</P>
<P>
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
Gary Stevens, who has clinched his first money-winning title, won twice Sunday 
and surpassed his previous best total when France Soir finished second in 
Sunday's third race. By the end of the day, his total was $13,795,973, 
bettering his 1988 figure of $13,744,003. Stevens won two for trainer Wayne 
Lukas -- on Tomorrow's Song, who was impressive in her debut in the sixth race, 
and Farma Way in the seventh. . . . Speaking of France Soir, she's certainly 
one of the most consistent horses around. She now has finished second in five 
consecutive races after losing a photo to longshot Phil's Illusion. 
</P>
<P>
Valiant Pete, who was second to stablemate Frost Free in Saturday's Palos 
Verdes Handicap, grabbed a quarter in the race and will miss two to three weeks 
of training. . . . Chandelier was fourth in the La Brea, then came She's A 
V.P., Fly Gaelic, Mahaska and Aishah. Nasers Pride was scratched in favor of a 
race Tuesday.

JACKS DASH IS FUTURITY WINNER

<P>
Veteran trainer Rodney Hart called Jacks Dash the best 2-year-old he has ever 
handled after the bargain gelding won the $334,000 Golden State Futurity 
quarter-horse race Saturday night at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
It was the fifth consecutive victory for Jacks Dash since he was claimed for 
$12,500 at Los Alamitos on July 26. 
</P>
<P>
"This is the best 2-year-old I've ever had," said Hart, 57, who has trained at 
Los Alamitos since 1960. "He's really sound and doesn't have any problems." 
</P>
<P>
Jacks Dash broke alertly from post seven and led all the way in defeating 
Taking On The Cash, who was on the rail, by a head. Vital Sign finished third 
in the field of 10. STEVE SCHUELEIN

JOHN PISANO HITS RIGHT CHORDS FOR BRAZILIAN TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It was one of those cultural juxtapositions, like the kosher burrito, that we 
in Southern California have come to expect. This time it was Brazilian jazz 
being played in a Mexican restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
The occasion? New York-born guitarist John Pisano joining bassist Luther 
Hughes' trio Friday and Saturday nights for their regular weekend appearance at 
El Matador restaurant in the Huntington Harbour Mall. Pisano was a member of 
Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass and wrote material for Sergio Mendes and Brazil '66 
some years ago. He also accompanied Peggy Lee for a time and appeared on Joe 
Pass' momentous album "For Django." Pass included Pisano on his most recently 
recorded album as well. 
</P>
<P>
It was the Pass association that was most prevalent during Pisano's first set 
Friday. In a program of mostly familiar Brazilian standards, the guitarist, on 
both electric and acoustic instruments, played with clean, accurate tones and 
improvisational savvy of the kind that Pass has built his reputation on. In a 
world full of guitarists making a living on no more than three chords, Pisano 
deserves wider exposure. 
</P>
<P>
Opening on electric, Pisano pulled a classic Wes Montgomery-like sound from his 
instrument during Antonio Carlos Jobim's "Captain Baccardi," spiking melodic 
single-note lines with plucky, rhythmic chording. While keyboardist Matt Harris 
stated the winsome theme of "Cascade of the Seven Waterfalls," Pisano's 
soulful, samba-flavored chording moved along at the speed of a stroll in the 
sand. The tune ended with some spunky chordal exchange between guitar and 
keyboard that recalled the melody to Thelonious Monk's "Bright Moments." 
</P>
<P>
The guitarist switched to acoustic for his own "Amanhecer" -- Portuguese, 
Pisano explained, for "dawning" or "daybreak" -- spinning strings of 
well-defined notes into a narrative whole above Hughes' gently swaying bass. 
The bassist took a spare, considered solo on the tune, reworking the somber 
theme while backed by Harris' synthesized string accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
Everaldo Ferreira held down the percussive chores, working an understated 
double time on his cymbals during bossa nova-style beats and always keeping 
some suggestion of dance movement in his timekeeping. Odd man out on this night 
seemed Harris, whose electric keyboard solos, glistening with pop 
sensibilities, detracted from the evening's decidedly Brazilian feel. 
</P>
<P>
The crew found common ground on Jobim's well-worn "One-Note Samba" and "Summer 
Nights," the title cut from Pass' latest album. Though the rhythm section 
seemed a bit tentative on the reflective tune, Pisano put this mood to good 
use, coaxing an intoxicating blend of hope and nostalgia from his strings. The 
guitarist turned to his electric instrument on Neil Larson's "Sudden Samba," a 
lively romp which featured Ferreira using his snare as a kind of touchstone 
during his snappy drum solo. 
</P>

SAN DIEGO SPOTLIGHT: MEDIA: 1990'S QUOTES OF NOTE -- AND EVEN A FEW UNNOTABLES

People say a lot of things to reporters. Sometimes they even mean what they 
say. Sometimes it just comes out wrong. And sometimes it comes out right, they 
just didn't mean to say it. 
</P>
<P>
But it came out anyway. 
</P>
<P>
That's the joy of being a reporter. People say things to you, and you get to 
write them down. People who say they are misquoted often simply forgot -- or 
regretted -- what they said. 
</P>
<P>
More often than not, the words reveal more than their surface meaning. There is 
truth in them, although sometimes it's necessary to dig for it. 
</P>
<P>
Often this column is about quotes, examining the things people say. Here are 
some personal favorites from the past year: 
</P>
<P>
* "Anchoring is a lot harder than it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 -- KGTV (Channel 10) anchorman and commentator Herb Cawthorne 
</P>
<P>
* "It looks like the news from the old 'Mary Tyler Moore Show.' I expect to see 
Ted Baxter on the air and Murray pounding at the typewriter." 
</P>
<P>
 -- An unnamed source describing the KUSI-TV (Channel 51) newscast. 
</P>
<P>
* "I'm just glad I wasn't discriminated against because I'm white." 
</P>
<P>
 -- KGTV (Channel 10) anchorman Stephen Clark, responding to questions about 
racism on Channel 10's "Ask the Media." 
</P>
<P>
* "Hands up those who thought that was a mealy-mouthed answer." 
</P>
<P>
 -- ABC's Peter Jennings, responding to an answer by Channel 10 General Manager 
Ed Quinn during "Ask the Media." 
</P>
<P>
* "We think they are outstanding personalities, and they will fit well into a 
talk-show format." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 8 vice president Bill Moylan, explaining the choice of Pat Brown 
and Dave Hood to host an afternoon talk show, a few weeks before Hood was 
dropped from the show. A few weeks later, the whole concept was scrapped. 
</P>
<P>
* "Year after year, we get ripped a new one (over problem with the Emmy 
Awards), but every year it's there." 
</P>
<P>
 -- National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences board member Sue Strom, 
defending the Emmy Awards. 
</P>
<P>
* "It was a bunch of incredible stupidity on my part. Do I look embarrassed? I 
feel like a 9-year-old sent to the principal." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 8 sports guy Ted Leitner, apologizing on the air for using 
unauthorized video of a fight. 
</P>
<P>
* "Considering that Ross is an unemployed news reader who made a name for 
herself at another station, there can be only one explanation for Channel 10's 
enthusiasm to portray her as a top San Diego celebrity -- they've decided to 
hire her." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Brass, L.A. Times, seven months before Ross was hired by Channel 39. 
</P>
<P>
* "We decided our viewers didn't want to know where bad restaurants are." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 10 food critic Jack White, explaining why his reviews are almost 
always positive. 
</P>
<P>
* "Keep a low profile. Keep a check on your ego and smile a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 8 anchorwoman Susan Roesgen, giving advice to new Channel 10 
anchorman Stephen Clark. 
</P>
<P>
* "The news you want from people you like." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Channel 8's short-lived promotional slogan. 
</P>
<P>
* "San Diego is the biggest little fishbowl in the world. There is not a 
heckuva lot going on here for people to talk about." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former Channel 10 anchorman Michael Tuck, explaining why he has been the 
focus of so much gossip. 
</P>
<P>
* "I've always had heavy eyelids." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tuck, explaining why he had plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
Former KSDO-AM (1130) talk host John Krist has landed a job with WERC in 
Birmingham, Ala. He'll be the station's operations manager, as well as handling 
a talk show. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KSDO has signed Michael Reagan to a one-year contract extension. There are no 
new provisions in the contract, "just more money," general manager Mike Shields 
said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
The addition of Allison Ross to Channel 39's news team has fueled speculation 
about Denise Yamada's future. With Monica Gayle and Ross in the newsroom, the 
station has an abundance of top-drawer women anchors. But station General 
Manager Neil Derrough said Yamada is secure. "Allison is not going into the 
(anchor) rotation," he said. "She'll be part of the 4:30, and that's it." The 
station picked up a two-year option on Yamada's contract last summer. . . . 
</P>
<P>
Buoyed by Congress' inability to reregulate the cable industry, Daniels 
Cablevision, which serves coastal North County, is joining Cox Cable in raising 
the cost of its basic "Cable Plus" service by $2, to $20.95 from $18.95. The 
press release says it is still "the best entertainment bargain available at 
only 70 cents a day for 24 hours of entertainment, news and sports." Well, 
that's one way of looking at it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
KPBS-TV (Channel 15) will rebroadcast "Ballad of an Unsung Hero" and "Trail 
North," two excellent, locally produced programs depicting different 
experiences of Latinos in America, beginning at 8 p.m. Thursday. Another 
KPBS-produced program, "Uneasy Neighbors," will re-air as part of the new 
"American Pie" series, at 10 p.m. Wednesday.

SHERIDAN TAKES A HARD LOOK AT IRISH 'TROUBLES'; 
</P>
<P>
DIRECTOR: HIS NEW FILM RECALLS THE POTATO FAMINE AND LOOKS AT NORTHERN IRELAND, 
IRISH-AMERICANS AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH.

<P>
To put Jim Sheridan's "The Field" in motion, there's an early scene in which 
actor Richard Harris plucks a dandelion gone to fuzz: "This is what we'd be 
without the land, boy," he says to his surviving son, and blows the seeds to 
kingdom come. 
</P>
<P>
Set in the '30s, and recalling the potato famines that blew the Irish to 
America, "The Field," could have simply shed a tear for lost worlds -- like the 
current film "Avalon," for instance. But Sheridan, instead, means to smack 
Ireland for its fixation on "the troubles in North Ireland," and to have his 
say with the rest of us on the cost of obsession. 
</P>
<P>
"The Field," which co-stars John Hurt and Tom Beringer, has torn up the 
boxoffice in Ireland, doing "three times the business of 'My Left Foot,' " 
Sheridan's 1989 debut film (for which he received an Oscar nomination), and 
"more than 'Crocodile Dundee,' " he said during a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
Powered by Oscar winning performances by Daniel Day Lewis as the crippled 
Christy Brown and by supporting actress Brenda Fricker, "My Left Foot" was 
suprisingly far more a sensation in the United States than in the British 
Isles. 
</P>
<P>
What is surprising about Jim Sheridan is, that when he pops up from his seat to 
full height, he is one wee Irishman, around the five-foot mark. However, like 
his two small, but beguiling feature films, Sheridan projects big. 
</P>
<P>
At 41, this street-smart son of Dublin is different from the Irish poets, 
playwrights and politicians who have burned over the question of Northern 
Ireland: "The age old Irish-English conflict is played out," he said. Now 
Sheridan wants to know, if, outside Ireland, audiences will see not only beyond 
"The Field" 's metaphor for the north but respond to the film's mining of "the 
deep desire to be rid of a hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan sees the role played by Harris (originally intended for Ray McAnally 
before his death last year) as parallel to modern Ireland. Harris plays Bull 
McCabe, a man who has something of the Lear about him, and who is the last of 
the landed patriarchs. 
</P>
<P>
"He can't grieve for the death of his son," said Sheridan, "because he can't 
accept the fact. And that's the problem with Ireland: we won't allow the dead 
to be dead." 
</P>
<P>
"We don't always have to be in conflict to maintain our traditions," Sheridan 
said. "In the end, you say, 'Look, if you weren't so obsessive, if you looked 
inside you wouldn't be so upset about an external thing.' 
</P>
<P>
"People in Ireland want the conflict to end," he said, landing on the last word 
with all the force he can muster. "They just want it to be over." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan anticipated the wrath of Irish-Americans, who in the film are 
dismissed as weak for having fled the famines and resented for returning rich 
enough to buy the land out from under those why stayed. Berenger, who plays the 
American son of an Irish emigrant, returns out of "Roots" nostalgia at best, 
and parking-lot progress and economic pillage, at worst. 
</P>
<P>
Said Sheridan, "I thought we might have a trouble with them. But it hasn't been 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
Sheridan was also leery of the response by the Catholic Church, shown in the 
film as susceptible to the friendly persuasion of money. "The funny thing is 
that there's been no controversy. Not one word," he said, but recalled the day 
he froze when a nun rang him from the Catholic News Agency. 
</P>
<P>
"Oh now, I'm in trouble," he thought, "but she was devastated by the film and 
didn't see an anti-Church thing in it. That surprised me." 
</P>
<P>
"The Field" 's American run is a worry to its director. Currently in limited 
run, it's playing at only one Los Angeles-area theater, the Music Hall in 
Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
At $6.5 million to produce, it strains for the record books as Ireland's 
costliest indigenous feature. "If it's not commercially successful," he fears, 
"it'll be very difficult to make a film over $2 million to $3 million in 
Ireland." 
</P>
<P>
Can Ireland absorb more than the cost of a film's production, but the impact of 
its art? 
</P>
<P>
"The Irish attitude to any form that they work in, whether novels or plays and 
films, is to ask," Sheridan said, "how do we destroy this form? How do we end 
it so nobody else can write? How do we take this authority, this structure, and 
push it so far that there is no basis left for it? 
</P>
<P>
"You always have that feeling in Joyce or Beckett that they're trying to end 
the form they're working in. 
</P>
<P>
To Sheridan, film is stringing together bands of time, and dialogue "is utterly 
irrelevant. Not that it's unimportant, but it's like somebody on an escalator 
going the wrong way." 
</P>
<P>
The problem in making a film he said, "is to get rid of the literature without 
becoming a barbarian."

<P>
At dawn in deepest Soweto, Philemon Sibanyoni prepared for what is always the 
riskiest part of his day -- the drive to work. 
</P>
<P>
He peered out his living room windows, coated in clear plastic on the inside to 
repel hand grenades and covered on the outside by a decorative brick wall with 
slits through which to see. 
</P>
<P>
The street was quiet. It was time to move out. 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni put on his hat, went into the garage and backed his red Volkswagen 
down the narrow drive. A couple of neighbors usually spot the black man with 
thinning hair and glasses as he leaves, but they don't wave. He doesn't mind. 
Having good friends can be dangerous, Sibanyoni says. 
</P>
<P>
On bad days, Sibanyoni's route is blocked with stones or burning tires. On the 
good days, like this, the most unpleasant part of the journey is passing the 
revolutionary slogans splattered on the low walls: "Join the People's Army." 
"Down With Operation Iron Fist." "Viva ANC." 
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, Sibanyoni drove past the sandbags guarding Soweto's 
Dobsonville Police Station. He settled in behind his desk, and an aide brought 
coffee. Louis de Wet, a white captain, entered with a brisk salute for his 
commander. 
</P>
<P>
"Good morning, Maj. Sibanyoni," De Wet said. 
</P>
<P>
South Africa's 40,000 black police officers, accounting for roughly half the 
national force, have lived in constant fear as the number of attacks on them 
and their families jumped this year. 
</P>
<P>
More than 90 officers, most of them black, have been killed in 1990, the 
highest total since the township uprising of 1984-86. Some have died while on 
duty. Others were assassinated while sleeping in their beds, watching 
television, walking on the streets or driving their cars. 
</P>
<P>
Despised by anti-apartheid activists and shunned by almost everyone else, black 
police officers are the loneliest black men and women in the country. Yet 
blacks are still lining up by the thousands to join the police force, because 
in South Africa, a job -- any job -- is scarce. Police work, despite the risks, 
puts food on the table. 
</P>
<P>
Every six months, the nation's black police college graduates a new crop of 
1,260 recruits and sifts through twice that many applications for the next 
class. 
</P>
<P>
"We've got so many applications that we can't handle them all," said Col. 
Johann Fourie, deputy commander of the college, in Hammanskraal, north of 
Pretoria. 
</P>
<P>
The starting salary is good by township standards, about $4,500 a year, with 
rapid increases, and police officers receive medical benefits, home loans and 
tuition for technical colleges. 
</P>
<P>
"There is security for a young guy in the police force," said Lt. Benjamin 
Mavuso, a black instructor at the college. 
</P>
<P>
Financial security, maybe. But not much personal security. The gun they carry 
is little protection for the uniform they wear. 
</P>
<P>
Black police officers have long been a prime target of angry young radicals, 
who consider them deadly instruments of oppression and traitors to the black 
liberation cause. Over the past decade, hundreds of black protesters, guerrilla 
fighters and, occasionally, innocent bystanders have been killed by police 
bullets in the streets and, allegedly, by police boots and fists in 
interrogation rooms. 
</P>
<P>
This year, with the lifting of the four-year state of emergency and new 
political freedom for anti-apartheid groups, violence on both sides of the 
racial divide has soared. More than 230 black civilians have been killed by 
police trying to quell unrest, according to the Human Rights Commission in 
Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
"When I took the oath, my mother was a little bit worried," admitted Frank 
Mzondi, a 24-year-old constable who graduated from the police college in 
November. "But then I told her that being a policeman works hand in hand with 
religion. You must believe God will be at your side. When I told her that, she 
felt better." 
</P>
<P>
It is perhaps no coincidence that Philemon Sibanyoni is an elder in his church, 
a man who believes police work is a calling from God and for whom the Bible is 
an emotional shield. In church each Sunday, he searches for the peace that 
eludes him during the week. 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni joined the force when he was 19, and over the past 35 years he has 
been highly decorated, rising to a rank held by only a handful of black men. He 
commands a Soweto precinct with 140 policemen, is saluted by white as well as 
black officers and makes a comfortable annual salary of about $18,000, plus 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
But he has to vary his route to work each day and regularly changes the make of 
his unmarked police car. He is afraid to walk in his neighborhood, seldom 
emerges from his house at night and chain-smokes cigarettes, a habit he blames 
on "the pressure of the job." 
</P>
<P>
His wife, Rebecca, wants him to give up the blue uniform with the star on the 
shoulder and the 9-millimeter service revolver to become an ordinary citizen 
again. She is afraid for them both. 
</P>
<P>
Their house has been attacked twice by hand grenades, his car once stalled in 
the midst of a rock-throwing mob and just three months ago, while it was still 
daylight, Rebecca Sibanyoni was terrorized by 30 youths who raided their home 
in search of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
"You can't be proud to be a policeman now, because we are expecting a bomb at 
any time," Sibanyoni said one recent afternoon, resting on a sofa in the dark 
living room of his fortified house. The sounds of children playing in the 
street drifted in through an open window. 
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in the township identifies with us," he added. "We are totally 
isolated." 
</P>
<P>
The major, his wife and their 4-year-old grandson, Musa, live in a six-room 
house in the heart of Soweto, a township of 2.5 million blacks 15 miles 
southwest of Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
After a week of 10- to 12-hour workdays, Sibanyoni relaxes on Saturdays by 
gardening the narrow strip between the house and his fence. He often preaches 
at a Methodist church on Sundays, telling parishioners that he is not their 
boss but their servant. His favorite sermon revolves around the apostle Paul's 
admonition to the Romans: Obey those in authority. 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni was born 54 years ago on a white man's farm, and his father moved to 
Johannesburg to work as a laborer because he wanted a proper education for 
Philemon and his seven brothers and sisters. 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni joined the force in 1955, and his first assignments came in two white 
Johannesburg suburbs, where he handled crimes involving mostly black servants 
and gardeners. At the time, black policemen were not allowed to carry guns or 
arrest white people. 
</P>
<P>
The black police officer's primary duty until the late 1970s was to enforce the 
pass laws, which restricted the movement of blacks from rural areas to the 
white cities. It was unpleasant duty, and it made him a symbol of repression. 
</P>
<P>
"You would find someone being employed, trying to make an honest living, but 
simply because of the pass laws we had to arrest him," Sibanyoni remembered. "I 
wasn't happy with it. But there was nothing I could do. It was the law." 
</P>
<P>
In those days, many black men and women in South Africa kept their eyes 
lowered, grateful for any kindness from whites, and tried to ignore the 
inequality of the segregated, white-run society. 
</P>
<P>
"We took everything as it came. What could we do? We had to accept it, good or 
bad," Sibanyoni said. "But I've always felt I was equal (to a white). Though he 
may not accept it, I know it." 
</P>
<P>
In 1977, Sibanyoni was transferred to the Jabulani police station in Soweto, 
the country's largest black township. That year, Steve Biko, leader of the 
Black Consciousness movement, died of a cerebral hemorrhage while in police 
custody. A year earlier, police attempts to stop an uprising of students in 
Soweto had touched off a nationwide blood bath. 
</P>
<P>
By 1984, the townships were seething. As police used guns and tear gas to put 
down the disturbances, they moved into the cross hairs of angry anti-apartheid 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
As Sibanyoni put it: "That's when our death warrants were signed." 
</P>
<P>
A hand grenade aimed at Sibanyoni's bedroom window that year bounced off the 
frame and exploded outside, shattering all the house's windows. No one was 
hurt, but Sibanyoni decided to send his three children to boarding schools far 
away. 
</P>
<P>
The township trouble escalated, but, Sibanyoni said, he never seriously 
considered resigning, as anti-apartheid activists demanded. 
</P>
<P>
"Being black, I have no vote," Sibanyoni said. "I don't make the laws of this 
country, and they know that very well. Will they give me a job if I leave the 
force? Will they maintain my children? I've got to fend for my own living." 
</P>
<P>
He knew that police had killed many people, but he said it was the only way to 
protect innocent lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
"If there are no other ways of stopping people from rioting, burning businesses 
and killing, we have to apply heavier measures," he said. "And that's what the 
members (of the force) did." 
</P>
<P>
As attacks on black policemen increased, many of them moved to the outskirts of 
Soweto, settling in residential enclaves where they could protect each other. 
Sibanyoni wanted to move too, and he put his $17,000 house up for sale. But 
there were no buyers, and two years later he borrowed $8,000 and hired a 
construction company to fortify it. 
</P>
<P>
A brick curtain wall, with narrow gaps, was erected outside his living room and 
bedroom windows. He also extended the garage, covering the dining room windows. 
Even if it didn't stop people from wanting to kill him, he figured, it would 
keep them from succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
During the construction, in 1986, a second hand grenade was tossed at the 
house, again ricocheting off the facade into the yard, where it exploded, 
causing no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
He soon felt safer at home, but the township still was dangerous. At midnight 
on New Year's Eve that year, Sibanyoni turned down a street barricaded with 
rocks and burning tires. As he tried to reverse, his car stalled, and large 
stones hailed down from the darkness. 
</P>
<P>
He pulled his pistol from its holster, preparing to use it for the first time, 
and thought, "I've got to defend myself or die," he remembered. But before he 
could fire, a voice shouted at the youths, telling them to stop. The stoning 
ended and Sibanyoni drove away. 
</P>
<P>
The extra protection at home discouraged attacks until last September. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Sibanyoni, who runs a nursery school, was home alone when the phone 
line was cut and more than two dozen young men, armed with automatic rifles, 
pistols and knives, scaled a wall and burst in through the back door. 
</P>
<P>
They demanded firearms, including the major's ceremonial sword, part of his 
dress uniform. Then they searched the house and, finding no sword or other 
weapons, left with three police caps, two camouflage shirts, one jacket, a pair 
of trousers, a portable piano and a radio. 
</P>
<P>
Rebecca Sibanyoni wasn't hurt, but she was shaken. 
</P>
<P>
"We're no longer safe here," she told her husband. "I know it's an important 
job. But it's also dangerous, too dangerous for a family man." 
</P>
<P>
The Sibanyonis' neighborhood once was full of police officers and their 
families. But now Sibanyoni is the only one left. He doesn't go out of his way 
to make friends outside the police force and his church. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't want somebody close to me," he said. "It's always a risk. You let your 
guard down and you can be ambushed." 
</P>
<P>
That attitude pervades the police force. 
</P>
<P>
In Sibanyoni's station in Dobsonville, a sign on the bulletin board reads: "You 
are the target." As if anyone needed to be told. A few weeks ago, one of the 
station's detectives was attacked while walking near his home and ended up in 
the hospital, fortunate to be alive. 
</P>
<P>
"It's only the lucky policeman who hasn't been attacked," Sibanyoni said. 
</P>
<P>
Like many police officers, Sibanyoni blames the newly legalized African 
National Congress for the attacks. 
</P>
<P>
"The ANC wants to make the country ungovernable, and each and every government 
institution is under attack -- schools, hospitals, township councils," 
Sibanyoni said. "The only stumbling block is the police." 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni doesn't blame ANC leader Nelson Mandela, whom he remembers as a good 
lawyer who often defended black policemen in the 1950s. But he blames the 
radical ANC youth, who don't listen to Mandela's pleas for peace. 
</P>
<P>
"Everything went wrong from the start," he said. "These children were never 
taught about civics. They don't know that a policeman is not serving the 
government. He is serving and protecting them. The policeman will be here long 
after this government is gone." 
</P>
<P>
But police still kill protesters, and activists say police continue to torture 
detainees as well. This year, two 15-year-old activists have died of blows to 
the skull while being questioned by police. A police investigation has absolved 
the interrogators. 
</P>
<P>
The ANC also contends that right-wing police officers have been behind the 
current wave of black faction fighting that has seized townships around 
Johannesburg, leaving more than 1,000 dead in the past five months. ANC leaders 
say the police support Zulu chief Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi's Inkatha Party, 
which has been at war with ANC supporters. 
</P>
<P>
The police deny the allegations. No independent investigations have been 
conducted into the violence. 
</P>
<P>
Sibanyoni's precinct of Dobsonville -- with 100,000 residents, it is about the 
size of Santa Monica -- is one of the quieter areas of Soweto. Yet it has a 
weekly average of one murder, 15 armed robberies and 15 car thefts. 
</P>
<P>
Of Sibanyoni's force, only Capt. De Wet is not black, but many white police 
work in the Soweto riot squad, under the command of a white officer. (The pay 
scales for black and white police are identical, but many more whites than 
blacks hold officer rank.) 
</P>
<P>
Because they live and work in the townships, black police generally face far 
greater risks than their white colleagues. But Sibanyoni is philosophical about 
the dangers. 
</P>
<P>
"I cannot escape death," he said. "It will come anyhow, so running away from 
death is impossible." 
</P>
<P>
However, he recently began scouting apartments in Johannesburg, where the City 
Council has voted to open neighborhoods to blacks. He's weary of the constant 
threat of attack but also disturbed by the loud radios in his Soweto 
neighborhood. Yet complaining about the noise is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
"If I say something, I am inviting trouble," he explained. "My policy is to 
remain anonymous." 
</P>
<P>
So instead he dreams of greener pastures in Johannesburg. 
</P>
<P>
"It's quiet there," he said. "Even if your dog barks too much, the police come. 
And there is no possibility that I wake up in the morning and find stones 
blocking the road." 
</P>
<P>
In July, Sibanyoni will be eligible to leave the force and begin drawing his 
pension. He's had his mind made up on that for some time now. 
</P>
<P>
"I will retire then," he said. "If I'm still alive, of course."

LONG-TERM STATE CITRUS DAMAGE SEEN; 
</P>
<P>
AGRICULTURE: YOUNG TREES ARE DYING FROM FREEZING WEATHER. SOME FARMERS GIVE UP 
ON THIS YEAR'S FRUIT PRODUCTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
The cold snap that already has devastated this year's citrus crop could also 
dramatically curtail the number of lemons, oranges and avocados produced next 
year, farmers and agricultural officials said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Some farmers expect their citrus production to be half of normal next year 
because the cold weather is killing young orange and lemon trees and ravaging 
new growth on older trees. 
</P>
<P>
Avocado production in Tulare County is likely to be wiped out for 1991, said 
county agricultural commissioner Lenord Craft. Tulare farms about 11,000 acres 
of avocados, which are a $3-million crop annually. 
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at not even having an avocado crop in Tulare next year," Craft 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers interviewed Sunday said they were no longer trying to save this year's 
fruit. What was still on the trees -- for navel oranges, about 80% of the crop 
-- is nearly all lost, farmers said. 
</P>
<P>
"I didn't pick an orange," said Keith Nilmeier, a Fresno citrus grower. "We 
gave up on our field." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they were concentrating on saving their trees. If the trees die in 
great numbers, it could have a long-range impact on the state's fruit 
production and its economy. California produces about half the nation's fruit 
and vegetables, supporting a $17.5-billion industry. 
</P>
<P>
The economic toll of the recent freeze is expected to top $1 billion. Oranges 
and lemons worth hundreds of millions of dollars have been destroyed. Acre upon 
acre of broccoli, artichokes and celery are lost. About 15,000 Northern 
California farm workers are expected to lose their jobs, and innumerable others 
are losing business in a wide array of related industries such as trucking and 
shipping. 
</P>
<P>
The impact in future years should be considerably less. But if fruit production 
is substantially curtailed in 1991, it will mean fewer jobs for pickers, 
packers, truckers, crate manufacturers and many others. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest long-range concern is the health of citrus and avocado trees, 
farmers said. It takes up to five years to bring new trees into full fruit 
production, therefore lost trees set farmers back significantly. 
</P>
<P>
At this point, farmers have no way of knowing how many trees will die. Most 
believe that they will not be able to tally their losses until spring. Many 
already have seen bark splitting and cracking, which means that the new growth 
-- which supports next year's crop -- is in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
"We have some severe bark-splitting in both the lemons and the oranges," said 
Lee Bailey, of Bailey Brothers, a large citrus grower in Orange Cove. "We'd be 
lucky to have half to a third of our crop next year." 
</P>
<P>
Farmers continue to battle the cold. Although temperatures were rising this 
weekend, many areas were plagued with below-freezing weather. 
</P>
<P>
Lows reported early Sunday by the National Weather Service include 16 degrees 
in Lancaster, 18 in Redding, 25 in Fresno, 24 in Stockton and Sacramento, 26 in 
Bakersfield and 30 in Imperial. Temperatures are expected to rise during this 
week into the 40s and 50s through much of Northern California, where the freeze 
hit hardest. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Southern California is enjoying much milder weather, which is 
expected to continue for at least several days, said National Weather Service 
specialist Betty Reo. The high temperature today is expected to reach the mid 
to high 60s at the Los Angeles Civic Center. New Year's Day should dawn chilly 
but warm later to the low 70s. 
</P>
<P>
A second storm that was expected to hit this weekend was not as severe as 
anticipated. "The storm went due east and we just got the tail end of the 
effects," Reo said. A northeasterly wind helped keep temperatures up, she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura County farmers were spared further damage to hard-hit crops during the 
first week of winter. 
</P>
<P>
"We seem to have dodged a major bullet," said a relieved Rex Laird, executive 
director of the Ventura County Farm Bureau. "We were expecting a front that was 
going to be even colder than the one that hit us last week. But it seems to 
have veered over toward Arizona." 
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, the county's farmers -- some of whom stayed up all night 
Saturday prepared to turn on smudge pots and wind machines -- reported no 
significant damage from the latest edition of the so-called Yukon Express. 
</P>
<P>
For the next week, the farmers' improved luck should hold, said National 
Weather Service meteorologist Terry Schaeffer. He predicted gradually 
moderating temperatures, with westerly winds bringing increased humidity by the 
end of the week. Such conditions generally favor farmers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Although Northern California temperatures are still worrisome to farmers, they 
are substantially better than what had been expected only days ago, when 
weather forecasts called for another weekend of freezing cold. 
</P>
<P>
Farmers said they were using wind machines and water to raise field 
temperatures the few degrees needed to save the older trees. Young trees around 
the perimeter of many farms are already lost, farmers said. Some estimated that 
as many as 20% of the 3- to 4-year-old trees also would fall victim to the 
cold. 
</P>
<P>
"There is quite a bit of die-back," said Craft. "The trees that are under 4 
years old that were unprotected are going to die. But some trees that were 
protected will do fine. We don't have any way of estimating at this point what 
percentage of the trees are hurt." 
</P>
<P>
Vegetable crops also have been severely damaged by the freeze. Farmers said 
there would only be a short-term impact from the loss of broccoli, celery and 
artichoke crops because these vegetables are planted and harvested in 
three-month cycles. 
</P>
<P>
Trees are another story. 
</P>
<P>
"We are just trying to maintain the integrity of our bud woods," said Nilmeier. 
"The mature trees won't die, but we could be looking at a half-crop or less for 
next year." 
</P>
<P>
Times staff writer Judy Pasternak and correspondent Jack Searles contributed to 
this story.

There's good news for Californians who are concerned about increased air

RIOT FEAR CANCELS CONCERT BY 'BAD RELIGION' BAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One day after a crowd of violent concert-goers trashed a North Hollywood 
theater and damaged neighboring storefronts, promoters of the popular punk rock 
band Bad Religion canceled a Sunday performance in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
Organizers of the canceled concert at the Whisky said they feared a repeat of 
the Saturday night melee that erupted at the Classic Theater on Lankershim 
Boulevard when the band's concert was halted because the auditorium was 
overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
More than 300 angry fans pulled out chairs bolted to the floor and smashed 
windows outside after they were ordered to leave by fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
Two police officers and several people in the crowd suffered minor injuries. 
Four people were arrested on suspicion of vandalism. The Classic Theater 
owners, who could not be reached Sunday, were cited for overcrowding and 
improper use of the facility, which fire officials said is not licensed for 
live entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
Police estimated damage to the theater and surrounding businesses, where 
windows were smashed, at $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
Rick Van Santen, a spokesman for Goldenvoice Productions, which organized 
Saturday's show, said Sunday's concert was postponed just hours before it was 
to begin because of fears the rioters would return. He said tickets for both 
weekend shows will be honored at a performance Feb. 1 at the Hollywood 
Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
"We felt it was too risky," he said. "This way, it's safer for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
The riot Saturday broke out shortly after 8:30 p.m. Firefighters passing the 
theater at 5269 Lankershim Blvd. noticed crowds outside. Because the 
auditorium, which dates back at least to the 1930s, was recently reopened after 
nearly a year of darkness, the firefighters reported the activity to their 
supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
When a fire inspector arrived at the theater, he saw fans standing on chairs 
and crowding the aisles, Assistant Bureau Cmdr. Tony Ennis said. The theater is 
permitted to seat 1,261, Ennis said. Fire officials said they counted about 
1,860 concert-goers. Van Santen said the theater has a capacity of about 1,400 
and that 1,321 tickets were sold. 
</P>
<P>
He disputed the count by fire officials, but said concert organizers had to 
abide by the order to shut down the show. 
</P>
<P>
After an opening act and before Bad Religion took the stage, a concert manager 
announced that the performance was over. The angry crowd began to file out of 
the auditorium chanting "start the revolution" and cursing police and fire 
officials, according to one concert-goer. 
</P>
<P>
As the unruly crowd filed out, one person fell against a glass door, sending 
out a loud cracking noise, said Terry Bing, who operated the concession stand 
at the theater. 
</P>
<P>
Then "all hell broke loose," said a concert-goer who only gave his name as 
Chris. 
</P>
<P>
People smashed windows, display cases and glass doors. More than 200 chairs 
were pulled out or damaged. Trash cans were lobbed across the lobby. A small 
fire was started in an upstairs restroom. A crowd that had gathered across the 
street began to move toward the theater and firefighters used water hoses to 
keep them at bay, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
It took nearly two hours to restore order to the street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The melee was at odds with the message that Bad Religion says it is attempting 
to spread. "What we try to do in our songs is make people responsible for their 
own actions," lead singer Greg Gaffin said during the disturbance.

SAN DIEGO AT LARGE: STRAIGHT TALK LEAVES HIM OUT OF WORK AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TONY PERRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Howard Robbins has talked his way into unemployment again. 
</P>
<P>
Some months ago, I told you how Robbins, 24, was fired as a security guard in 
Sorrento Valley after urging an engineering firm to recycle its trash. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, he signed up with Volt Temporary Services, which found him a 
$6.30-an-hour job with a contractor who is remodeling the Marriott Residency 
Inn in La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
Things were jolly until Robbins discovered that his pay was only 52% of the 
hourly amount the contractor was paying Volt. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins remembered seeing a video at Volt saying that employees got 72.9% of 
the amount that employers pay Volt. He talked with the Volt manager in 
Clairemont about the discrepancy. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins says the manager informed him that the contractor had just notified her 
that Robbins' services were no longer required. Robbins felt he was being 
snookered. 
</P>
<P>
Leon Boone, the contractor, said he was sorry to lose a hard worker like 
Robbins: 
</P>
<P>
"Volt called and said Howard had been reassigned and wouldn't be coming back. 
They told me that they had concerns about him because he had raised some 
questions about how much he was being paid." 
</P>
<P>
The Volt manager in Clairemont won't discuss Robbins. Neither will the Volt 
regional supervisor in Orange County, who suggested that I was a spy for a 
rival job agency. 
</P>
<P>
After several days, the supervisor told Robbins that he could return to work if 
Boone approved. But Boone already had received a replacement worker from Volt 
and had no openings. 
</P>
<P>
Robbins, a business major at Mesa College, is out of luck and out of work. 
</P>
<P>
He knows he may suffer further lumps unless he learns to bend a bit in pursuit 
of a paycheck. He has a solution: 
</P>
<P>
"I think I should work for myself." 
</P>
<P>
Sounds like a good idea.

ARSON SUSPECTED IN FIRE THAT KILLED 3 U.S. SERVICEMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

Arson is suspected in a fire that roared through a hotel early Sunday near a 
U.S. Navy base in the Philippines and killed three Americans, including one 
believed to be assigned to the San Diego-based aircraft carrier Ranger, U.S. 
and Filipino officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Officials intensified efforts in the Philippines to identify all three, but 
said two were burned beyond recognition in the fire, which raced through the 
34-room Royal Lodge Hotel in Olangapo, close to the Subic Bay base. 
</P>
<P>
A Filipino woman also was killed and two other Americans were hurt in the fire, 
which began about 1:30 a.m. local time Sunday at the two-story hotel, one of 
many lodges around the base packed with sailors on the way to the Persian Gulf, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
The two injured Americans were in stable condition at the Navy's Subic Bay 
hospital, said Bob Coble, a base spokesman. They also were believed to be 
assigned to ships accompanying the Ranger, part of a massive convoy that 
arrived at Subic Bay from San Diego on Thursday on its way to the gulf. 
</P>
<P>
The Navy withheld the names of all five sailors. Filipino officials declined to 
release the name of the woman. 
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire was not determined, but officials said signs pointed to 
arson. 
</P>
<P>
"We cannot discount the possibility of an arson, that's what I think," Ador 
Alfonso, an investigator with the U.S. Naval Investigative Service, said in a 
telephone interview. He declined to provide additional details. 
</P>
<P>
Once ignited, the fire fanned rapidly through the hotel, Olangapo firefighters 
and police officers said. Witnesses told the Associated Press that dozens of 
Americans fled the hotel in their nightclothes. 
</P>
<P>
"It was a very quick fire," Alfonso said. 
</P>
<P>
The hotel is about a mile from the main gate at Subic, which is about 50 miles 
west of Manila, Cpl. Jose Gonzalez, an Olangapo police officer, said by phone. 
"It's all ashes now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was an old hotel," Alfonso said. "It was not really a first-class hotel or 
second-class hotel, just an ordinary hotel." 
</P>
<P>
The Ranger and at least 13 other ships left San Diego and Long Beach earlier 
this month, headed for the Persian Gulf -- the largest amphibious task force to 
ship out from Southern California since 1965.

Doctors report that a new drug designed to help make blood clot in people with 
hemophilia is safe and effective. The drug is supposed to be an exact copy of 
the natural clotting substance known as factor VIII. 
</P>
<P>
It was developed through genetic engineering techniques by Cutter Biological in 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
In tests on 107 people with hemophilia, the researchers concluded that the 
genetically engineered version of factor VIII "is safe and clinically effective 
for the prevention and treatment" of bleeding caused by hemophilia. 
</P>
<P>
Human tests of the genetically engineered factor VIII began in June, 1988, 
according to the researchers involved in the new study. 
</P>
<P>
The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, mean that 
hemophiliacs may someday be able to use the new drug to stop their bleeding 
without the risk of developing AIDS or other potentially deadly diseases 
associated with conventional treatment. 
</P>
<P>
The group, led by Dr. Richard S. Schwartz of Cutter, found that the engineered 
form of factor VIII stayed in the body just as long, if not longer, than the 
factor VIII extracted from donated blood.

TOOTHPASTE LINKED TO ASTHMA

Asthma sufferers who find themselves wheezing and coughing might look to their 
toothpaste as a possible cause of their problems, two doctors said last week. 
An artificial mint flavoring found in a brand of toothpaste made from an opaque 
paste instead of a gel apparently triggered breathing problems in a 21-year-old 
woman with a history of asthma, according to a letter published in the New 
England Journal of Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
Then, she switched toothpastes. She had been using Crest Tartar Control 
toothpaste, "but when she switched to a gel-based toothpaste her wheezing 
resolved dramatically," wrote Drs. Bruce Spurlock and Thomas Dailey of Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
When the woman subsequently used any paste-based toothpaste, she started 
wheezing again within 10 minutes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
Terry Glover, spokeswoman for Procter and Gamble Co., the maker of Crest, said 
she was unaware of any other cases in which toothpaste apparently induced 
asthma symptoms.

ENVIRONMENT: THERE WILL BE NO EARTH DAY IN 1991, SAYS CHRIS DESSER. 'OUR TIME 
IS BETTER SPENT WORKING ON THE ISSUES.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Chris Desser is still explaining to people that there isn't going to be another 
Earth Day extravaganza, at least not in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
"It was never our intent to establish an annual holiday," she says. "The idea 
was to launch a decade of environmental activism." 
</P>
<P>
Desser, 36, is winding down her job as executive director of Earth Day 90, the 
April 22 global binge of tree-plantings, recycling rallies, rain-forest 
pageants, nature walks, TV specials, trash-ins, teach-ins and assorted other 
earth-friendly activities. 
</P>
<P>
But there is no official encore in 1991, she says. 
</P>
<P>
"The intent from the start was to focus public attention on the problems we are 
facing as a planet," says Desser. "It was to be a massive education effort that 
would culminate on April 22 and galvanize a whole generation of environmental 
activists." 
</P>
<P>
The 1990 event, which marked the 20th anniversary of the first Earth Day, was 
organized out of national headquarters in Palo Alto with 15 regional offices, a 
staff of 80 and thousands of volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Earth Day 90 left a string of impressive statistics: An estimated 200 million 
participants in 140 countries. In the United States, campus coordinators in 130 
areas overseeing activities at more than 2,000 colleges. Environmental lesson 
plans distributed to 120,000 K-12 schools. More than 100 cities enrolled in a 
project to develop local environmental planning ordinances. 
</P>
<P>
And such a tidal wave of media attention that purists hinted that media hype 
was overshadowing the real needs of a deteriorating planet. Still, Desser 
thinks the massive effort made its point: "I am pleased with the Earth Day job. 
Not that we took care of all the issues by any means, but I think it made a big 
dent in peoples' consciousnesses." 
</P>
<P>
The timing was right, she says. "We didn't do it alone -- we stood on the 
shoulders of a whole bunch of environmental groups who have been there for a 
long, long time, but we went beyond that. For many people Earth Day 90 now is 
the single event they will be able to point to when they talking about waking 
up to the environmental crisis. And the things people tell me about how it 
affected kids are spine-chilling: Suddenly environmental consciousness is a 
part of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
In summary, she says, "We really wanted to change the way people think. I think 
we got a lot of things started." 
</P>
<P>
Her board of directors, mostly people involved in heavy-hitting environmental 
projects, have gone back to their work. 
</P>
<P>
Desser has moved the office to San Francisco and, with one assistant, Blaine 
Townsend, is dealing with the other inheritance of Earth Day -- a substantial 
debt. Earth Day sponsors raised about $2.2 million toward the $3-million cost. 
The debt is being retired mainly through art sales, she says: "Artists Robert 
Rauschenberg and Ed Ruscha had created Earth Day lithographs which were 
produced in a limited edition." For the last eight months she has been selling 
the lithographs, often to Earth Day creditors "who have been able to develop an 
interest in art." 
</P>
<P>
The winding-down process is frustrating in many ways, she says, because the 
office still gets thousands of letters and doesn't have the resources to 
respond. Teachers across the country want copies of the Earth Day environmental 
lesson plan; many correspondents just want generic environmental information. 
</P>
<P>
And she gets lots of calls asking "Why don't you organize another Earth Day?" 
</P>
<P>
Desser, a San Francisco lawyer who had been focusing on land-use issues on the 
city attorney's staff, won't return to that job, but will concentrate on 
full-time environmental work. 
</P>
<P>
"I couldn't go back to doing anything else," she says. "These issues have 
become too important to me." 
</P>
<P>
She is considering several options, but organizing a 1991 Earth Day is not 
among them. 
</P>
<P>
"If it's an annual holiday, the issues become trivialized and the advertising 
benefits become emphasized," she says. 
</P>
<P>
"Most holidays are looking back, but we had one that was looking ahead. Now our 
time is better spent working on the issues themselves."

RUNAWAYS: AFTER YEAR OF TUMULT, STABILITY IS RETURNING TO COVENANT HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN HENDRIX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The mood at Covenant House on Sunset Boulevard seems light and fluid: 
</P>
<P>
Staff wander around, joking with clients. There's a tender farewell and lots of 
"good lucks" for a 20-year-old man, addicted to heroin since age 9, who is 
leaving after four weeks for a residential treatment program. Several young 
people are in quiet counseling sessions. And inside the newly opened clinic, 
nurse Eileen Kelly examines a young woman from Sacramento who had arrived at 
the shelter the night before. 
</P>
<P>
Gone are the pictures of Father Bruce Ritter, posed with prominent people; 
likewise, the framed press clippings and proclamations. In their place, 
colorful posters bear messages such as "It's OK to Be You." 
</P>
<P>
The past 12 months have been tumultuous for Covenant House, the nation's 
largest shelter program for street children, which opened its Los Angeles 
branch with a 20-bed shelter and outreach program in 1989. Covenant House had 
become synonymous with Ritter, the Franciscan priest who founded it 20 years 
ago in New York City and expanded it to 14 other cities. He was its charismatic 
leader and extraordinary fund-raiser, and became a much-recognized and honored 
public figure. 
</P>
<P>
Late last year, allegations of sexual misconduct with young men surfaced 
against Ritter, followed by questions of financial impropriety and 
mismanagement. The Franciscans ordered Ritter, who has not been charged with 
any crime, to resign from Covenant House last February and return to the order; 
he has been in seclusion since then. An investigation, commissioned by the 
Covenant House board and released in August, concluded that Ritter had engaged 
in sexual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
The scandalous atmosphere surrounding Ritter's downfall and removal from 
Covenant House threatened to bring down the program as well. 
</P>
<P>
But Robert McGrath, senior vice president for communications, says the national 
fund-raising picture has changed from bleak to encouraging. (Projections 
necessitated a $12.5-million cut from an $87-million national budget; Los 
Angeles contributions fell about 20% in 1990.) 
</P>
<P>
Sister Mary Rose McGeady became president and chief executive director in 
September and morale is said to be high. The recent naming of Fred Ali, who 
served three years as Covenant's director in Alaska, as executive director of 
the Los Angeles program is viewed as a message of stability. 
</P>
<P>
That stability has not come easily. Program changes have been implemented and 
strict policies instituted regarding relations between staff and clients. 
Ritter's trademark policy -- "We never turn a kid away" -- has been retained, 
but staff members describe a more serious and comprehensive approach to working 
with clients. 
</P>
<P>
"What we've seen during this shakeout period over the past 12 months is we're 
getting to know who our clients are and what services are available to connect 
them with," Ali said recently by telephone from Alaska. "We're much more stable 
in the residential area. We have good tight case management. We have a tighter 
staff/kids ratio." 
</P>
<P>
Brother Robert McCarthy, director of residential services, says Covenant House 
has plans for a permanent facility with a 60-bed shelter, and is interested in 
developing special programs for residential drug treatment and another for 
mothers and babies. 
</P>
<P>
But as Covenant House develops better systems and networks, reduced funding 
threatens its expansion plans. Help available to street children, both locally 
and nationwide, has dwindled. Needs have grown. 
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Covenant's blue vans continue its outreach program here, cruising 
Hollywood streets from 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. and passing out bologna sandwiches, hot 
chocolate, Covenant House business cards and offers of help. On any given 
night, about 60% of the shelter's residents are not from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
These are not runaways "who had a fight about using the family car," says 
McCarthy. 
</P>
<P>
Ali says the problems and numbers are worsening: "We see an increasing number 
of kids with real mental health (problems). They need a long-term therapeutic 
environment. Substance abuse runs the gamut. With crack addiction, it's worse 
every time I come to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"There are not enough resources to help the 18-to-20-year-olds. Homelessness is 
just staggering, and violence seems to be increasing on the streets. The needs 
of these kids are just phenomenal."

MEDIA: SOME SAY THE PRACTICE OF 'OUTING' MAY HAVE BENEFITED GAY RIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH ANN KRIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Outing, the phenomenon of exposing allegedly gay, lesbian or bisexual 
personalities -- usually through the media -- continued to flourish throughout 
1990, chiefly in the gay press and supermarket tabloids. 
</P>
<P>
Increasing numbers of reportedly gay actors, politicians, entertainment moguls, 
professional athletes and rock musicians were named in these publications, and 
occasionally in mainstream media articles as well. 
</P>
<P>
The debate over whether the practice is a form of psychological terrorism or a 
powerful, political tool also raged on. But by year's end, some outing 
proponents and opponents alike said the controversy may have benefited the gay 
rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
"Outing brought a whole new level of cutting-edge honesty. Anyone who is 
helping (allegedly homosexual) celebrities hide is now seen as old-fashioned," 
says Michaelangelo Signorile, a gay gossip columnist for New York-based Outweek 
magazine. Earlier this year, Signorile's reporting on the alleged bisexual 
pursuits of the late Malcolm Forbes brought outing to the attention of many 
mainstream media organizations. 
</P>
<P>
"Obviously, we've seen the tabloids take to (outing) in a big way," adds 
Signorile, whose publication continues to label or imply that various 
personalities are gay or lesbian. "The mainstream media, I think, came down 
against it for a lot of moral reasons, but in practice, I've seen them change. 
For instance, I've seen a lot of the (mainstream) gossip columnists not writing 
about (gay) people as if they're heterosexual any more. They're not sheltering 
them. And I've seen more stars asked if they're gay in interviews in mainstream 
publications." 
</P>
<P>
Robert Bray, an outing opponent who serves as the public information director 
for the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, still believes in his 
organization's position that gays and lesbians should not be forced from the 
closet. But he says the outing debate had some positive side effects. 
</P>
<P>
"The debate this caused in the mainstream media was unprecedented," he says. 
"If there's a silver lining to the whole controversy, it's that the media 
reported about the closet to a mass audience, that many gays live in shame in 
the closet and how pervasive and contemptuous the stigma is. 
</P>
<P>
"The real debate that outing caused was in newsrooms around the country as 
reporters weighed the need for unbiased, accurate reporting with the sensitive 
subject of a person's private life." 
</P>
<P>
One gay-oriented publication, not particularly known for outing under its 
previous editor, expects to become far more aggressive in reporting on 
homosexuals in the closet. "We're in favor of outing," reports Richard 
Rouilard, who earlier this year became the editor in chief of the Advocate, a 
biweekly gay and lesbian magazine based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
"We're working on outing stories on right-wing politicians and Vatican 
officials. But they're investigative pieces. We don't do lists (of alleged gays 
and lesbians). These stories are going to be properly sourced."

ECONOMY: SIX MONTHS LATER, TERRY BALLARD IS STILL LOOKING FOR WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Back in August, a good three months before Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan 
Greenspan finally made it official, Terry Ballard of Cypress pretty much knew 
the economy was heading downhill. 
</P>
<P>
In June, she had been laid off from a $45,000-a-year job as a facilities 
engineer for Douglas Aircraft Co., one of the estimated 8,000 Douglas workers 
who had been or were going to be laid off this year. 
</P>
<P>
When she was interviewed in August, Ballard, who turns 53 today, was feeling 
down but hopeful. She and her husband, Marvin, a Douglas engineer whose job 
does not appear to be in jeopardy, had a healthy savings account and felt they 
could adjust their standard of living until Ballard found work. They didn't 
think it would take longer than a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
It's been six months now and she is still job hunting. There's a fatigue in her 
voice that wasn't there last summer: 
</P>
<P>
"We are probably pulling from our savings in terms of maintaining some rental 
properties that we have. I guess we still have the attitude that two weeks from 
now I'll have a job. But it's been six months, and you finally realize it's not 
going to turn around in two weeks. With the economy going down, you kind of 
realize, too, that you aren't the only one down here." 
</P>
<P>
Ballard still scours the classifieds and attends job fairs. 
</P>
<P>
"You reach out to anyone you can think of," she said. "You find yourself 
telling people in the supermarket that you're out of a job and looking. It's 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
The Ballards have tried to keep a lid on expenses, but are still eating in 
restaurants. "We might go to less expensive places, but we still go out to 
dinner. Maybe we're keeping our head in the sand, but I guess we feel that this 
is our social level and these are the things we like to do." 
</P>
<P>
The hardest part about not having a regular schedule, said Ballard, is getting 
motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"I find myself not functioning, not making things happen around the house, such 
as wallpapering the bathroom," she said. "I am the type of person who is better 
organized if I have something to do." 
</P>
<P>
And, the insensitivity of well-meaning friends and relatives can compound the 
misery of job hunting, she said. 
</P>
<P>
"Everyone says, 'You must enjoy this -- being home, being a lady of leisure.' 
Well, that really wore off after two months -- sleeping late, doing my own 
gardening. And everybody looks at the multitude of jobs in the classifieds, but 
they don't realize that the job that looks so terrific in the paper is in Santa 
Monica and you'd be driving two hours each way or have to take a 50% cut in the 
salary you used to make." 
</P>
<P>
After the holidays, Ballard figures she'll have to lower her sights: "I think I 
would accept even less salary, maybe even a less senior position, or drive a 
little farther than I'd like. Or maybe I'm not supposed to be working that job 
(facilities engineer). Maybe I should go to work selling blouses. 
</P>
<P>
"Some of my job skills are unusual for women, and then I wonder if I'm not 
getting the jobs because I'm a woman. Then I look at myself in the mirror and 
say, 'Well, you really look like a real estate lady, maybe you should do that . 
. . . ' "

REVOLT: THE MAN WHO SPARKED THE ROMANIAN REVOLUTION LAST CHRISTMAS IS STILL 
ENGAGED IN THE STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
In 1989 Laszlo Tokes was lifted from obscurity to history. The hand of fate was 
active again this year, but the consequences were crueler -- personally and 
politically. 
</P>
<P>
Two brothers of the Reformed Church pastor and revolutionary were the targets 
of apparent assassination attempts. 
</P>
<P>
Tokes himself -- an ethnic Hungarian credited with sparking the Romanian 
revolution late last year -- was severely injured in a car accident in Hungary 
in August, four months after a swing through the United States and Canada that 
included Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
And in early December, Tokes cut short his convalescence at a Budapest hospital 
to return to Romania to campaign against charges that he had engaged in 
"anti-state and anti-nation activities." 
</P>
<P>
While Tokes had been a target in the press for months, his foes increased their 
tempo on Dec. 5 when a key figure in the ruling National Salvation Front 
publicly called for his arrest and trial. In a statement, Tokes denied any 
seditious activities against the front, which has ruled the country since the 
overthrow of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's Communist regime during the Christmas 
season of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Tokes' return to Romania, dissatisfaction with the country's new 
government peaked in observances of the revolution's first anniversary that 
were also protests of the new regime. Demonstrations and strikes marked the 
level of disenchantment, particularly in Timisoara, the Transylvanian city 
where the revolt began. At an ecumenical church service there, Tokes called for 
"a second revolution -- a revolution of human rights, of dignity, but without 
bloodshed." 
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Tokes' current problems are an extension of the controversy that 
embroiled him under Ceausescu, whose government attempted to suppress the 
culture of Romania's 2.3 million ethnic Hungarians. Then, the outspoken Tokes 
was the target of an intimidation campaign because of his defense of the 
Hungarian minority and more general criticisms of the government. 
</P>
<P>
His pulpit protests rallied his parishioners and other residents of Timisoara 
to his defense. When the government ordered internal exile for Tokes, 
broad-based demonstrations supporting him flamed into a rebellion that spread 
to Bucharest. Within little more than a week, Ceausescu was overthrown, tried 
and shot. 
</P>
<P>
In his latest clash with authority, Tokes, 38, charged that Romanian newspapers 
portrayed him as "a traitor, an anti-Romanian chauvinist, Transylvanian 
irredentist, CIA spy, an agent of the Hungarian or the former Romanian secret 
service, thereby inciting hatred not only against my person but generally 
against the Hungarian minority . . . . " 
</P>
<P>
He added, "As a committed advocate of peaceful social changes, national 
cohesion and reconciliation of ethnic minorities, I repeatedly and firmly raise 
my voice against the destructive, inciting, divisive, destabilizing attempts of 
provocation that endanger the Romanian national democratic progress and the 
success of national reconciliation." 
</P>
<P>
Yet despite the broken pelvis that confined him to a hospital bed and the 
political battles that now engage him, Tokes had a few good moments in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
On May 8 he was elevated to bishop of the Reformed Church in Oradea, Romania, a 
diocese with 500,000 people. Tokes used the ordination ceremony to call for his 
church to remain politically active in post-Communist Romania. Also in May, 
Tokes was awarded a Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms prize for his role in 
the overthrow of Romania's totalitarian state. Another recipient of the prize 
was Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel. 
</P>
<P>
Although foul play is not suspected in Tokes' accident, attempted 
assassinations were made against his two brothers, according to press reports. 
In June, Jozsef Tokes was pushed off the road by another car while traveling in 
Transylvania. In May, Andras Tokes escaped attackers armed with knives, 
apparently members of the nationalist Vatra Romanesca (Romanian Hearth) 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
In the still murky and violent world of Romanian politics, Tokes must have 
round-the-clock protection, says Emese Latkoczy, a director of the New 
York-based Hungarian Human Rights Foundation which sponsored Tokes' tour of 
North America. 
</P>
<P>
Latkoczy, who visited Tokes in September, adds, "The secret police are as 
active as ever . . . . Certainly Tokes has bodyguards which are his own. 
They're not state-provided."

I never want it said that I don't love "airplane literature." I do! What the 
world needs, as much as fluorescent lights, or elastic waistbands on skirts, or 
really excellent french fries, is splendid airplane literature (otherwise known 
as post-operative literature) -- the kind where, when you pick up the book, all 
turbulence falls away, all fear of pain disappears and death itself seems a 
pale mirage. 
</P>
<P>
Every few months or so, I write these reviews on a plane, as I do this moment. 
Across the aisle, a woman is reading Sidney Sheldon's "Memories of Midnight." 
She is one lucky woman. I flew into this place reading Robin Cook's "Vital 
Signs," and will fly out of this place writing the review. 
</P>
<P>
If I ever catch this doctor-writer Cook on solid ground, he's going to have 
plenty to answer for. "Vital Signs" is as dreary as a game show, as unthrilling 
as the last car chase you saw on TV, as wretched as the kid two seats back from 
me, screaming and throwing up. I need hardship pay for this one. 
</P>
<P>
Here's the story: Dr. Marissa Blumenthal, a feisty pediatrician, has just 
married a four-star jerk named Robert who whines incessantly about money. 
(Robert is so awful that an ordinary woman would never go out with him more 
than once, but the author wants Marissa married to him, so, OK. Marissa 
desperately wants a baby by this subhuman specimen, so, OK.) She goes to a 
private woman's clinic, whose records are totally confidential, because she 
doesn't want any other doctors gossiping about her personal medical condition. 
With nothing wrong with her yet, Marissa goes in for a "routine" medical 
procedure, where a mysterious Asian pokes a foot-long needle far into her 
reproductive organs. 
</P>
<P>
OK, OK! This is, after all, Robin Cook: medical porn is his metier. But all 
that anyone ever really wants in these "popular" novels is escape, blessed 
escape, and with those foot-long needles, escape is out of the question. The 
reader is imprisoned with dreadful prose, horrible bickering characters, and a 
lot of stuff about a kind of tuberculosis not often found in the modern world, 
but turning up pretty often in the fallopian tubes of upper-middle-class women 
who have come into these "confidential clinics" first for routine female 
problems and then finally for in-vitro fertilization. Generally speaking, these 
women have success after about eight or 10 tries. 
</P>
<P>
There comes a moment in this book where you just throw up your hands. We're 
talking a Pacific Rim heroin-smuggling cartel, whose members sterilize innocent 
American women with "barefoot doctors" recruited from the People's Republic of 
China, just as a sideline. 
</P>
<P>
Marissa gets wind of all this, journeys to Australia, where the headquarters of 
this dastardly headquarters is reputed to be. (By this time her own fallopian 
tubes have been trashed, so she has nothing to lose when she befriends 
Tristram, a handsome, Outback pilot/doctor who has already been cursed by the 
aforementioned cartel.) They begin a chase after these Pacific Rim villains. 
</P>
<P>
And everything changes! Marissa's girlfriend, Wendy, is gutted by sharks in the 
Great Barrier Reef. Tristram and Marissa check into Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel 
. . . without any trouble! (This checking in to hotels without trouble happens 
three separate times in this exciting novel.) 
</P>
<P>
Also, at least three times, Asian villains "melt into the crowd." They don't 
"disappear," they don't "run," they don't "scramble"; they "melt," every time. 
</P>
<P>
You could describe this, then, as a melt-and-check-in novel. 
</P>
<P>
The medical problem is far-fetched. The slur on the People's Republic is 
uncalled for. The search for the drug triads is boring beyond words. 
</P>
<P>
This isn't at all a question of "popular" versus "literary" fiction. 
</P>
<P>
From the grave, Louis L'Amour keeps sending his readers wonderful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
Sidney Sheldon, whether you admit to reading him or not, is marvelous when your 
marriage is falling apart, or your appendix ruptures, or the wind shear is 
acting up just as your plane comes in for a landing. 
</P>
<P>
Jacqueline Briskin weaves her carefully researched novels with as many perfect 
threads as a beautifully worked Oriental rug. 
</P>
<P>
Dr. Richard Selzer, our other medical literary man, is a genius with language. 
</P>
<P>
And Judith Krantz works and works to obtain the effects of her hard-earned 
glitz. 
</P>
<P>
What is it with this Robin Cook? 
</P>
<P>
Lazy is the word that most accurately describes his prose. His career today is 
totally assured. But that doesn't mean we have to read him -- in the air, or on 
the ground.

COUNTING OUT MOST OF THE YEAR'S TOP RECORDS; 
</P>
<P>
POP MUSIC: NO MORE THAN FOUR OF 1990'S NO. 1 SONGS WILL BE CONSIDERED 
SIGNIFICANT A DECADE FROM NOW. HERE ARE SOME THAT MIGHT.

<P>
Beware. 
</P>
<P>
If you listen to the radio tonight, the chances are you'll hear a lot of 
records by New Kids on the Block, Janet Jackson, Phil Collins, Paula Abdul, 
Michael Bolton, M.C. Hammer, Aerosmith, Bell Biv Devoe, Taylor Dayne and Wilson 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
They were the 10 most popular recording artists of 1990 -- according to 
Billboard magazine -- and radio programmers, too, love to reminisce on New 
Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
Not that they are doing us any favor with a musical count-down based on this 
year's pop charts. 
</P>
<P>
It was bad enough being bored by most of those artists during the last 12 
months without having to be subjected to them again on a night reserved for 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
Each of us probably enjoys the music of two or three of the names, but there is 
such little genuine creative spark in the over-all list that we are reminded 
why pop radio continues to be a wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of seeking records that challenge and inspire, stations specialize in 
music that comforts by recycling proven formulas or that entertains on a 
superficial level. 
</P>
<P>
The good news is that time has a way of over-riding the the sales charts and 
honoring the true achievements of a given year. 
</P>
<P>
Look, for instance, at the charts from 10 years ago. How many of the 16 records 
that made No. 1 on the Billboard weekly sales list in 1980 tell us about life 
that year or represent a link to the serious pop currents of the past decade? 
</P>
<P>
The records: K.C. &amp; the Sunshine Band's "Please Don't Go," Michael 
Jackson's "Rock With You," Captain &amp; Tennille's "Do That to Me One More 
Time," Queen's "Crazy Little Thing Called Love," Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in 
the Wall," Blondie's "Call Me," Lipps, Inc.'s "Funkytown,," Paul McCartney 
&amp; Wings' "Coming Up," Billy Joel's "It's Still Rock and Roll to Me," Olivia 
Newton-John's "Magic," Christopher Cross' "Sailing," Diana Ross' "Upside Down," 
Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust," Barbra Streisand's "Woman in Love," Kenny 
Rogers' "Lady" and John Lennon's "Starting Over." 
</P>
<P>
Maybe four? 
</P>
<P>
Remember, 1980 was the year that gave us such breakthrough albums as the 
Clash's "London Calling," Bruce Springsteen's "The River," Talking Heads' 
"Remain in Light," "Prince's "Dirty Mind," the Pretenders' "The Pretenders" and 
X's "Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
And what about this year? 
</P>
<P>
Here are the records that reached No. 1 on the pop charts during 1990: Phil 
Collins' "Another Day in Paradise," Michael Bolton's "How Am I Supposed to Live 
Without You," Paula Abdul's "Opposites Attract," Janet Jackson's "Escapade" and 
"Black Cat," Alannah Myles' "Black Velvet," Taylor Dayne's "Love Will Lead You 
Back," Tommy Page's "I'll Be Your Everything," Sinead O'Connor's "Nothing 
Compares 2 U," Madonna's "Vogue," and Roxette's "It Must Have Been Love." 
</P>
<P>
Plus: New Kids on the Block's "Step By Step," Glen Medeiros' "She Ain't Worth 
It," Mariah Carey's "Vision of Love" and "Love Takes Time," Sweet Sensation's 
"If Wishes Came True," Jon Bon Jovi's "Blaze of Glory," Wilson Phillips' 
"Release Me," Nelson's "Love and Affection," Maxi Priest's "Close to You," 
George Michaels' "Praying for Time," James Ingram's "I Don't Have the Heart," 
Vanilla Ice's "Ice Ice Baby," Whitney Houston's "I'm Your Baby Tonight" and 
Stevie B's "Because I Love You." 
</P>
<P>
My guess, again, is that no than four will be considered significant a decade 
from now. 
</P>
<P>
This year-end edition of the Alternative Top 10 offers a New Year's Eve 
countdown that is likely to stand the test of time -- the singles and album 
tracks that represented the richest currents of pop music during the year. 
</P>
<P>
But first, some honorable mentions -- focusing on artists whose records twisted 
pop boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
* Was (Not Was)' "Papa Was a Rollin' Stone" (Chrysalis) -- A marvelous update 
of the old Temptations hit that not only adds an aggressive rap consciousness, 
but also combats the sentimentality of the original song by confronting "Papa" 
for having abandoned his family. 
</P>
<P>
Sample rap: I want to forget the little bit I know / And make sure I never sink 
so low / 'Cos I want my kids to grow up and know / That I was always there 
because I loved them so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dwight Yoakam's "Turn It On, Turn It Up, Turn Me Lose" (Reprise) -- Los 
Angeles-based Yoakam isn't highly regarded in Nashville, but he brings a rock 
sensibility to country. In this lively, bittersweet bar-room tale, he recalls 
earlier links between country and rock -- both in the Johnny Cash records of 
the '50s and the Buck Owens hits of the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
* Tevin Campbell's "Round and Round " (Paisley Park/Warner Bros.) -- When is 
the last time Prince got upstaged on his own album? You may have to go all the 
way back to Michael Jackson and Frankie Lymon to find a teen-ager who make a 
record quite as ear-catching as this. 
</P>
<P>
* Ice Cube's "Who's the Mack" (Priority) -- M.C. Hammer and Vanilla Ice may 
have brought rap to the mainstream during 1990, but the artistic pulse of the 
music remains in the hard-core artists, including Los Angeles' Ice Cube. The 
language is still too blunt for radio, but the theme -- about less obvious ways 
to hustle -- is less brutally combative than most of Ice Cube's recordings. 
</P>
<P>
* Tony! Toni! Tone!'s "The Blues" (Wing) -- This Oakland outfit mixes 
traditional and modern R&amp;B currents with invention and humor. 
</P>
<P>
* C+C Music Factory's "Gonna Make You Sweat" (Columbia) -- Splendid dance 
record with a clever mix of rap and frenzied, gospel-edged vocal outbursts. 
</P>
<P>
* Concrete Blonde's "Joey" (I.R.S.) -- The drama and passion of old Phil 
Spector hits mixed with contemporary rock anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
Now, the official New Year's Eve countdown: 
</P>
<P>
10. Garth Brooks' "Friends in Low Places" (Capitol) -- A rowdy, good-natured 
underdog tale by the man who is at the forefront of country music's return to 
classic blue-collar themes and honky-tonk musical character. 
</P>
<P>
9. Neneh Cherry's "I've Got You Under My Skin" (Chrysalis) -- A bold reworking 
of the Cole Porter standard in which a hip-hop beat heightens the drama and 
punch of Cherry's AIDS awareness message. 
</P>
<P>
8. Deee-Lite's "Groove Is in the Heart" (Elektra) -- Irresistible dance-floor 
spunk from a concept-conscious New York trio. 
</P>
<P>
7 -- Jane's Addiction's "Stop" (Warner Bros.) -- More than anything else on 
record by this hard-rocking Los Angeles band, "Stop" reflects the almost 
intoxicating energy surge that the group offers in its best moments on stage. 
</P>
<P>
6. The Jesus and Mary Chain's "Head On" (Warner Bros.) -- Something to play 
whenever someone says that rock 'n' roll has lost its power and heart. 
</P>
<P>
5. Faith No More's "Epic" (Slash/Reprise) -- One of the most radical rock 
records in ages: a blend of rap, metal and punk that that is a marvelous update 
of the Rolling Stones' "Satisfaction." 
</P>
<P>
4. Don Henley's "The Heart of the Matter" (Geffen) -- The former Eagles 
co-leader's best songs continue reflect on personal relationships in ways that 
also seem to define the times. Sample lines: These times are so uncertain / 
There's a yearning undefined / . . . people filed with rage . . . / How can 
love survive in such a graceless age? 
</P>
<P>
3. Madonna's Vogue (Sire) -- No record better defined mass pop culture in 1990, 
from the dance-based exuberance and fashion consciousness to the continuing 
video drift toward style over substance. "Vogue" had style and grace and wit: 
"Strike a pose," indeed. One of two records on the list that actually made it 
to No. 1 during the year. 
</P>
<P>
2. Public Enemy's "Welcome to the Terrordome" (Def Jam/Columbia) -- One of the 
most emotionally charged bursts of artistic fury since Dylan's "Highway 61 
Revisited" days. A five-minute declaration and defense of a rapper's musical 
style and artistic impulses. 
</P>
<P>
1. Sinead O'Connor's "Nothing Compares 2 U" (Chrysalis) -- It may be an old 
Prince song, but the vocal was simply astonishing . . . so passionate, intimate 
and inspired that that the record could either be taken as an expression of 
spiritual longing or romantic loss. One reason why O'Connor was the artist of 
the year in pop.

IT'S COMING UP ROSES -- AND THORNS; 
</P>
<P>
RADIO: TWO STATIONS WILL OFFER THEIR OWN SATIRIC COMMENTARY ON THE ROSE PARADE. 
THEY'LL EVEN BROADCAST A PORTION OF THEIR SHOWS TOGETHER. 
</P>

Everybody makes fun of the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
But two Los Angeles radio stations really make fun of the Rose Parade. 
</P>
<P>
Both KPFK, 90.7 FM, and KSLX, 97.1 FM, will offer their traditional lampoons of 
the flowery fiesta New Year's morning. The stations invite listeners to tune 
their television sets to KTTV Channel 11, which is broadcasting the parade from 
8-10:30 a.m. without commercials, but then turn down the sound. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of listening to the happy patter of the television hosts, viewers who 
want a little cynicism that early in the morning then turn up the sound on KPFK 
or KSLX, and listen to the commentary provided by station personalities. 
</P>
<P>
After years of separate spoofs, the two stations are actually going to 
broadcast a portion of their parody patter together, as KPFK's Baldy and Scout 
-- played by comedian Peter Bergman and his wife, Patricia Stallone -- hook up 
by telephone with KSLX comic deejay Frazer Smith. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a great way to send up American culture," said Bergman, who began 
spoofing the parade as a member of the comedy group Firesign Theatre two 
decades ago. "American culture basically begins and ends each year in the Rose 
Parade. America floats by every New Year's morning, and we take the cream off 
the float." 
</P>
<P>
While the two stations will broadcast together for part of the parade, their 
general approaches to satirizing it are quite different. 
</P>
<P>
Bergman and Stallone create a complete fantasy world around the parade -- they 
make up their own theme and pretend that the floats fit in with it -- and their 
comedy is mostly political. 
</P>
<P>
For example, the two plan to pretend that parade grand marshal Bob Newhart is 
really Saddam Hussein in disguise, in Pasadena in a last attempt to appease 
George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
Their program will feature a number of "guests," mostly in the form of 
impersonations done by executive producer Bob Young. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll probably be playing George Bush, and occasionally when my voice feels too 
deep, I'll do Henry Kissinger," Young said, slipping from a creditable 
imitation of the President to the voice of the Nixon-era diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
KSLX's Smith plans to be generally irreverent but more based in reality. 
</P>
<P>
"His is not political and not out to be a barb," said Shaune McNamara, acting 
program director at KSLX. "He's just free-spirited. Like if somebody is walking 
by dressed like a court jester, he may say, 'Hey Dad!' or something." 
</P>
<P>
Spoofing the Rose Parade has been a Los Angeles radio tradition since the late 
1960s, when Firesign Theatre broadcast from KPCC, 89.3 FM, at Pasadena City 
College, then an underground rock station. Over the years, KRLA-AM and KMET-FM 
also broadcast satirical versions of the event. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it because it's fun," McNamara said. "By the time New Year's comes 
around everybody's burnt out. This is a way people can have fun while just 
sitting at home not doing anything."

BRITAIN'S 'GONG SHOW' IS BOTH PRAISED, DAMNED; 
</P>
<P>
AWARDS: THE ESTABLISHMENT LOVES THE HONORS SYSTEM. CRITICS ARGUE THEY ARE RANK 
POLITICAL PATRONAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<DATELINE>
<P>
LONDON 
</P>
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Insiders call them "gongs." The Establishment says they are recognition for 
service. Critics argue they are rank political patronage. The Times of London 
writes that they are "a regular British farce." 
</P>
<P>
Whatever the view, the venerable British honors system is still going strong -- 
and controversially. It is praised by some as rewarding endeavor for the 
nation; damned by others as a corruption at the heart of government. 
</P>
<P>
Outgoing Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher refueled the running argument in her 
Resignation Honors List in December by naming to the House of Lords people 
whose chief virtue was the size of their monetary contributions to the 
Conservative Party. 
</P>
<P>
She also recommended for honors Fleet Street editors whose newspapers are 
distinguished solely by the fervor with which they supported the prime minister 
when she was in power. 
</P>
<P>
As the Times described the Thatcher list: "It was an odd mixture of financial 
and media backers and cronies, together with hard-working assistants, the 
'honor' done to the former tainting that was done to the latter." 
</P>
<P>
Still, Thatcher (who can be addressed as Lady Thatcher since her husband was 
made a baronet), apparently avoided a scandal like that which attended the 
infamous 1976 resignation honors list of Labor Prime Minister Harold Wilson, 
who ennobled and knighted men later indicted for various crimes. 
</P>
<P>
British honors are regularly awarded twice a year by the monarch, with the vast 
majority of nominees made by the prime minister and at the New Year and on the 
queen's official birthday. The lists sometimes number more than 2,000 names. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent, announced late Sunday, included a life peerage for mystery 
novelist P. D. James and a knighthood for actor Ian McKellen. Romance novelist 
Barbara Cartland was made a dame, the female equivalent of a knight. 
</P>
<P>
Additional honors lists come when a prime minister resigns or Parliament is 
dissolved. Most honors are accompanied by medals, hence the nickname "gongs." 
</P>
<P>
People are nominated for honors through a complicated system of civil service 
committees, which act before the names reach the prime minister's office and 
ultimately the palace. 
</P>
<P>
Britain, of course, is not unique in dispensing honors and gongs to deserving 
(or undeserving) citizens: Most countries have such sought-after baubles. 
</P>
<P>
The United States, for instance, has the Medal of Freedom and lesser awards for 
recipients, who range from former Presidents to Nobel scientists to 
entertainers. 
</P>
<P>
The French have varying degrees of the Legion of Honor, created by Napoleon, 
who said that men would fight and die for bits of ribbon. Germany has replaced 
the famed Iron Cross with the Federal Service Cross, in several degrees. 
</P>
<P>
Yet no country has quite the array of honors that a British queen can bestow 
upon her subjects -- and also upon nationals of other nations, people like 
former President Ronald Reagan and Ireland's Bob Geldof, a rock musician and 
famine-fund raiser, who were awarded honorary knighthoods. 
</P>
<P>
Honors range from peerages and knighthoods at the top of the scale to MBEs 
(Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) and BEMs (British 
Empire Medal) at the lower level. 
</P>
<P>
When the Beatles received MBEs in 1965, other recipients of the award sent back 
their gongs in protest. 
</P>
<P>
Peerages (usually life barons) and knighthoods (known as a "K") generally go to 
retiring political, government, and military officials as well as heavy 
contributors to the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
From a certain British point of view, one virtue of a peerage (Lord Smyth) or 
knighthood (Sir John Smyth) is that the wife of the recipient may formally be 
addressed as Lady Smyth instead of Mrs. Smyth. 
</P>
<P>
Somewhere in between orders of knighthoods come those awards more truly 
concerned with achievement: the Order of Merit, limited to 24 members, and the 
Companion of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
Towards the lower end of the scale, awards are given to sports figures like 
snooker champ Steve Davis and England soccer coach Bobby Robson, and to 
government retainers for a lifetime of dedicated service: a doorman at No. 10 
Downing Street or a personal maid at Buckingham Palace. 
</P>
<P>
By far the most numerous awards in the Queen's List go to middle-level 
government employees: heads of city government, assistant ministers in 
departments, serving officers and diplomats, postmasters, police officers, 
senior teachers and those involved in charitable work. 
</P>
<P>
All recipients of awards are entitled to put the initials after their names in 
descending order of precedence. Hence, former Foreign Secretary Lord 
Carrington, KG (Knight of the Garter), CH (Companion of Honor), KCMG (Knight 
Commander of the Order of St. Michael and St. George), MC (Military Cross), PC 
(Privy Counselor). 
</P>
<P>
Most royal orders have several degrees: The Order of the British Empire, for 
instance, has Knight (or Dame) Grand Cross, Knight Commander, Commander, 
Officer, and Member. 
</P>
<P>
When author Nancy Mitford was given a CBE, she remarked: "I didn't think there 
was a BE any longer." 
</P>
<P>
The Most Distinguished Order of St. Michael and St. George is generally 
reserved for foreign service officers. The degrees are referred to around the 
Foreign Office, in ascending order, as CMG (Call Me God); KCMG (Kindly Call Me 
God); GCMG (God Calls Me God). 
</P>
<P>
The top order of knighthood is The Most Noble Order of the Garter, founded in 
1348, whose 24 members are personally selected by the queen, and include former 
Labor Prime Ministers Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. 
</P>
<P>
One gruff old duffer who was a friend of the Royal Family, on being named a KG, 
reportedly remarked: "What I like about it is there's no bloody nonsense about 
merit." 
</P>
<P>
Most recipient of honors receive them personally from the queen in an 
investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace that may come several weeks after the 
announcement, depending on the numbers of the awards and her schedule. 
</P>
<P>
Though egalitarian critics may deplore it, the honors system follows a hallowed 
British tradition: The aristocracy itself is based on the fact that monarchs 
have always rewarded favorites -- competent or not -- with titles, lands and 
privileges. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the custom of awarding knighthoods can be traced back to the 9th 
Century under King Albert the Great. On inheriting the crown in 1603, James VI 
of Scotland created 906 knights within four months, dubbing 46 before breakfast 
on one morning alone. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier this century, Prime Minister David Lloyd George openly sold honors as a 
way of raising funds for his Liberal Party. His bagman, Maundy Gregory, 
flagrantly listed the going rate for peerages at 100,000 pounds, then about 
$500,000; baronetcies (heredity knighthoods) at 30,000 pounds, and knighthoods 
at 10,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
The resulting uproar led King George V to declare Lloyd George's freewheeling 
style with honors an insult to the monarchy, and a Political Honors Scrutiny 
Committee was set up to evaluate submissions. 
</P>
<P>
The Labor governments also did not award heredity peerages but created only 
barons for life; the title does not pass through the male line as is customary 
for lords. 
</P>

Peers sit in the House of Lords and range from dukes, through marquesses, 
earls, viscounts and barons. Sir Winston Churchill, KG, was reportedly offered 
a dukedom but declined in order to sit in his beloved House of Commons. 
</P>
<P>
Thatcher restored the practice of granting honors for political service to 
faithful Tory party retainers and contributors, and she also recommended three 
heredity peerages: the traditional earldom for former Prime Minister Harold 
Macmillan (Wilson and Callaghan accepted only life peerages) and viscountcies 
for former Deputy Prime Minister William Whitelaw and former Speaker of the 
House George Thomas.

Hundreds of Albanians streamed into Greece on Sunday in the biggest one-day 
exodus since their country's Communist rulers began a reform program, and 
Albania announced it is also allowing Jews to depart. 
</P>
<P>
Thirty-seven Jews, all related, flew to Rome from the Albanian capital en route 
to Israel, said Shula Bahat, a spokeswoman for the American Jewish Committee in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
She said Sunday's flight was the first in a planned operation dubbed "Flying 
Carpet" to whisk an estimated 500 Jews out of Albania. 
</P>
<P>
Vladimir Prela, head of the Albanian Foreign Ministry's press office, said the 
Jewish emigration is part of a new government policy to allow people to leave 
Albania. 
</P>
<P>
"If they want to live in Israel, they can do so," Prela said in a telephone 
interview from Tirana, Albania's capital. He estimated Albanian Jews number 
about 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
Tirana newspapers Sunday published a new draft constitution that enshrines 
freedom of movement, as well as freedom of religion and private ownership, 
according to Albanian Radio. 
</P>
<P>
The government station, monitored by the British Broadcasting Corp. in London, 
said the draft establishes multi-party elections. Under the new constitution, 
the president would be selected by Parliament to a five-year term and could be 
reelected only once. 
</P>
<P>
Despite the reforms, many Albanians appear set on using their newly won 
mobility simply to bolt the country. 
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman in the Greek border village of Filiates said it appears that 
the Albanian government has opened its mountainous frontier with Greece. 
</P>
<P>
"There can be no other explanation," he said on condition of anonymity. "A 
mosquito couldn't get across the border before." 
</P>
<P>
At least 500 Albanians arrived Sunday, and all were seeking political asylum, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
In the southeastern Albanian city of Korce, thousands of Albanians joined a 
rally of the country's newborn opposition Sunday to urge the Communist 
authorities to postpone Feb. 10 parliamentary elections and free political 
prisoners, an opposition official said. 
</P>
<P>
Genc Polo, spokesman for the 18-day-old opposition Democratic Party, quoted 
rally organizers as saying about 40,000 people attended the peaceful gathering.

The ruling party in Iraq warned the U.S. government Sunday that its vital 
interests around the world would be targets for guerrilla attack if the 
U.S.-led multinational forces in the Persian Gulf launch a war to drive Iraq 
out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
The government also said that 350 Muslims from around the world will gather in 
Baghdad six days before the U.N. deadline for an Iraqi withdrawal in a show of 
support for President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
And in a New Year's message, Hussein compared President Bush to the biblical 
figure Judas and called Saudi King Fahd -- who asked U.S.-led international 
troops to protect his kingdom -- a "traitor" to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
"In the same way as Judas betrayed Jesus Christ, Bush betrayed the teachings of 
Jesus through his aggressiveness and penchant toward evil," Hussein said. 
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi threat of terrorist attacks against U.S. and other installations came 
in the Al Thawra newspaper, which is the mouthpiece of Iraq's ruling Baath 
Socialist Party. 
</P>
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of volunteers are now at the highest state of readiness 
to fight against the alliance of evil and aggression," the daily said. 
</P>
<P>
Iraq's religious affairs minister, Abdullah Fadil, warned Sunday that Muslims 
would retaliate against the United States and its allies if Islamic holy 
shrines are hit in any multinational offensive aimed at driving the Iraqis out 
of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
"Every Muslim will be a missile to be thrown against the enemy once he launches 
his armed aggression against Iraq," he told a news conference in Baghdad. 
</P>
<P>
Fadil also said that Muslims from around the world will gather in Baghdad for a 
three-day conference opening Jan. 9. He said 350 delegates from Islamic 
movements in more than 17 countries would draw up a plan for a Muslim response 
to any attack against Iraqi forces. 
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Iraqi Information Minister Latif Jasim said that Bush "must have 
been drunk" when he suggested Iraq might withdraw from Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
Bush said in an interview with Time magazine to be published today that he had 
a "gut feeling" Iraq would withdraw to avoid war. 
</P>
<P>
Jasim derided the comment, adding: "If Bush starts a war, he will not be able 
to stop it. . . . We will show the world that America is a paper tiger." 
</P>
<P>
Also on Sunday, Iraq said four U.S. and Western warships surrounded the Iraqi 
oil tanker Ain Zalah and that 60 Marines boarded the vessel and attacked the 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
In Washington, a spokeswoman for the Defense Department said she had no 
information on the alleged attack.

Flooding forced evacuations and closed roads Sunday in Indiana and Ohio, and a 
new storm headed into wind-ravaged Washington state with a threat of snow and 
high wind. 
</P>
<P>
Highways were icy across parts of the plains and towing services were kept busy 
with cars that wouldn't start or stay on the road. 
</P>
<P>
Temperatures dipped to numbing lows again Sunday, including a record 23 below 
zero at Scottsbluff, Neb., 30 below at Rapid City, S.D., a record for the month 
of December, and an unofficial 40 below at Porcupine, S.D. 
</P>
<P>
Since the start of the season's first strong cold wave on Dec. 18, at least 98 
deaths have been attributed to the weather. 
</P>
<P>
Two days of heavy rain combined with melting snow to push streams out of their 
banks in many areas around Indiana. Scattered evacuations were reported in 
several communities, including Indianapolis. Countless roads were closed by 
high water, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
Indiana's emergency management director said he was concerned that rivers were 
still rising and had not crested yet. Additional rain, sleet and snow fell 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Mississinewa River was forecast to crest five feet above flood stage for 
its worst flooding at Marion since 1958, and Indianapolis was due to receive 
the highest levels along the White River since 1964, the National Weather 
Service said. 
</P>
<P>
Dozens of residents were evacuated in two northern Ohio towns because of high 
water. 
</P>
<P>
In the Northwest, which was battered by high wind Friday that damaged coastal 
property and knocked down trees and power lines, the weather service issued 
another winter storm warning for the Puget Sound area and upgraded a storm 
watch to a storm warning for north-central and northeastern Washington. 
</P>
<P>
The storm also knocked out power to about 150,000 utility customers.

The father of a brain-damaged patient at the hospital where Nancy Cruzan was 
allowed to die after a court fight has been blocked from moving his daughter to 
a state where her feeding tube could be removed with less legal strife. 
</P>
<P>
Pete Busalacchi says his daughter should be allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
But Don Lamkins, director of the Missouri Rehabilitation Center, contends 
Christine Busalacchi has mental functions and responds to commands. 
</P>
<P>
Christine Busalacchi, 20, has spent 3 1/2 years in a vegetative state similar 
to that of Cruzan, who died after becoming a focus of national debate and a 
landmark U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the right to die. 
</P>
<P>
The Busalacchi case renewed warnings Sunday from euthanasia opponents that a 
"tidal wave" of death for hopeless patients would result from the Cruzan case. 
</P>
<P>
Lamkins said Sunday that a 10-day restraining order issued Saturday will give 
doctors time to examine Christine Busalacchi. A judge has scheduled a Jan. 8 
hearing to hear results of the tests. 
</P>
<P>
Busalacchi said that he was angry and frustrated about the legal action. 
</P>
<P>
"My feeling is my daughter died a long time ago, and all that's left is just a 
machine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"I will not see my daughter held prisoner in Missouri." 
</P>
<P>
Busalacchi expected to move his daughter on Saturday to Minneapolis, where 
specialists were to decide whether her tube should be removed.

OFFICERS VIEW GANG THREATS AS PART OF JOB; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: POLICE IN VAN NUYS REACT WITH CONCERN AND COOL INDIFFERENCE AFTER 
RECEIVING WARNINGS OF DEADLY RETALIATION OVER A CRACKDOWN ON DRUGS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
While three alleged members of a Van Nuys gang remained in custody Sunday, 
arrested in a plot to kill police on New Year's Eve, officers at the 
community's police station said such threats are just part of what it means to 
wear a badge. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a concern, but it comes with the job," a front desk officer flatly said. 
"At least in this case we're getting warned." 
</P>
<P>
The warnings came in threatening phone calls and in flyers, posted near the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys station, which promised deadly retaliation 
against officers for cracking down on drug sales along the 14100 and 14600 
blocks of Calvert Street, described by police as lucrative locations for 
dope-dealing gang members. 
</P>
<P>
According to detectives, one flyer read: "Police have been screwing with our 
drug sales. So we're going to screw with the police and kill two or three of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
Officers at the Van Nuys station reacted to the threat with a mixture of 
concern and cool indifference. 
</P>
<P>
"No one's losing sleep over it. Just something to consider, that's all," said 
Officer Randy Holcombe of the Van Nuys station. Besides, officers sometimes 
hear of death threats and plots on the street, he said. They see graffiti 
threatening police officers. "There's so much talk of that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, authorities took the threats seriously enough to issue a special 
bulletin Dec. 9 calling for extra caution among officers patrolling the Van 
Nuys area. Police declined to name the gang but said it has operated in the 
area for decades. 
</P>
<P>
The bulletin advised officers to be cautious but did not call for changes in 
operations or tactics, police said. 
</P>
<P>
"They'd be winning if we changed the way we do things," Holcombe said. Officers 
already follow procedures designed for their safety, authorities said. The 
bulletin basically reminded officers to observe those procedures. 
</P>
<P>
One officer said the bulletin echoed warnings from his days at the police 
academy. "Keep your head on a swivel," he said, demonstrating by looking left 
and right. "Watch your back." 
</P>
<P>
Still, the threat has to be kept in perspective, said Sgt. G. Tam of Van Nuys. 
"There's always a concern, but it's not something we're dwelling on," he said. 
Supervisors will continue to brief officers on the threat during roll calls for 
a few days. After that, "it's business as usual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said information concerning the threat led to the arrest of Cesar 
Reveles and Hector Aleman, both of Van Nuys, and Sergio Camarena of Sylmar. The 
men, all 18, were in custody at the Van Nuys jail Sunday. No other arrests have 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
Reveles and Camarena were being held without bail on suspicion of conspiring to 
kill a police officer. Aleman was held on $2,500 bail on suspicion of 
possessing a sawed-off rifle. 
</P>
<P>
Down a long, narrow hallway from the jail, the front desk officer stood a few 
feet away from a wall where six photographs of police officers are mounted in 
somber frames. 
</P>
<P>
A wooden plaque with the phrase "in the line of duty" hangs below the frames 
and name plates: Jack V. Evans, Sidney Z. Reigel, Randy Marshall, Paul L. 
Verna, Roger R. Warren Jr., Charles C. Caraccilo. 
</P>
<P>
According to police, 175 Los Angeles police officers have been killed in the 
line of duty since 1907. Of those, 88 were felled by suspects. 
</P>
<P>
The most recent death came in October when veteran homicide Detective Russell 
Kuster was gunned down by a man who rushed into a Hollywood Hills restaurant 
brandishing a 9-millimeter pistol. Kuster, hit four times, still managed to 
shoot and kill the man.

HIDDEN HILLS MAY ASK ITS HOMEOWNERS GROUP FOR A BAILOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY LOUISE KAZMIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
It is difficult to imagine a city humbling itself to ask a homeowners 
association to bail it out of financial trouble. 
</P>
<P>
Yet that is precisely what may happen in the affluent gated community of Hidden 
Hills, where the local homeowners association's annual budget is twice that of 
the city government. 
</P>
<P>
Obligated to pay a $1-million judgment over the next five years to a developer 
who successfully sued it, the Hidden Hills City Council has considered asking 
the Hidden Hills Community Assn. to buy some city property, including the 
building that houses City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
The arrangement, which could provide the cash for the legal settlement while 
keeping the property from falling into the hands of outsiders, demonstrates the 
strange -- sometimes strained -- relationship that exists between the city and 
the quasi-governmental homeowners group. 
</P>
<P>
It isn't that the two bodies necessarily get along so much better than their 
counterparts elsewhere. It's just that in Hidden Hills, the homeowners 
association and city officials represent the same constituency -- the 2,000 
residents of this entirely residential city -- and band together to protect 
their rural haven in times of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
But observers say that within the confines of the city gates, the two groups 
often bicker -- over issues such as office space and whether each is carrying 
out its responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
"They are like sisters," longtime resident and unofficial historian Bill 
Wilkinson said of the two bodies. "There are times when they could kill each 
other, but when they go to the prom, they will always look out for each other." 
</P>
<P>
The two institutions share the space in the small City Hall building, and the 
responsibilities of running the community are divided about equally between 
them. 
</P>
<P>
Both entities are governed by elected boards: The city's five City Council 
members are elected on a one-person, one-vote basis, and the community 
association's seven directors are elected under a one-property, one-vote 
system. 
</P>
<P>
The association is the older of the two institutions. It derives its powers 
from the covenants, codes and restrictions written when developer A. E. Hanson 
-- who was landscape architect to stars such as Mary Pickford and Douglas 
Fairbanks -- founded the community in the late 1950s. Hanson also established 
the community of Rolling Hills on Palos Verdes Peninsula, where the homeowners 
group operates under similar rules. 
</P>
<P>
The CC&amp;Rs, which every property owner must agree to, give the association 
responsibility for such tasks as maintaining the roads and trails within the 
gates, trimming the trees and enforcing the community's aesthetic standards -- 
in other words, making sure that no properties are allowed to become eyesores. 
</P>
<P>
If, for example, a house has a broken fence or mailbox, the community 
association can order the property owner to fix the problem. If the repair is 
not made quickly enough, the association will send its own workers and assess 
the property owners for the cost. 
</P>
<P>
The community association, which also pays for operation of the two security 
gates that are the only entrances to Hidden Hills, employs a full-time 
professional staff of three and a maintenance crew of seven. 
</P>
<P>
The city, which was incorporated in 1961 and is governed by a council that 
meets every two weeks, is responsible for fire and police protection, and for 
making sure that new buildings are structurally safe. The city has only a 
three-member staff and contracts with Los Angeles County for fire and police 
services and with private firms to run its planning department. 
</P>
<P>
The city also handles all negotiations with county, state and federal 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
The balance of power between the two groups was definitively tipped in favor of 
the community association by Proposition 13, approved by California voters in 
1976. 
</P>
<P>
The proposition strictly limited the ability of cities, including Hidden Hills, 
to increase revenue by raising taxes. The homeowners association was not 
subject to those restrictions and could raise additional money by increasing 
dues. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, the community association has an annual operating budget of $1.5 
million, as opposed to $700,000 for the city. 
</P>
<P>
Because of the disparity, the City Council often looks to the homeowners 
association for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
"The homeowners association has the clout that comes with money," Wilkinson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
For example, former association President Paul Gilbert said, when the city 
needed new furniture for the city swimming complex, the community association 
sprung for half the cost. 
</P>
<P>
Mayor H. Brian Herdeg said recently that city officials have talked of selling 
City Hall and one of three public riding rings to the homeowners group to raise 
funds to pay a $1-million settlement to developer Danny Lasher -- who sued the 
city for breach of contract over a failed project. Herdeg said no price tag had 
been put on the properties. 
</P>
<P>
Association officials say they want to assist the city, although they said they 
do not think that they can afford to buy City Hall without increasing 
homeowners' membership dues. 
</P>
<P>
Monty Fisher, one of the association's directors, said Hidden Hills residents 
would probably resist such an increase since the community association gave the 
building to the city as a gift several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
Instead, Fisher said, the association may give the city money to cover an 
unrelated expansion of a storage building. That would free up city money to pay 
off the settlement with Lasher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
"If we can help them, we will," Fisher said. "We are all elected by the same 
people and I don't think there is a member of this board that doesn't feel that 
we are all in this together." 
</P>
<P>
But, as in any family, relations are sometimes less than amicable and break 
down into quibbling, particularly when one group believes that the other is 
stepping on its turf. They are "looking at similar problems through two 
different glasses," Gilbert said. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, city officials and community association members had intense 
discussions over operations of the Hidden Hills guard booths. 
</P>
<P>
But the city finally relented on the issue -- whether to hire professional 
security guards or local teen-agers to staff the gates -- because the money for 
running the guard booths came from the community association, Fisher said.

EQUESTRIANS MOUNT A DRIVE FOR MORE PUBLIC TRAILS; 
</P>
<P>
RECREATION: RIDERS CALLING FOR GREATER ACCESS TO THE SANTA SUSANAS SAY THEY 
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO BECAUSE OF RAPID GROWTH IN THE COUNTY.

<P>
Those who enjoy saddling up old Swayback for a gallop through San Fernando 
Valley canyons used their collective horsepower this weekend to launch a 
campaign aimed at opening more public riding trails. 
</P>
<P>
Members of Equestrian Trails Inc., which sponsored a four-mile ride from 
O'Melveny Park in Granada Hills to a ridge top in the adjacent Santa Susana 
Mountains, say rapid growth in once-rural areas of northern Los Angeles County 
has prompted their call for the purchase of more public lands. 
</P>
<P>
"Horse people are starting to concentrate efforts because we realize there is 
nowhere else to go," said Ann Irvine, a Newhall resident and spokeswoman for 
the group active in the Santa Clarita, Antelope and San Fernando valleys. "The 
nearest trails are two and three hours' drive away." 
</P>
<P>
Irvine said the organization intends to join with hikers and mountain cyclists 
to push for greater public access to the Santa Susana Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
About 50 horseback riders ascended the mountains rising from O'Melveny Park, 
which is at the northern tip of Granada Hills, and traveled through portions of 
the 6,000 acres proposed for inclusion in the Santa Clarita Woodlands State 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
The southern face of the mountains is an arid landscape most of the year. But 
the northern side is a dense woodland that includes valley oaks, big-leaf maple 
and big-pine spruce. Access to many trails and dirt roads north of O'Melveny 
Park is blocked by locked gates controlled by private landowners. 
</P>
<P>
The riders were blocked Saturday from crossing to the northern side of the 
mountain range by a locked gate, a literal example of the barriers horse 
enthusiasts encounter in the Santa Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
Conservationists are battling county sanitation officials who are interested in 
using canyons in the area for dump sites to ease the county's mounting garbage 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a state agency that acquires land for 
parks, believes that the area should be purchased from its various landowners 
and held for public recreational use. 
</P>
<P>
The conservancy a year ago bought 145 acres of pristine woodland in Towsley 
Canyon as part of the planned Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park. 
</P>
<P>
If realized, that park would become part of the Rim of the Valley Trail 
Corridor that the conservancy is trying to create. The trail would encircle the 
San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
State parks and recreation officials said last month that it would cost about 
$44 million to buy land proposed for the Santa Clarita Woodlands State Park 
from 94 owners. Because there is no state money for the purchase, it will 
probably take 10 years to buy the land, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
In a study released last month, the area has been identified as environmentally 
significant and worthy of state protection.

DIGEST / LOCAL NEWS IN BRIEF: COPTERS DOUSE 15-ACRE FIRE ABOVE CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
About 15 acres of grass and brush were burned Sunday in a fire above Chatsworth 
that was quickly doused by helicopters dropping water, the Los Angeles Fire 
Department reported. 
</P>
<P>
The fire apparently broke out in the ruins of an abandoned house about half a 
mile north of Topanga Canyon Boulevard and the Simi Valley Freeway, Battalion 
Chief Melvin Lydecker said. 
</P>
<P>
Investigators had not determined the cause. No other structures were 
threatened, he said, and there were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
The fire was reported about 9:40 a.m. and was contained in 30 minutes, Lydecker 
said. Four helicopters were used because the steep terrain is inaccessible to 
fire engines, Lydecker said. More than 100 firefighters from the Los Angeles 
city and county fire departments assisted, he said.

RUNNING WOUNDED GET MAGIC FIRST AID; 
</P>
<P>
LAKERS: HIS 34 POINTS, 13 REBOUNDS AND 13 ASSISTS ARE WHAT THE DOCTOR ORDERED 
IN 115-107 VICTORY OVER 76ERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
With their roster besieged by flu, the Lakers tried occupational therapy Sunday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
They ran a track meet on the Philadelphia 76ers, took a 22-point lead and held 
on to win, 115-107, before 17,505 in the Forum behind Magic Johnson's big-time 
triple double: 34 points, 13 rebounds, 13 assists. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers, winners of three in a row, started the night with two shaky 
starters, James Worthy and Byron Scott, who had missed the last two days of 
practice. Elden Campbell also missed practice Friday, obliging Coach Mike 
Dunleavy, who had missed Wednesday's game, to attempt to participate. 
</P>
<P>
Dunleavy emerged lightheaded from the drill. 
</P>
<P>
"I was sick for the last game," he said, "and I'll be dead for this one." 
</P>
<P>
Sunday, Worthy and Scott managed 71 minutes and 34 points. What they couldn't 
deliver, their old buddy did. 
</P>
<P>
"Two guys were down," Johnson said. "I had to pick it up. 
</P>
<P>
"I haven't been quite as aggressive offensively. Tonight I knew I had to be." 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers hit the 76ers with a 36-19 first period and went from there. It was 
either an inspirational effort, or a walkover, take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
"That's just bull, what we did in the first quarter," the 76ers' Charles 
Barkley said. "We didn't give 110%. The numbers don't lie. 
</P>
<P>
"My rhythm was there (Barkley scored 14 of his team's 19). You have to ask the 
other guys why their rhythm wasn't there." 
</P>
<P>
The Laker lead grew to 22 in the second period. It was 16 at the half and 18 
early in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Back came the 76ers. They were zone-pressing with 7-foot-7 Manute Bol guarding 
the basket, persuading the Lakers they would be better off firing from outside. 
The 76ers pulled to 97-88 when Sam Perkins tried to fool Bol with an underhand 
scoop shot. Perkins got the ball to the basket, but it rolled off the rim. 
Johnson, camped on the other side, nudged it back up on the rim, where it 
rolled around . . . and around . . . for a full second before dropping in. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley made two-three pointers and scored 10 points in the last 2:33, but the 
Lakers hung on. 
</P>
<P>
With the 76ers within 109-103, A.C. Green scored on a fast-break dunk. 
</P>
<P>
With the 76ers within 111-105, Johnson was fouled on a drive and made two free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
With the 76ers within 113-107, Scott made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers now have three days of practice before playing again. If no one else 
gets sick, they'll consider it a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
Vlade Divac scored 19 points, had eight rebounds and made seven of his nine 
shots. Said Coach Mike Dunleavy: "He's getting better. If you play a guy, he 
grows as the year goes on. He's only 23 years old." . . . Magic Johnson on 
Divac: "I tell you, if he can just play like this tonight. I've never seen him 
attack the basket like he did tonight. Usually, if someone jumps out, he takes 
it to the other side. Tonight, he was going at them. I said, 'Wait a minute, is 
that Vlade?' " 
</P>
<P>
The Lakers came home from the last trip with a 103-point scoring average, No. 
15 in the league. Since, they have begun pushing the pace and have averaged 114 
points. . . . Dunleavy, on the fact his team had been rebounding well but not 
running: "It was worrisome. What could I do, tell them not to rebound?" . . . 
The loss was the 76ers' seventh in a row in the Forum. Charles Barkley has 
never won a game here. Since he is the senior 76er in time of service, none of 
his teammates have won in a Philadelphia uniform, either. . . . Barkley scored 
39 points, giving him 119 in three games. He now leads the league in scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Barkley, on the theory that great players are the ones who make the players 
around them better: "That's a bunch of . . . Me and Michael Jordan haven't been 
fortunate to have great players surrounding us." . . . Sixer Coach Jimmy Lynam, 
who went 52-91 as the Clippers' coach, is 134-78 in Philadelphia and up to 
186-189 overall. . . . The sellout was the Lakers' second of the season. . . . 
Lakers next: a trip to Portland Thursday night and Golden State Friday night.

RAIDERS BECOME BEST IN THE WEST; 
</P>
<P>
PRO FOOTBALL: THEY HEAT UP IN THE FOURTH QUARTER TO BEAT THE CHARGERS AND THEIR 
ROOKIE QUARTERBACK, 17-12, WINNING THE AFC WEST TITLE. L.A. TRAILS AT HALFTIME, 
9-7. 
</P>

<P>
The Raiders were 11 minutes 20 seconds from explaining a loss to a former 
University of Idaho quarterback named John Friesz and booking wild-card passage 
to Miami. Then they reached down deep and pulled out the AFC West title, 
rallying to defeat the San Diego Chargers, 17-12, before 62,593 at the Coliseum 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
The Kansas City Chiefs, who needed a San Diego victory to win the division, 
looked on from home in glee, then horror, as the rookie quarterback Friesz 
guided the Chargers to the brink of victory. Friesz only acted his age when it 
mattered. 
</P>
<P>
As if waiting to be scared stiff before reacting, the Raiders ordered up an 
80-yard scoring drive in the fourth quarter, capped by a 17-yard pass from 
quarterback Jay Schroeder to fullback Steve Smith with 3:53 to play. 
</P>
<P>
It was as easy as that. Some Raiders didn't wish to face the consequences of a 
loss to Charger players who will pick up their paychecks Tuesday and call it a 
forgettable season. 
</P>
<P>
So the Raiders survived a scare, won their division, received a first-round bye 
and now prepare for an unknown opponent. That won't be determined until 
first-round games are completed next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
A Raider loss would have set up a wild-card game next weekend in Miami against 
the Dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
"It entered my mind," defensive end Greg Townsend said. "But I didn't think 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers were accused by some of football heresy for throwing the upstart 
Friesz into real, live NFL action, but the Raiders certainly didn't make San 
Diego pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
Imagine the locker-room scene at halftime, when the Raiders pulled in trailing, 
9-7. 
</P>
<P>
"I'll tell you what, it was real quiet," Schroeder said. "What could you say?" 
</P>
<P>
With no one suggesting setting their watches ahead three hours to Miami time, 
the Raiders opted to make enough big plays in the second half to win the game. 
Four seemed to be about right. 
</P>
<P>
Big Play No. 1: Special teams man and backup safety Dan Land got it started on 
the kickoff following Jeff Jaeger's 45-yard field goal that gave the Raiders a 
10-9 lead with 13:33 left in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Donnie Elder took the ensuing kickoff and went 90 yards down the left sideline. 
Land never conceded the touchdown and tripped Elder up at the seven-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
"That was the biggest play," Townsend said. "If they score, who knows what 
happens?" 
</P>
<P>
The Chargers settled for a 21-yard John Carney field goal with 11:36 remaining. 
San Diego regained the lead, 12-10, but the Raiders took a measure of pride in 
holding the Chargers to three points. 
</P>
<P>
Land didn't only see Elder running away from him. He saw the Raiders' season 
running away with him. 
</P>
<P>
"I've got to catch him," he said he told himself. 
</P>
<P>
Trailing again, the Raiders took over at their own 20 and wouldn't give the 
ball up until after Smith scored the game-winner and 3:53 remained. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder, who struggled most of the game, was five for five on the drive for 
70 yards. 
</P>
<P>
Big Play No. 2. On third and six at the Raider 24, Schroeder found Tim Brown 
open over the middle for a 22-yard gain to the San Diego 46. After a two-yard 
run by Bo Jackson, Schroeder passed 18 yards to Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
Big Play No. 3. On third and three at the San Diego 27, Schroeder rolled left 
and scrambled four yards for the first down, lowering his shoulder into two 
Chargers defenders to make the necessary yardage. 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's thoughts: If not him, who? If not then, when? 
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had to get it," he said. "I saw the down marker on the sideline." 
</P>
<P>
Schroeder's first down set up a scoring pass to Smith that fooled everyone in 
the stadium, including the Chargers. Smith is best known as a blocker for 
Heisman Trophy winners Jackson and Marcus Allen. Once a season, around the 
holidays, Smith becomes a secret weapon. This was the time, and Smith won the 
division. He slithered out of the backfield into the left flat, accepted the 
perfect pass from Schroeder and raced into the end zone untouched. 
</P>
<P>
Most figured that was the game. Friesz, remembering all those comebacks he led 
in Division I-AA at Idaho, gave it one last fling. He threw 16 yards to Anthony 
Miller on third and 15 to give the Chargers a first down at the Raider 46. 
</P>
<P>
But on second and 10, defensive end, Scott Davis, who earlier had blocked an 
extra point, came up with Big Play No. 4 when he sacked Friesz for a seven-yard 
loss. Friesz threw six yards to tight end Arthur Cox on third down, but his 
fourth-down pass fell incomplete with 51 seconds left, preserving the Raiders' 
first division title since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
While it wasn't a championship effort by the Raiders, they came up with enough 
moments. 
</P>
<P>
"We did what we had to do," Allen said. "Guys like Dan Land, who ran down that 
guy on the kick return. Jay Schroeder lowering his shoulder on that big third 
down play. Steve Smith making the catch and taking it in for the touchdown. 
Scott Davis making the big sack. I like to think that's a sign of a champion." 
</P>
<P>
Raider defensive end Howie Long said it's the little things that separate 
champions from Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
"San Diego pushes a lot of teams to the envelope and finds a way to lose," he 
said. "The Raiders push teams to the envelope and find ways to win. San Diego 
is a minute away from being 10-6." 
</P>
<P>
The Raiders are two victories from the Super Bowl, although you wouldn't know 
it by Sunday's post-game celebration. There was none. No champagne, no 
balloons, no party favors. 
</P>
<P>
"We just won the AFC West," Long said. "See me after the Super Bowl, then I'll 
tell you we're there." 
</P>
<P>
Still, five years is a long time between playoff games. 
</P>
<P>
"We got knocked off the mound," Townsend said, "and it was a long, hard climb 
back up." 
</P>
<P>
Who's back yet? 
</P>
<P>
Raider owner Al Davis, measuring his elation, roamed the locker-room floor and 
dreamed of bigger games to come. 
</P>
<P>
"Start worrying about the next one," he yelled to Long. 
</P>
<P>
Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
In his first NFL appearance, quarterback John Friesz completed 11 of 22 passes 
for 98 yards and one touchdown, a seven-yard pass to Craig McEwen in the second 
quarter. Freisz: "I did some good things and I did some bad things." That 
seemed the consensus. "Friesz had an up-and-down day," Chargers Coach Dan 
Henning said. . . . Quarterback Jay Schroeder also completed 11 of 22 passes 
for one touchdown, although he totaled 162 yards. Bo Jackson, who gained only 
28 yards in 11 carries, refused to speak with the media afterward. 
</P>
<P>
San Diego tailback Rod Bernstine led all rushers with 114 yards in 27 carries, 
punishing Raiders along the way. "Bernstine must have a new contract to do this 
year," defensive end Greg Townsend said. "He deserves whatever he gets." . . . 
Cornerback Lionel Washington missed the game with his sore hamstring pull. He 
said the decision not to play was made 20 minutes before the game after owner 
Al Davis asked about his condition. "I said I was 90%," Washington said. If he 
had to do it over? "I'd have said I was 100%." Washington expects to start in 
the playoffs. . . . With one catch for 30 yards, Willie Gault fell 15 yards 
short of surpassing 1,000 receiving yards for the season. . . . Jackson won the 
team rushing championship with 698 yards to Marcus Allen's 682. . . . San Diego 
linebacker Junior Seau, the first-round pick and former USC star, recorded his 
first sack of the season in the first half. . . . Schroeder finished the season 
with 19 touchdown passes and nine interceptions.

MIKE DOWNEY: SPECIAL COACH CREATES SPECIAL KIND OF UNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Coach of the year in the National Football League, man of the hour in the 
Coliseum, may we introduce to you the act you've known for all these years, 
Arthur Shell Jr., the papa bear of a younger generation who somehow has seemed 
incapable of losing much of anything in Los Angeles this season, except maybe a 
pound or two here or there (mostly there). 
</P>
<P>
A liquid diet is what his players have cooked up for their heavy-duty coach now 
that the playoffs are here and the Raiders are in them, back where they belong 
after a five-year sabbatical. Although Art Shell did not get Gatoraded when he 
left the playing field after Sunday's 17-12 stiff arm of the San Diego Chargers 
-- a game that gave his team the division championship -- he does know the 
drill. 
</P>
<P>
"They got me after Cincinnati, after we clinched the playoffs," Shell said. 
"Fortunately, it was only water that time." 
</P>
<P>
Water's better? 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I don't care what they pour on me," Shell said. "If they do it, that 
means we're winning." 
</P>
<P>
That they are, and the day the L.A. Raiders undeniably rose from the dead was 
Oct. 3, 1989, when Art Shell rose from assistant to head coach and Mike 
Shanahan was returned to sender. This was their rebirth. This date marked the 
official restoration of the Raiders as strong, sturdy, healthy, viable NFL 
title contenders, the end result of their Art transplant. 
</P>
<P>
There is scarcely a voice in any corner of the locker room that has not been 
heard giving credit to Shell for transforming the Raiders into NFL 
power-brokers again, and if there exists a coach less criticized by the general 
public anywhere in the league, we cannot identify him by name. Coach of the 
year? No confirmation on this yet, but anybody who does not vote for Art Shell 
deserves a hard right-hand clout in the snout. 
</P>
<P>
He woke these players from their nap, Shell did, just the way he shook them 
from a deep slumber in the midst of Sunday's game, when the Raiders had nothing 
to show for a half's worth of work except 90 net yards and seven lousy points. 
</P>
<P>
In their dressing room, Shell dressed them down. 
</P>
<P>
"It's scary when you get Art mad at you like that," running back Steve Smith 
said. "It's like a big bear growling at you." 
</P>
<P>
Much of what makes Shell such a success as the NFL's youngest coach can be 
attributed to how much his players want to play for him. They cannot help but 
feel a bond with a man who knows what their life is like -- faces in the dirt, 
blood on the shirt. For 23 seasons Art Shell has labored in the Raider 
organization, and in 23 postseason games he played. Who could be better 
qualified to take this team to the NFL's promised land? 
</P>
<P>
Shell did more than restore the Raiders to their rightful place in the 
playoffs. He restored Raider desire. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't always know what they need, but I generally know what they feel," 
Shell said. "Because I was there, I have a pretty good notion of when a 
football player needs a good talking-to and when what he needs most is a little 
compassion. 
</P>
<P>
"If they do like me, maybe that's why they like me. Because I'm one of them." 
</P>
<P>
The particularly good news for the Raiders, aside from the extra week of rest 
Sunday's victory granted them, is that they will open the playoffs at home. The 
advantage there is neither an unduly unruly crowd nor an inspirational national 
anthem sung beforehand by the likes of country warbler Hoyt Axton, who will be 
invited back as soon as he learns the words. No, the edge is Shell himself, 
whose two-season record in home games is now a snazzy 12-2. 
</P>
<P>
What is it about the Coliseum that brings out the best from the resident coach? 
Nothing, naturally. Sheer coincidence. Tell that to Shanahan, who could not get 
the Raiders to respond at any time, anywhere. Here's your Raider story in a 
nutshell: Art Shell wins home games. Who, what, when, where. The only thing 
nobody knows is why. 
</P>
<P>
Shell's players had to flap their arms to get some sound out of their crowd, in 
an attempt to unnerve the rookie quarterback San Diego thawed out for the 
occasion, John (Deep) Friesz, who had never played one minute of NFL ball. Greg 
Townsend formed a one-man welcoming committee, flipping Friesz onto his back 
like a cowboy with a calf. 
</P>
<P>
Other Raiders were equally unhospitable. Eddie Anderson had a hand in 14 
tackles. Along the line, Scott Davis prowled and howled. Mike Harden swiped a 
pass. And Dan Land chased and caught a runaway kick-returner like a smokey 
after a bandit, possibly saving the day. These were hardly the usual Raider 
headliners, but Shell's got everybody on this team playing hard. 
</P>
<P>
"Hey, I'm not doing anything," the coach claimed. "They're the ones doing it." 
</P>

We hate to argue with the head coach, particularly one who growls, but we are 
prepared to in this case. This is your football team, Art Shell. Your players. 
You got them where they are.

MORNING BRIEFING: PERHAPS SOME BOXING TIPS ARE IN ORDER

After the National Hockey League announced that it planned to add a team in 
Tampa, Chicago Tribune columnist Bernie Lincicome came up with a list of 
"everything anyone needs to know about the game." 
</P>
<P>
Lincicome's public service included: 
</P>
<P>
"The puck. The object of the game is to see it. No one ever has. Hockey is one 
long parlor trick. 
</P>
<P>
"Icing. There is way too much of this, to my way of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
"O Canada. This is where they give the hockey scores at the beginning of the 
sports report instead of the end. 
</P>
<P>
"Orr. Generally 17 down in the Sunday crossword puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
"The crease. This is the longest scar on a goalie's face. The reason they wear 
their masks into singles bars." 
</P>
<P>
Trivia time: In a poll of sportswriters conducted by the Soviet news agency 
Tass, who was the USSR's top athlete of 1990? 
</P>
<P>
Sleep on it: Last year's Liberty Bowl drew a record 60,128 fans for Air Force 
and Mississippi. This year, only 13,444 of a paid 39,262 braved 36-degree 
temperatures for Thursday's game between Air Force and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Asked whether the Liberty Bowl might look for a corporate sponsor, executive 
director A.F. (Bud) Dudley said: "That is an area we might put emphasis on in 
the next two months. It seems to be the thing of the future." 
</P>
<P>
The Fun Bowl: The Seattle Times has been publishing "Husky Diary." Each day, a 
Washington player shares something that impressed him during the previous 24 
hours of his Rose Bowl experience. 
</P>
<P>
Wide receiver Curtis Gaspard liked the time UW and Iowa players visited a 
medieval theme restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
Said Gaspard: "We went through this one door and into what was like a big 
auditorium, or something. It was like a big feast. And as we ate there was this 
entertainment. . . . 
</P>
<P>
"And it was a competitive thing because there was a horse and a knight 
representing each section. You cheered for 'your' knight. 
</P>
<P>
"So that was real good." 
</P>
<P>
A month?: In 1990, whenever Raghib (Rocket) Ismail was available for an entire 
game, Notre Dame was undefeated. The Irish's two losses came when Ismail's 
thigh injury limited him to one play against Stanford and one half against Penn 
State. 
</P>
<P>
Coach Lou Holtz said last week: "When you don't have Rocket Ismail, it hurts 
you. It's like 'Phantom of the Opera' wouldn't be the same without that actor. 
. . . I wish I could remember his name." 
</P>
<P>
Holtz added: "I took my wife to see 'Phantom of the Opera' and she wouldn't 
look at me for a month unless I wore a mask." 
</P>
<P>
Smart mom: Tennessee Coach Johnny Majors was second in the 1956 Heisman Trophy 
voting as the Volunteers' star tailback, but in their 1957 Sugar Bowl loss to 
Baylor, Majors fumbled a punt at his team's 15-yard line, leading to the Bears' 
winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Majors' roommate, Bruce Burnham, was kicked in the head and went into 
convulsions. In the locker room after the game, the team learned Burnham was 
OK. 
</P>
<P>
Majors recalled that the first thing his mother asked about was Burnham's 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
What was her opinion of her son's performance? 
</P>
<P>
Said Majors: "She was a teacher and had eight kids, so she cooked a lot. A 
reporter asked her about my fumble, and she said, 'Even I burn the biscuits on 
occasion.' " 
</P>
<P>
Trivia answer: World chess champion Gary Kasparov, who successfully defended 
his title against Anatoly Karpov in a two-month series that is expected to end 
this week.

victory over Notre Dame for the national championship: "I'd probably go nuts."

HAWKEYES LOSE ALL-BIG TEN TACKLE JOHNSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Iowa's all-Big Ten defensive tackle, Jim Johnson, won't play against Washington 
in Tuesday's Rose Bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
Johnson suffered a strained left knee during practice Friday, Coach Hayden Fry 
said. Fry said the 6-foot-3, 270-pound senior was the only Hawkeye player who 
would miss the game because of an injury. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a big loss to us from a defensive standpoint," Fry said. "On the other 
hand, Jeff Nelson and Ron Geater will do a very fine job handling Jim Johnson's 
position." 
</P>
<P>
Nelson, a 6-4, 260-pound sophomore, will start Tuesday and Geater will back him 
up. Nelson played in 10 games this season and made 28 tackles. Geater, a 6-6, 
270-pound junior, made 23 tackles in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
If Fry ran a professional football scouting service, he would make Nick Bell, 
one of his two No. 1 tailbacks, a first-round pick. 
</P>
<P>
"He could be a running back, fullback, tight end or linebacker, he's that 
versatile," Fry said. "Most guys can play just one position. Nick has the 
capabilities to play four." 
</P>
<P>
Bell, a 6-3, 225-pound former all-state wrestler from Las Vegas, shares running 
duties with Tony Stewart, another senior from Union, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
"Having two running backs is important in the Big Ten because week after week 
they take so much punishment that it's almost impossible for a single back to 
go through the season without getting battered one way or another," Fry said. 
</P>
<P>
"Besides, we had two guys who wanted to be No. 1. We decided it would be better 
to call both of them No. 1 and have them share time than to call one of them 
No. 2." 
</P>
<P>
Once a Marine, always a Marine. That's Fry's philosophy, and he runs the team 
the way he used to train recruits at Quantico. 
</P>
<P>
"I learned in the Corps what every Marine learns, that everything starts with 
discipline. I instill that in my team, and I'm proud to say that they respond 
very well to it. 
</P>
<P>
"I want the team to do everything first class, from the way they run on the 
field to the way they break the huddle. Having a first-class attitude can 
become contagious. 
</P>
<P>
"When our young men meet the media for interviews, I want them to have their 
hair combed, the shirt tucked in and their ties knotted. If their personal life 
is not in order, how can you expect them to be in order on the football field?" 
</P>
<P>
Merton Hanks was voted to the all-Big Ten team as a cornerback, but he says the 
Iowa special teams are the Hawkeyes' secret weapon. 
</P>
<P>
Hanks, a four-year letterman, is the heart of the special teams. He has blocked 
three punts and a field goal attempt and intercepted three passes. 
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing like blocking a punt to disrupt the other team's poise," Hanks 
said. "If we can get one against Washington, it could turn things our way." 
</P>
<P>
Washington Coach Don James celebrates his 59th birthday today. And two of his 
players, tailback Beno Bryant and punter Channing Wyles, will turn 20 and 23, 
respectively, on New Year's Day. 
</P>
<P>
The dean of Pacific 10 coaches, James has a 13-4 record against Big Ten teams. 
He also has a record 83 conference victories.

SHAWN MOORE TO START FOR VIRGINIA AGAINST VOLS; 
</P>
<P>
SUGAR BOWL: INJURY TO RIGHT THUMB HAS HEALED ENOUGH FOR QUARTERBACK TO RESUME 
HIS POSITION.

Quarterback Shawn Moore has recovered sufficiently from an injured right thumb 
to start against 10th-ranked Tennessee in the Sugar Bowl, and that's the way it 
ought to be, Virginia backup quarterback Matt Blundin said. 
</P>
<P>
"Shawn Moore will be the starter," Virginia Coach George Welsh said. "We feel 
like he has progressed enough, and his hand is not a real problem physically. 
He is going to be the guy we go with." 
</P>
<P>
Moore dislocated his thumb on the final play against Maryland on Nov. 17, and 
the operation to repair it left a puffy, red scar across the base of his hand. 
</P>
<P>
Blundin said Moore deserves to start, even though it means he must defer a 
childhood dream. 
</P>
<P>
"All that Shawn's done since he's been here, he's basically been the 
quarterback that has brought this program up," Blundin said. "You have to give 
him the start if he's at least ready to take the snaps and throw the ball." 
</P>
<P>
Moore led the nation in passing efficiency this season, completing 144 of 241 
passes for 2,262 yards and 21 touchdowns. He also triggered Virginia's option 
running attack, gaining 306 yards and running for eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
He had Virginia ranked No. 1 for three weeks in October before a 1-3 finish 
toppled the Cavaliers out of the AP poll. Moore finished fourth in Heisman 
voting. 
</P>
<P>
Under other circumstances, Blundin would relish the chance to be the starter. 
"It would be a special kick. It would be. That's an understatement," he said. 
</P>
<P>
"It would be the biggest thrill for me since I've been playing sports, to be 
able to start in the Sugar Bowl. You watch these things when you're a little 
kid and imagine yourself doing it. Just being a part of it is great. 
</P>
<P>
"You probably hear that from everybody, but it's so true." 
</P>
<P>
In his lone start this year, against Virginia Tech, Blundin passed for 305 
yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
Welsh said Blundin is a smart quarterback with a strong arm and the confidence 
of his teammates, but isn't Moore's equal on the option. 
</P>
<P>
Defensive tackle Joe Hall, who lines up against Blundin every day in practice, 
went a step further in praising the 6-foot-7 quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
"I personally think Matt Blundin is a great quarterback," he said. "He's going 
to be a great pro quarterback some day. You'll see him next year breaking a lot 
of Shawn's records." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee defensive coordinator Larry Lacewell said he believes Blundin, who 
also plays for Virginia's 19th-ranked basketball team, is underrated as a 
runner. 
</P>
<P>
"You don't want to see that big red oak tree coming down the line of scrimmage 
at you," Lacewell said. "At 6-7, he ought to be able to fall forward and gain 
five yards." 
</P>
<P>
Blundin also took exception to the idea that he is an immobile quarterback. "I 
guess people have this perception that because I'm 6-foot-7 I can't run or 
can't move out of the pocket. That's wrong," he said. "I'm agile enough to play 
basketball, I'm agile enough to move out of the pocket." 
</P>
<P>
Tennessee (8-2-2) is favored.

Darryl Jenkins, a second team all-Atlantic Coast Conference tackle from Georgia 
Tech, has been especially interested in the situation in the Persian Gulf. His 
summer job moving boxes for a freight company found him working outside the 
fences that surround Ft. 
</P>
<P>
McPherson, Ga., where troops were being shipped to the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"You see a lot of families out there waving goodby to their fathers," Jenkins 
said. "While I never got to know my father, it struck me that they may never 
get to know theirs." 
</P>
<P>
Larry Jenkins, Darryl's father, was killed in Vietnam shortly before Darryl's 
first birthday. Darryl's cousin, Michael, is currently in the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
"He said he wasn't going to be over there for a month, but I think, you know, 
he's probably going to be other there a while longer," Jenkins told the Atlanta 
Journal and Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
Darryl is 23, two years older than his father when he died. 
</P>
<P>
"It makes you think," Darryl said. 
</P>
<P>
When Colorado scored 27 points in the fourth quarter to beat Nebraska, 27-12, 
the game had a profound effect on the Cornhuskers for the remaining two games. 
</P>
<P>
"After the game we were very, very quiet," said linebacker Pat Tyrance. "As 
much as you'd like to put it behind you, it's really tough to do. It carried 
over to our next two games." 
</P>
<P>
The second of those games was a 45-10 loss to Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
"I don't think I have ever seen the mood that low (in Lincoln, Neb.)," Tyrance 
said. "We set a lot of goals for our team and had high expectations. The last 
game of the season was really disappointing. It's tough." 
</P>
<P>
Nebraska finished the regular season 9-2. Georgia Tech is 10-0-1. JOHN CHERWA

In addition to the approximately 10,000 fans Virginia has brought to New 
Orleans for the Sugar Bowl, some followers of the Cavaliers already live here. 
</P>
<P>
One of those is Virginia graduate Hill Riddle, the rector of Trinity Episcopal 
Church in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
Riddle said some friends from his native Old Dominion have kidded him about his 
new home. 
</P>
<P>
"I would tell them, 'I'm going to live in New Orleans until Virginia plays in 
the Sugar Bowl.' And then I would roll with laughter because I knew that would 
never happen. 
</P>
<P>
"Well, I guess I've got to find another excuse to stay here now." 
</P>
<P>
Virginia defensive back Jason Wallace is a graduate of Bethel High School in 
Hampton, Va., as is Tennessee's Todd Kelly, a sophomore defensive end for the 
Volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
Wallace, a senior who also returns punts for the Cavaliers, said he and Kelly 
spoke extensively while they were home for Christmas.

Tennessee cornerbacks Jeremy Lincoln and J.J. McCleskey become the latest 
defenders to try to contain Herman Moore, Virginia's 6-foot-5 All-American wide 
receiver and three-time ACC high-jump champion. "He's a concern to us, as he 
probably has been to every secondary they've played this year," Lincoln said. 
"He's tall, rangy and can jump. I may need a stepladder. I'm just 5-11 and 
J.J.'s not real tall either. Maybe we can put J.J. on my back and together we 
can play one corner to cover him."

NESTLE'S NEW ACCENT; 
</P>
<P>
FOOD: THE COMPANY WILL CONSOLIDATE ITS U.S. OPERATIONS UNDER A NEW LEADER, THE 
FORMER CARNATION PRESIDENT. THE IDEA IS TO COMPETE BETTER WITH THE GIANTS.

<P>
Grocery shopping would probably fail to show up on a typical teen-ager's Top 10 
List of Things to Do. But for a young Tim Crull, shopping for food was 
something to look forward to. 
</P>
<P>
"As a teen-ager, I used to love to go to supermarkets. I'd go shopping for my 
mother. I still go to the stores . . . looking for what's new. To me it's part 
of the game." 
</P>
<P>
These days, the 59-year-old president of Carnation Co. is a player in one of 
the toughest games around: the $475-billion U.S. food industry. 
</P>
<P>
Beginning tomorrow, Crull becomes an even more formidable opponent as he takes 
charge of the far-flung companies -- including Carnation, Stouffer Foods and 
Hills Bros. Coffee -- that make up the U.S. holdings of Swiss foods giant 
Nestle. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle, by combining its U.S. subsidiaries under one corporate umbrella, hopes 
to create a company large and diverse enough to survive in the food industry 
big leagues during the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
While the consolidation may be a long and complicated process that could result 
in layoffs, industry analysts say the move will help Nestle regain lost ground 
in some key businesses and remain competitive in the tougher times that lie 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
Despite more than $6 billion in annual sales, Nestle USA is dwarfed by giants 
such as ConAgra, with 1989 sales of $15.5 billion, and Phillip Morris' Kraft 
General Foods subsidiary, the nation's largest food firm, with more than $22 
billion in revenue during 1989. 
</P>
<P>
"Nestle is starting to realize that results have been somewhat sluggish in the 
U.S.," said food industry analyst Nomi Ghez at Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. "They 
have not been taking full advantage of their size. 
</P>
<P>
"Reality is forcing them to look at these opportunities more aggressively. They 
have very strong brands in the U.S., but in the last two or three years, they 
have been losing market share in very important categories." 
</P>
<P>
Some of the lost ground has come in the frozen food area, where Stouffer's Lean 
Cuisine has been battling inroads made by ConAgra's Healthy Choice line. In the 
coffee business, Nestle's Hills Bros. division contends with an increasingly 
aggressive Kraft General Foods. 
</P>
<P>
The Friskies Pet food division has come under severe competitive pressures 
lately, analysts say. Carnation's foray into the infant formula business has 
also fizzled, and the company, over the objections of pediatricians and 
advocates of breast feeding, will begin advertsing its Good Start formula 
directly to mothers, beginning in January. 
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Nestle, like other food companies, must cope with a recession 
after the boom years of the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
"The '80s were a very awesome time for the food industry," said Ronald B. 
Morrow, a food and tobacco industry analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; 
Co. "In the '90s, costs are increasing. Some areas (such as cereals) are 
slowing down. It will not be as robust as the '80s." 
</P>
<P>
Timm F. Crull, an easygoing man who joined Carnation in 1955, knows of the 
challenges and is preparing Nestle USA and its employees for them. The move 
toward a more aggressive, fast-lane approach is reflected at Carnation's new, 
post-modern headquarters in Glendale, where employees are still trying to 
figure out the meaning of avant-garde works created by California artists. 
That's a big departure from the prints of Carnation ads that decorated the 
walls of the company's former Wilshire Boulevard home. 
</P>
<P>
"It's a statement of what our company is and wants to be," Crull said of the 
company's bold new tower and works of art. "The art here is to give our 
employees a creative environment to work in." 
</P>
<P>
As chief executive officer of Nestle USA, Crull will oversee the single largest 
national market for Nestle, which had worldwide sales of nearly $31 billion in 
1989. While Crull minds the food business, Chairman James M. Biggar will tend 
to the Wine World division and Stouffer Hotels &amp; Resorts. 
</P>
<P>
Nestle's much-applauded consolidation efforts have already begun. Last June, it 
consolidated all its food service divisions at the Glendale office. It is now 
in the process of merging the distribution networks. 
</P>
<P>
"Nestle has many sales forces in the United States," Crull said. "Do we need 
seven sales forces or can we do it better with two or three? These will be 
things we will review." 
</P>
<P>
So far, no employee has lost a job as a result of the consolidation. But Crull 
says he cannot guarantee jobs in the long run. "We don't really know" if people 
will be laid off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The advantages of Nestle's efforts outweigh any short-term difficulties, 
analysts say. Kraft and General Foods, for example, were able to cut costs by 
$300 million to $400 million the first year after their merger. A larger, 
consolidated operation "also gives you more muscle with the (retail) trade and 
better chance to get shelf space," said Ghez. 
</P>
<P>
Crull is eager to begin reaping the benefits of consolidation. "By putting them 
together, we will have a lot of synergies that will make us a lower-cost 
producer. It will also give us more advertising dollars that will make us more 
competitive with the Procter &amp; Gambles and the Kraft General Foods 
companies." 
</P>
<P>
Besides cutting costs, Crull seeks other advantages. "We can move the strong 
brands into other areas, which is more difficult to do when you have separate 
companies. Stouffers is very strong in the frozen food business, but there is 
no reason why they can't be in the refrigerated business, which Carnation has 
done very well with, with their Contadina Fresh." 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the Contadina line of refrigerated pastas and sauces has been a major 
success for Carnation, proving highly popular with young consumers who crave 
fresh, gourmet-type meals but lack the time and skills. Industry sales of 
refrigerated items total about $400 million and are growing rapidly, Crull 
says. 
</P>
<P>
"There seems to be a lot of growth in refrigerated," Morrow said. "So there is 
a lot of potential right there. That's kind of the future for Carnation." 
</P>
<P>
Nestle USA's research and development operation will become more focused on 
coming up with such products as Contadina Fresh -- originally developed by a 
company that Carnation acquired -- that take advantage of changing demographics 
and lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
Despite spending millions on research, food companies can still lag consumer 
behavior, as Carnation discovered. In developing the Contadina Fresh line, 
Crull said, researchers first believed that consumers would heat the sauce in a 
pan. Instead, they popped it into the microwave to cut down on the estimated 12 
minutes it takes to prepare a Contadina meal. 
</P>
<P>
As a result, Carnation researchers repackaged a sauce container more suitable 
for the microwave. 
</P>
<P>
"American lifestyle is like a treadmill -- it gets faster and faster and 
faster," said Crull. "People want that convenience to the point where they are 
almost willing to sacrifice taste and quality. It's our responsibility to 
develop products that maintain or improve taste and quality while giving them . 
. . convenience."

CHANCES FADE FOR 1991 BANK-BUYING RUSH IN THE STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A law taking effect tomorrow that opens the state's borders to big out-of-state 
banks was once expected to touch off a California banking gold rush. Now it 
looks as if the anticipated bonanza will be a big bust -- at least in the short 
term -- because many of the would-be buyers are having financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
The biggest disappointment may come from those who founded California banks in 
recent years hoping to get rich by cashing out via a sale once the law took 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
The new law allows banks from such states as New York, Michigan and Illinois to 
buy California banks, a right that institutions from other Western states 
already enjoy. Institutions in a few states where interstate banking remains 
restricted still won't be allowed to buy a bank here -- because the law 
excludes buyers from states where California banks are prohibited from making 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
Expectations just a few years ago were that interstate banking would bring huge 
changes to California's lucrative banking market and its $500 billion in bank 
and thrift deposits. Big New York banks, such as Citicorp, Chase Manhattan and 
Chemical Bank, were expected to launch a D-Day-style invasion, buying up every 
bank they could get their hands on, paying outrageous prices and offering 
consumers terrific deals on interest rates, loans and fees just to gain 
business. 
</P>
<P>
Now the phrases "non-event" and "a big yawn" are used most in describing 
interstate banking prospects here. Citicorp and Chase Manhattan, along with 
other giant New York banks, are too busy shoring up finances hammered by losses 
on troubled real estate loans. Loans in other areas are softening as well -- 
such as those to consumers and to finance corporate buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
"All of these lending problems have made it so they don't have sufficient 
capital to embark upon major expansion programs at this time. Those who might 
have rushed in during 1991 will probably be putting those plans on hold," said 
James Gilleran, California's state banking superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, with the economy ailing, banks are fearful of acquiring other 
banks for fear that the loans they inherit will sour. Also, bank stocks, the 
probable "currency" to pay for an acquisition, are selling at depressed prices. 
So the big invasion once envisioned is not expected to materialize. 
</P>
<P>
"It's much ado about nothing," said Christopher Chenoweth, senior vice 
president and general counsel of the California Bankers Assn. in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
So far, only Comerica, a Detroit bank virtually unknown here, has been active, 
arranging to buy one Northern California bank and another Los Angeles-area 
bank, effective tomorrow. Citicorp, which already operates a savings and loan 
unit in the state, has arranged to buy a small Northern California bank, but 
that is being done largely to obtain a state bank charter. 
</P>
<P>
The lack of interest in interstate banking is disappointing scores of investors 
who had hoped to sell their banks to eager out-of-state institutions. No one 
knows exactly how many banks were formed with that intention because bankers 
and investors are loathe to discuss it. Regulators would clearly frown on 
anyone who formed a bank just to sell it a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
But lawyers, consultants and some bankers acknowledge that it was clearly a 
factor in organizing some banks. 
</P>
<P>
"Let's face it. To be candid about it, there were a lot of banks formed with 
that thought in mind," said John Keating, chief executive of California United 
Bank, a fast-growing mid-sized bank in Encino formed in the early 1980s. 
Keating says his bank wasn't formed for that purpose, but like any public 
company, the firm could be acquired for the right price. 
</P>
<P>
Michael Conover, a Los Angeles investment banker who works with independent 
banks, called selling later on "one of those unwritten, undisclosed and 
nondiscussed things" that was on the minds of bank organizers. 
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, new banks spread like Medflies in California. Most of 
California's 434 banks were organized within the past 10 years. State Banking 
Department figures show some 323 were launched between 1980 and 1990, although 
not all still exist. 
</P>
<P>
Harry Gage, a Pasadena consultant to community banks, estimates that 100 or so 
banks formed in California in the 1980s were founded by organizers whose main 
goal was to sell out eventually, either to an out-of-state bank, a foreign bank 
or a California bank responding to the competition. 
</P>
<P>
"There was a euphoria," Gage said. 
</P>
<P>
Experts say many investors believed until recently that buyers would pay them 
three times their bank's book value, or net worth, an outrageously high price. 
Instead, banks are typically selling for about half that rate. 
</P>
<P>
The new reality is especially painful for investors and bank organizers because 
many small banks never paid dividends to their shareholders and bank stocks 
have been hammered. The only hope for those investors to realize a gain on 
their investment was through sale of the institution. 
</P>
<P>
Many of these banks were formed with initial capital of between $2 million and 
$3 million.Investment banker Conover notes that a growing number of California 
banks, resigned to the fact that they may not be sold, have listed their shares 
on the NASDAQ computerized listing service for over-the-counter stocks to help 
investors who want to sell. 
</P>
<P>
The slow bank-buying situation could change in a few years. Executives at 
out-of-state banks say they still want to be in the lucrative California market 
once their institutions regain their health. One banking law change that 
Congress is expected to consider soon would allow banks to open branches in 
other states without having to set up separate banks in each state. 
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, organizers of many of the independent banks that had hoped to 
sell out after tomorrow must wait. For many, experts said, the alternative is 
now to merge with other small banks or to work to strengthen themselves for the 
day when there will be more buyers. 
</P>
<P>
"If you've got to exit, then exit," said Los Angeles banking lawyer Paul H. 
Irving. "But you are selling in a buyer's market, not a seller's market. 
Otherwise, hold out, dress yourself up and develop a conservative business 
plan."

MANUFACTURING GROWTH OF .9% FORECAST FOR '91; 
</P>
<P>
ECONOMY: THE INDUSTRIAL SECTOR'S PERFORMANCE WILL CONTINUE TO LAG THAT OF THE 
SERVICE SECTOR, THE GOVERNMENT PREDICTS. EXPORTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE STRONG, 
HOWEVER.

<P>
Industry will continue to grow slowly in 1991 as export activity helps to 
counteract economic weakness at home, the Commerce Department said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Overall, the manufacturing sector will grow 0.9% next year, compared to about 
1% this year, the department said in its annual Industrial Outlook, which 
covers 350 U.S. industries. 
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has been slumping for some time, and Michael Farren, 
undersecretary for international trade, said service industries will continue 
to outperform the manufacturing sector next year. 
</P>
<P>
In the latest sign of manufacturing weakness, the Commerce Department said 
orders for big-ticket durable goods plunged a record-tying 10.5% in November. 
Such weakness is seen as evidence that the economy has entered a recession that 
is expected to last at least through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the Commerce Department survey shows plenty of bright spots in 
the manufacturing sector. 
</P>
<P>
High-technology industries will continue to do well, particularly computers and 
semiconductors, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
Among other fast-growing industries, the report listed surgical and medical 
material, medicines, poultry processing, aircraft, dental equipment and 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
Those expected to lose ground include mobile homes, boat building and repair, 
creamery butter and frozen bakery products, motors and generators, sawmills and 
electric housewares. 
</P>
<P>
"Exports will provide an important source of vitality for many industries, 
partially counteracting weaknesses in other elements of the U.S. economy," 
Farren said. 
</P>
<P>
Other projected growth areas include aircraft, engines and parts, and machine 
tools. 
</P>
<P>
Of machine tools, Farren said: "This is an indication that businesses will 
continue to invest in new equipment needed to raise efficiency and productivity 
in today's increasingly competitive environment." 
</P>
<P>
More than 60% of the industries surveyed should grow, and they represent about 
75% of all manufacturers, Farren said. 
</P>
<P>
But, "on the negative side, two major segments of the economy -- construction 
and motor vehicles -- are again expected to decline," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Those weaknesses would affect the economy broadly. They have a slowing 
influence on steel, building materials, household durables, wood products and 
other industries. 
</P>
<P>
Farren predicted that the 1990 trade deficit will be $105 billion -- and 1991's 
shortfall about the same -- due to higher oil prices triggered by the Persian 
Gulf crisis. 
</P>
<P>
The 1989 deficit was $109 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Farren said the department estimated overall 1991 growth at 1% to 3%, with the 
mostly likely outcome 1.3% to 1.4%. 
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development recently 
projected U.S. growth for 1991 at 0.9%.

FOOTNOTES: HEY, JANE JETSON, GET A JOB! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Ever notice how Jane Jetson, Hanna-Barbera's well-coiffed cartoon woman of the 
future, spends her time? 
</P>
<P>
Working Woman magazine has noticed: "In 1990, when over 60% of all mothers in 
the real world are in the labor force, Jane occupies her time like a 
stereotypical '50s housewife -- shopping, primping and nagging her husband." 
</P>
<P>
In consigning Jane Jetson to its Hall of Shame for cartoon females, the January 
issue of Working Mother argues that reinforcing such stereotypes hurts girls 
and boys alike. Too often, the magazine notes, the characters who populate 
these Saturday morning staples are legions of active, individualized males and 
an occasional generic female. 
</P>
<P>
Other cartoon women who came in for criticism included Wilma Flintstone and 
Betty Rubble of "The Flintstones" ("archetypal passive wives"); TV reporter 
April O'Neill of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" ("How does a competent career 
woman keep getting into so much trouble"), and Janine of "Slimer! and the Real 
Ghostbusters" ("a whiny, gum-cracking secretary who is always trying to shirk 
her responsibilities and never participates directly in the exorcising work of 
the firm.") 
</P>
<P>
On the positive side, Working Woman praises superheroine She-Ra, who was "so 
brave and tough, even the boys admired her!" 
</P>
<P>
As for Jane Jetson, the article points out that she was created more than 25 
years ago and that writers at Hanna-Barbera have tried to update her character 
without sacrificing its "continuity." Their solution, in "Jetsons: The Movie," 
released last year, was to have her do volunteer work for the environment. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Too Close for Comfort 
</P>
<P>
John Keating is beginning to tire of the coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
It was bad enough when people confused him with Charles H. Keating Jr., the 
nation's most notorious former thrift owner, and thought that the bank he 
heads, Encino-based Lincoln National Bank, was somehow related to Charles 
Keating's scandal-plagued Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan. The unwanted attention 
forced the bank to shed its name earlier this year in favor of California 
United Bank. 
</P>
<P>
Now John Keating has discovered yet another coincidence. A recent arrest photo 
he spotted of Charles Keating showed the former thrift executive holding up a 
sign with his name and date of birth on it. Turns out the two men even share 
the same birthday, Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Suuueeee! Come and Get It! 
</P>
<P>
The junk food that people eat on the job is enough to give the American Heart 
Assn. indigestion. To help head off high blood pressure and heart disease, the 
association's Greater Los Angeles Affiliate has produced a pamphlet, "Heart at 
Work Guide to a Healthy Office." The guide suggests breadsticks, rice cakes or 
unsalted pretzels as an alternative to high-fat chips and crackers, fruit juice 
or flavored mineral water instead of sugary soft drinks and dried fruits rather 
than cookies or candy. 
</P>
<P>
The pamphlet is available free from Presto Food Products Inc. of City of 
Industry.

<P>
Oil revenues of the Persian Gulf Arab states other than Kuwait and Iraq jumped 
by more than 50% during 1990 due to higher crude prices precipitated by the 
Gulf crisis, it was reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
Gulf International Bank economist Henry Azzam said the combined oil income of 
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain rose 55% to 
$70.5 billion from $41.9 billion in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam predicted that budget deficits in three of the five states -- Saudi 
Arabia, Bahrain and Qatar -- would shrink in 1990 while deficits that had been 
forecast by Oman and the UAE would actually be surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's oil revenues will jump 63% this year to $41.3 billion, Azzam 
said. The UAE's oil sales will rise 43% to $14.8 billion and Qatar's will climb 
50% to $3.4 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oman's oil revenues will increase 40% to $4.7 billion while Bahrain's will be 
up 33% to $875 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam said that, despite the jump in oil revenue, Saudi Arabia's 1990 deficit 
will not be wiped out because it is the main financial backer both of the 
multinational forces in the area and countries bordering Iraq that have been 
hit hard by the U.N. embargo against Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam quoted Saudi Arabia's finance ministry as saying that it had spent $21 
billion on the crisis, considerably more than its additional oil revenues of 
$16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
A significant portion of the incremental Saudi oil production is being supplied 
free to the multinational forces or at very good terms to Saudi allies, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia set 1990 spending at $38 billion and forecast a budget deficit of 
$6.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
Azzam said that although Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait hurt non-oil economic 
activities of the anti-Iraq Gulf allies, solid overall growth during the first 
seven months of 1990 and the jump in oil exports will result in higher gross 
national products for most of the allies. 
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia's GNP will grow 9.8% in 1990, compared to 3.5% in 1989, while the 
UAE growth rate will leap to 25% from 14.3%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
Oman's growth rate would jump to 12.2% from 10.5% in 1989, while Qatar's will 
increase to 12 % from 8% and Bahrain's will edge up to 2.8% from 2.5%, he said.

TOOL ORDERS FALL; INDUSTRY IS OPTIMISTIC

<P>
Orders for machine tools fell 24.1% in November due to the sagging economy and 
volatile Middle East situation, but they were still higher than a year ago, a 
trade group reported. 
</P>
<P>
Albert Moore, president of the Assn. for Manufacturing Technology, said other 
causes for optimism included "continued export opportunities, particularly now 
that the dollar is at a more realistic level, and the need for investment by 
American manufacturers (which) mean business for machine tool builders." 
</P>
<P>
The recent move by the Federal Reserve to lower key interest rates, which in 
turn would aid domestic production and trade, also is encouraging for industry, 
Moore added. 
</P>
<P>
November machine tool orders fell to $203.4 million from October's $268.10 
million, the association said. But they were 10.3% higher than the $184.40 
million in orders in November of 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Machine tools, including computer-assisted lathes, machining centers and 
milling machines, are used to produce a wide range of articles -- from 
household goods to heavy machinery and sophisticated weaponry. 
</P>
<P>
Economists watch the orders as an indication of the future health of 
manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
In its monthly statistical report, the trade association said machine tool 
shipments had a value of $268.65 million, up from $253.75 million the previous 
month, but 14% below the year-ago level. 
</P>
<P>
Foreign orders totaled $41.50 million, up from $33.95 million in October and 
$36.20 million in November, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-cutting tool orders fell 24.6% last month to $137.45 million but were up 
6.6% from a year ago, when orders totaled $128.90 million. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-cutting shipments fell 2.8% to $183.45 million in November and were 19.8% 
below last year's level. 
</P>
<P>
Orders for metal-forming tools fell 23% last month to $65.95 million from 
October's $85.70 million, but were up 18.8% over the $55.5 million of a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
Metal-forming shipments totaled $85.20 million in November, a 31.2% increase 
from October's $64.95 million. They were up only 0.1% from the $85.10 million 
of November, 1989, however.

Profits From Ohrbach Estate: Los Angeles dentist Gary Milan has sued Sotheby's 
auction house in New York on grounds that it breached an agreement to share 
profits with him from items auctioned from the estate of Jerome Ohrbach of 
Ohrbach's department stores. 
</P>
<P>
The Los Angeles federal court suit said Sotheby's agreed in October, 1973, to 
give Milan a 20% commission on sales of property from the estate in return for 
helping Sotheby's obtain the account. The suit said Sotheby's repudiated the 
agreement in September, 1990. (Case No. 90- 6907. Filed Dec. 26, 1990.)

'Noise-Free' Radio Signal: Korean Community Broadcasting Inc. has sued 
California Broadcasting Group for more than $5 million, alleging that it 
breached a contract to provide a 20,000-kilowatt "noise-free" radio signal. The 
Los Angeles Superior Court suit contends that California Broadcasting Group 
agreed in August to provide a "clean, static and noise-free radio broadcast 
signal" over which Korean Community Broadcasting could broadcast at 10,000 
kilowatts. 
</P>
<P>
The suit said California Broadcasting Group agreed to boost the frequency to 
20,000 kilowatts by February. Korean Community Broadcasting paid $310,000 for 
the contract, hired employees and incurred overhead costs exceeding $50,000 a 
month, the suit said. It said California Broadcasting Group breached the 
agreement in November by failing to provide a clean signal and in December by 
disclosing that it could not buy the equipment needed to boost the signal. 
(Case No. BC017876. Filed Dec. 26, 1990.)

RUBLE CONFUSION LEADS TO DOLLARIZATION 
</P>

<P>
The U.S. dollar is rapidly becoming the currency of choice in the Soviet Union 
due to growing confusion over the value of the ruble during the country's 
struggle to become a market-driven economy. 
</P>
<P>
Rubles are worth nothing outside the Soviet Union because the government 
refuses to back them with hard currency, gold or silver. 
</P>
<P>
But inside the country, tourists can walk up to a Moscow hotel currency booth 
and buy six rubles for one dollar, or 16 cents each. If they use a credit card, 
they get 1.8 rubles per dollar, the so-called commercial rate. 
</P>
<P>
On the black market, a dollar fetches about 20 rubles. 
</P>
<P>
"Confusion reigns everywhere," said Andy Rafalat, deputy general director of 
Moscow's two Pizza Hut restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
More firms are switching as many transactions as possible to hard currencies, 
the favorite being the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the huge Russian republic, who want to make the ruble the only legal 
currency in the country, have coined a word for the trend: dollarization. 
</P>
<P>
Until recently, foreign businesses had dealt only in the official ruble, known 
in Russian as valuta. Price tags and restaurant menus were printed in official 
rubles, for example. 
</P>
<P>
The rate was replaced in November, however, by a new commercial exchange rate 
that devalued the ruble from 1.6 to the dollar to 1.8. 
</P>
<P>
In his decree, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev indicated this rate was to cover 
all international commercial transactions by Soviet companies as well as joint 
ventures with foreign firms and foreign residents in the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
The official rate was retained only for international currency comparisons and 
to protect Third World countries whose debts are in rubles. 
</P>
<P>
Finland, the Soviet Union's closest Western trading partner, was so confused 
that its central bank stopped clearing ruble transactions for nearly a week. 
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, the Swiss-Soviet joint venture Sadko kept its staff on overtime one 
night to change all its price tags. Ruble prices were tripled, but since the 
new ruble was worth only one-third of the old one, the hard currency price 
remained the same. 
</P>
<P>
Pizza Hut started writing its credit card bills in U.S. dollars to avoid being 
charged the higher exchange rate by banks ignoring the new rules. 
</P>
<P>
Explanatory notes have been stapled to all hard currency menus, and Rafalat 
said the company is considering reprinting them in dollars instead of rubles 
next month to make them easier to understand. 
</P>
<P>
"The only 100% clear road I can see is by quoting prices in another currency. 
As we receive most of our hard currency in dollars, dollars seem to be the most 
obvious thing to quote," he said.

IBM IS ON REBOUND WITH STREAMLINED OPERATIONS, NEW PRODUCT LINES; 
</P>
<P>
COMPUTERS: DISPELLING ITS REPUTATION AS AN ARROGANT GIANT HELPED THE NATION'S 
FOURTH-LARGEST INDUSTRIAL FIRM PULL OUT OF A SLUMP, ANALYSTS SAY.

<TEXT>
<P>
A few years ago, some industrial experts feared that IBM, one of the nation's 
most important companies, had slipped into a dangerous slump. 
</P>
<P>
Its products were outdated and overpriced and its payroll and cost structure 
too bloated to deal with a slowdown in computer industry sales, the critics 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Instead of its sales growing 15% or better a year, as IBM had predicted, annual 
growth averaged less than half that from 1984 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, IBM's profit fell from $6.6 billion in 1985 to $3.8 billion in 
1989, and its stock price slipped from as high as $173 a share in 1987 to as 
low as $93 a share in December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
The downturn was troubling not just because International Business Machines 
Corp. is the nation's fourth-largest industrial company, but because IBM's 
health is a benchmark for the U.S. economy and its technical prowess. 
</P>
<P>
Some said IBM -- which employs more people than live in Minneapolis -- was too 
big and bureaucratic to change. 
</P>
<P>
But in the past year or so, the world's largest computer company appears to 
have executed a neat turnaround. 
</P>
<P>
Its profit and stock price are on the rebound, its product lineup has been 
revitalized and thousands of unneeded employees are gone. IBM also has become 
more customer-oriented, helping dispel its reputation as an arrogant giant, 
industry analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
"In the mid-80s, other (computer) companies started to do well. IBM was marking 
time," said Barry Bosak, an analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co. 
"Now, in 1990, IBM seems to be doing better in general than the computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"I'm impressed by the ability of IBM to make a good number of cutbacks and at 
the same time roll out what is a fairly extensive line of new computers," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
IBM had been losing ground in the product area to nimbler, younger competitors. 
Compaq Computer Corp. lured away corporate customers for personal computers, 
while Sun Microsystems Inc. outshined IBM in the fast-growing computer 
workstation market. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, IBM replaced its slow-selling workstations with machines that won 
critical praise and strong orders. It made a promising return to the home 
computer market, while selling off its low-tech typewriter business. Most 
important, it announced the biggest overhaul of its mainframe computers since 
the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
Mainframes, the room-sized computers that store huge amounts of data for 
companies such as airlines, are IBM's most important business. The machines and 
associated equipment and services account for more than half IBM's revenue and 
profit. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts say they generally are pleased with IBM's revamped products. Rick 
Martin of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. calls it the company's most 
competitive lineup since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
Analysts also applaud the way IBM handled the transition to its new mainframe 
line, announced in September. Transitions to a new generation of technology 
often disrupt orders while customers await the announcement. While IBM felt 
that lag, it was not as severe as some analysts expected. 
</P>
<P>
IBM is now "shipping all we can build" of the new mainframes, said Bill Grabe, 
a marketing vice president. 
</P>
<P>
The company needed the new machines to meet increased competition for its 
once-exclusive mainframe customers. Two U.S. companies that are partially 
Japanese-owned, Hitachi Data Systems Corp. and Amdahl Corp., offer competitive 
machines compatible with IBM models. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's mainframes also face competition from the No. 2 computer maker, Digital 
Equipment Corp., which began shipping its first mainframes in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, IBM also has increased its presence in software -- an 
area of growing importance -- by buying minority stakes in dozens of small 
software houses. These companies have developed programs that tailor IBM 
computers for specific industries. 
</P>
<P>
Under Chairman John Akers, who took charge in 1986, IBM reduced its worldwide 
payroll from a high of 407,000 that year to 383,000 at the end of 1989 through 
voluntary severance offers. The figure is a few thousand lower now, though the 
company hasn't disclosed the exact total. 
</P>
<P>
Under the most recent cutback, announced in December, 1989, IBM said it would 
eliminate 10,000 U.S. workers. The company took a $2.4-billion charge against 
its 1989 profit to pay for the severance deals, resulting in a steep earnings 
drop that year. 
</P>
<P>
IBM also has reassigned workers from factory floors and headquarters to sales 
offices, where they are helping improve customer service and beef up orders. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's transformation began after the company reported a 27% drop in earnings in 
1986, which it blamed in part on a downturn in the economy and the computer 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
"We also did some real introspection and concluded that part of the problem was 
ours," said Frank A. Metz Jr., IBM's chief financial officer. 
</P>
<P>
That self-examination led to the recognition that IBM's overhead was too 
costly. Its payroll and plants were at a level that required annual revenue 
growth of 13% to 15% to turn a profit, while revenue was growing at only half 
that rate. 
</P>
<P>
IBM also decided that it must "re-emphasize our commitment to our customer," 
Metz said in a recent interview at the company's hilltop headquarters, about 25 
miles north of New York City. 
</P>
<P>
"We concluded that, although our products were good, it was taking us far too 
long to get our products to the marketplace, and too often they weren't as 
responsive as they needed to be to our customer requirements," he said. 
</P>
<P>
That led IBM to loosen the centralized decision-making that had long been its 
hallmark. 
</P>
<P>
"There are a lot of decisions made in this company today -- important 
decisions, operational decisions -- that we're not involved in here," Metz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
An association that represents IBM customers says it has noticed the company's 
new attitude. 
</P>
<P>
"The openness has changed tremendously," said Merrikay Lee, secretary of 
Common, which represents users of IBM mid-range computers. "They used to listen 
but never really incorporated their customers into the fold. Now they're much 
more willing to talk and listen." 
</P>
<P>
Metz said the process of downsizing IBM will continue, though he doesn't expect 
another major restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's moves already have boosted its profit. For the first nine months of 1990, 
it earned $3.56 billion, compared to $3.17 billion in the same period a year 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
Analyst Cliff Friedman of Bear, Stearns &amp; Co. predicts that IBM will earn 
$10.20 a share for 1990, up from the $9.05 it would have earned in 1989 had it 
not been for the restructuring charge that slashed profit to $6.47 per share. 
</P>
<P>
IBM's improving fortunes have been reflected in its stock price, which has 
risen to about $113 a share. 
</P>
<P>
Although rejuvenated, IBM isn't out of the woods. One looming threat is the 
recession. Another is the increasing competition in the computer industry as 
its growth rate slows. 
</P>
<P>
In addition, IBM's profit could be squeezed by computer users' increasing 
interest in "open" systems, those that allow machines from different makers to 
work together. Open-system computers have a lower profit margin than 
proprietary models such as IBM's mainframes and minicomputers. 
</P>
<P>
Despite its recent resurgence, "over the long term, IBM's going to wind up 
losing market share," predicted analyst Stephen Cohen of SoundView Financial 
Group Inc. "Industry (profit) margins are going to be declining because it's a 
maturing industry. I think IBM is going to face some very stiff competition."

DEALS: PROPHETEERING SCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By ALLAN SLOAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One of the biggest problems with newspapers is that most of the people who 
write for them have the attention span of a flea and act as if readers are that 
way too. We breathlessly tell you today's news, but we rarely go back and tell 
you what happened to yesterday's news. And we almost never admit it when we've 
made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
In honor of the new year -- and because it's easier to look at old articles 
than to find new things to write about -- I would like to go over 1990 with 
you. Especially the times that I had the facts right, but drew the wrong 
conclusion from them. 
</P>
<P>
I had a good batting average in 1990, because my stick-in-the-mud kind of 
thinking came back into fashion. I think it's foolish to borrow more money than 
you can pay back. I also think that if a person, a corporation or a country is 
always a borrower and never runs a cash surplus, the lenders will catch on one 
day and cut off the money. In the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, these 
beliefs made me a dinosaur. In 1990, they made me a prophet. 
</P>
<P>
My three best predictions of the year -- the collapse of the junk bond market, 
the fall of Donald J. Trump and the bankruptcy of the Frank Lorenzo airline 
empire -- were all simple logic, if you think the way I do. 
</P>
<P>
Early in 1990, anyone with two eyes, half a brain and an open mind could see 
that the junk bond market, in its late-1980s form, was finished. Dead. Kaput. 
In the 1980s, junk was a Tinker Bell market -- everyone clapped and believed in 
junk bonds, so there was a market, even though many junk issuers were 
financially unsound. 
</P>
<P>
When Michael Milken was driven out and everyone finally stopped believing, you 
had a market in which you could buy all the junk bonds you wanted. You just 
couldn't sell them at a reasonable price. Junk bonds, to quote one of my 
February columns, became a financial Roach Motel. You can check in, but you 
can't check out. 
</P>
<P>
That made calling the fall of Trump easy. Especially after Forbes magazine, in 
April, published Trump's balance sheet. Do a little forensic accounting, and 
you saw that Trump had almost no cash cushion and his properties weren't 
producing enough cash to pay his interest bills. And that the only way he will 
emerge with anything other than his mouth is by making deals with his lenders, 
those poor souls. 
</P>
<P>
I've missed a prediction or two on The Donald, but in all, my record on Trump's 
deals is lots better than Trump's is. 
</P>
<P>
I made the Lorenzo call with help from my Newsday colleague Glenn Kessler, who 
covered the Eastern Airlines bankruptcy. I realized that the deficit in 
Eastern's pension fund could sink Lorenzo's whole empire because the U.S. 
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. wasn't letting him walk way from it. So 
Lorenzo's empire, which included Continental Airlines and Continental Airlines 
Holdings (nee Texas Air Corp.) went under, as I predicted. But Lorenzo managed 
to bail out ahead of the crash, which I hadn't predicted. 
</P>
<P>
Once you realized that junk bonds were gone, you realized that junk bank loans 
would vanish too. Which is why I was sure that the two employee bids for United 
Airlines would fail, as they did. 
</P>
<P>
When it came to writing about Macy's, though, I got too cocky. In September, I 
wrote that the company's contention that it would sell new stock to investors 
at five times the price investors paid in the 1986 Macy's leveraged buyout was 
absurd. And it was. 
</P>
<P>
But instead of stopping while I was ahead, I implied in early December that 
Macy's wouldn't be able to sell $100 million of new stock at the 1986 price. 
Oops. In mid-December, Macy's proved me wrong by selling more than $150 million 
of stock. I'm still pessimistic about the company, but I'll be more careful 
next time. 
</P>
<P>
When I stuck to the obvious, I did better. I wrote in June that a used-car 
company called Urcarco, which had just sold more than $100 million of new stock 
to investors for $19.875 a share, was making money on its bookkeeping, not its 
operations. The stock recently traded at less than $4. 
</P>
<P>
I also wrote that Kohlberg Kravis Roberts had to do something to salvage the 
RJR Nabisco leveraged buyout -- which it did by putting up $1.7 billion of new 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
In June, I wrote that Walt Disney Co.'s issue of Liquid Yield Option Notes was 
goofy, but that investors would buy tons of the stuff, even though it was 
awful. I was right. My article, which my children objected to, saying that I 
was "dissing" Bambi, prompted the following macho missive from Disney Treasurer 
Richard Nanula -- after the LYONs were safely sold: "In your face." What do you 
expect from someone with a mouse on his letterhead? 
</P>
<P>
I haven't been as clear as I should have been about First Executive, the Los 
Angeles-based holding company for the junk-laden Executive Life insurance 
companies in New York and California. I owe all you Executive Life policy 
holders an explanation of how I can say that First Exec is busto but the 
Executive Lifes may be sound. 
</P>
<P>
And here it is. First Exec has defaulted on its bank loans and preferred stock. 
But the hundreds of millions of dollars First Exec raised with the borrowings 
and preferred stock sales was invested in the insurance companies as capital. 
</P>
<P>
The insurers don't have to repay it -- that's First Exec's problem. So the 
insurance companies have more capital than First Exec, and fewer liabilities. 
That's why they may still be sound. 
</P>
<P>
The year wouldn't be complete without Meshulam Riklis, whose deals are so 
complicated that I get a headache just thinking about them. I'm not sure 
whether I was right in writing that his McCrory chain was bankruptcy bait. I'm 
still trying to figure out what's going on, and some day, hopefully in 1991, 
I'll let you know.

MARKET BEAT: FORGETTABLE MOMENTS OF INVESTING DURING 1990

<P>
Right for the Wrong Reason -- Michael Murphy, editor of the San Francisco-based 
Overpriced Stock Service newsletter, is one of Wall Street's best-known short 
sellers -- those traders who sell stock they don't own, betting that prices are 
going lower. 
</P>
<P>
The June issue of OSS carried a headlined with the none-too-subtle message 
SHORT EVERYTHING!, in letters almost large enough to be read by passing planes. 
</P>
<P>
It was a good call, of course: The stock market peaked in mid-July, then 
plunged in August with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Murphy didn't have a 
private line to Saddam, however. Instead, the veteran short seller believed 
that the Federal Reserve would be unable to lower interest rates in 1990 -- so 
Murphy saw little reason to own stocks in an iffy economy. 
</P>
<P>
You were dead wrong on rates, Mike. But just ask his happy bear subscribers if 
they're complaining. 
</P>
<P>
Clan of the Unemployed Cave Bear -- Here's a brokerage management aptitude 
test: It's late in 1990, and deep into the bear market. You employ two very 
quotable, very well known market strategists. One has been bearish all year, 
correctly predicting trouble in the financial system. The other has been mostly 
bullish. When layoff time comes in November, which one do you fire? 
</P>
<P>
Oppenheimer &amp; Co. dumped its bear, Suresh Bhirud, and kept its bull, 
Michael Metz. 
</P>
<P>
In the securities business, hope springs eternal. 
</P>
<P>
We Liked Teledyne 'Classic' Better -- Teledyne Inc. Chairman Henry Singleton 
figured he had a good idea in February: Split his conglomerate in two, leaving 
Teledyne's manufacturing businesses in one company and the insurance business 
in another. The market would understand the two operations much more clearly, 
and the sum of the two stocks would probably be worth more than the original 
whole. Hey, it worked in the '80s, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
Singleton, 73, is no newcomer to finance, and he ranks as one of the great 
company builders of all time. But maybe he should have left well enough alone. 
The old Teledyne traded for $72 a share. New Teledyne trades for $16 a share, 
and the spun-off insurance company, Unitrin, for $33 a share. So the sum of the 
parts is $46. 
</P>
<P>
True, manufacturing has had a bad year. But at least in the old, confusing, 
unfocused, classic Teledyne, manufacturing had insurance to hide behind. 
</P>
<P>
Maybe They Should Call It the Misery Index -- When San Francisco-based money 
manager Associated Capital launched its California 300 stock index last spring, 
the idea was to spotlight the success of California stocks, from Arco to Zero 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
Some success. If we had looked backward, we would have founding the index of 
300 major California stocks lagging the broad market every year since 1985. And 
this year was another bummer for Golden State stocks: The California 300's 
total return (including dividends) was a loss of about 9%, versus a drop of 
about 3% for the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. 
</P>
<P>
Blame S&amp;L and real-estate related stocks for the latest slump. In the late 
'80s, the index was dragged down by the awful performance of the state's 
high-tech and energy stocks. 
</P>
<P>
What about 1991? Look at it this way: After six years of lagging the S&amp;P 
500, it's either really time to hunt for bargains among California stocks, or 
you may as well just bag it and buy the Oregon 30 or the Utah 12 instead. 
</P>
<P>
Can You Spell I-K-E-A -- An old Wall Street line is that stocks are sold, not 
bought. Investment bankers Robertson, Stephens &amp; Co. and Bateman Eichler, 
Hill Richards did one magnificent selling job with home furnishings retailer 
Stor Furnishings International last April. 
</P>
<P>
The two firms managed to persuade their investors to plunk down $8 apiece for 
2.25 million shares of Stor in its initial public stock offering. Today, the 
stock sells for $1.75 a share, a tidy 80% plunge in eight months. 
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, City of Industry-based Stor was a capital loss waiting to 
happen. The firm operated only three stores, all in Los Angeles. Its costly 
expansion plans almost guaranteed that there would be no earnings for the 
foreseeable future. And in the meantime, competitor Ikea, the Swedish-based 
global behemoth in the retail home-furnishings business, was planning to plow 
into the L.A. market. 
</P>
<P>
So why, you ask, would anyone buy Stor stock -- or at the very least, why would 
they pay $8 a share for the initial offering, when the odds were overwhelming 
that you could pick up the shares later for less? 
</P>
<P>
How do you say suckered in Swedish? 
</P>
<P>
Here, Catch This Javelin -- Olympic organizing legend Peter V. Ueberroth and 
partners bought a controlling stake in hemorrhaging Hawaiian Airlines in 
December, 1989, for $22 a share. Some people thought Ueberroth overpaid, 
considering long-troubled Hawaiian hadn't been profitable since 1986. But 
Security Pacific Bank still agreed to ante up multimillions in financing for 
the deal. 
</P>
<P>
From there, the math got a little more icky. Hawaiian lost $26.06 a share in 
the first nine months of 1990. A profit still isn't in sight. Hawaiian stock 
now is at $9 a share, and to some analysts, it isn't worth half that. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, incredibly, Ueberroth et al. earlier this month managed to persuade 
debt-laden Northwest Airlines to fork over $20 million for a 25% stake in 
Hawaiian. 
</P>
<P>
Northwest gets a coveted Australian route out of the deal. Still, the history 
of Hawaiian -- this is a stock that sold for $48 a share in 1987 -- suggests 
that your grandmother was on to something when she told you not to throw good 
money after bad. 
</P>
<P>
Don't Do as I Say, and Definitely Don't Do as I Do -- As California bank and 
S&amp;L stocks continued their free fall all year long, some big investors were 
sure that the market was missing something. So this select group -- including 
many bank and S&amp;L officers -- jumped into the stocks in a major way. 
</P>
<P>
These people are financial experts? 
</P>
<P>
In July and August, for example, seven CalFed Inc. officers and directors 
bought the S&amp;L's shares on the open market for prices ranging between $9 
and $10.50. Unfortunately, since then, the market has had a "66% off" sale on 
CalFed stock. It sells for about $3 today. 
</P>
<P>
Northern California hotelier Ted Krutschnitt paid between $5 and $7.50 a share 
for his initial 976,400 shares of Coast Savings in May, June and July. Should 
have waited, Ted: You could have it now for $2 a share. 
</P>
<P>
The list goes on and on. Will these investors make money over the long term? 
Maybe. But they also may have forgotten one of Wall Street's cardinal rules: 
It's almost always better to buy late and sell early than vice-versa. Hollywood 
loves heroes, but the stock market usually eats them for lunch.

GERRYMANDERED: The 3rd District will be a chore for county supervisors when 
they reapportion next year. 
</P>
<P>
(B1) It extends from La Habra to San Juan Capistrano and got that way in 1977, 
after then-Supervisor Ralph Clark decided his West Anaheim service station 
should be in his own 2nd District. . . . To accomplish it, he ceded the Santa 
Ana Canyon area to Supervisor Ralph Diedrich, who then pushed his 
Fullerton-based district south to the San Diego County line. Insiders said 
Diedrich wanted the South County development boom within his control. A 
not-unrelated fact: Diedrich later was convicted of exacting a bribe from a 
developer. Diedrich died in 1988. Mike Brock and Eric Bailey

MORE WHINES: Store owners report increased sales to beat Tuesday's liquor tax 
hike. 
</P>
<P>
The federal excise tax on beer goes from 16 cents to 33 cents per six-pack. 
Higher levies on wine and liquor vary depending on the bottle size and alcohol 
content. . . . Many wholesalers are raising their prices, too, hoping the 
consumer will blame the government for the entire increase, says one salesman. 
"You can tell which ones are buying to beat the tax hike," says another. 
"They're buying four and five cases of the same item." Mike Brock and Eric

VAN TOUCHES OFF WILD CHASE AT CHECKPOINT

<P>
A van apparently smuggling illegal immigrants from Mexico bolted the Border 
Patrol checkpoint near San Clemente Sunday and led lawmen on a 40-minute chase 
through Orange County, sometimes against oncoming freeway traffic. 
</P>
<P>
The fleeing driver, identified only as a Mexican citizen, drove into oncoming 
lanes of the San Diego Freeway in Irvine and the Costa Mesa Freeway in Tustin 
but was stopped on the Santa Ana Freeway here before anyone was hurt, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
"It never really got up to high speeds," Tustin Police Sgt. Brent Zicarelli 
said. 
</P>
<P>
Officers said the van's seven occupants fled, but the driver and two of his 
passengers were apprehended and turned over to the Border Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
The van, which stopped at the checkpoint at 6:10 a.m., sped off when Border 
Patrol officers approached it, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Border Patrol officers pursued the van up Interstate 5 and onto the San Diego 
Freeway in Irvine, until the van crossed the bare-earth median strip near 
Jamboree Road into southbound traffic. Agents then broke off the chase as being 
too dangerous, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Local police had been alerted, however, and a Tustin officer spotted and pulled 
over the van at McFadden and Pasadena avenues just east of the Costa Mesa 
Freeway. But when he approached the van, it sped off, setting off another chase 
along surface streets and freeway lanes. 
</P>
<P>
Zicarelli said the officer saw the van turn onto a Costa Mesa Freeway off-ramp 
and head north in the southbound lanes. 
</P>
<P>
"If a pursuit becomes too wild, we'll take a license plate and description and 
discontinue the pursuit," Zicarelli said. But the van was not speeding, and the 
officer followed, staying to the shoulder with lights and siren on to warn 
oncoming motorists, he said. The van got off at the next on-ramp. 
</P>
<P>
The van eventually stopped at 6:40 a.m. on the southbound Santa Ana Freeway 
near the Costa Mesa Freeway, and the occupants ran off, Zicarelli said. 
</P>
<P>
"It was Sunday morning, and there was not a lot of traffic," he said. "If it 
had been 6:30 Monday, we'd have lost him or broken off the pursuit or someone 
could have gotten hurt."

THE NEW YEAR PROMISES TREMENDOUS PROGRESS, FRUSTRATING SETBACKS AND DAUNTING 
CHALLENGES FOR ORANGE COUNTY. THERE IS TRANSPORTATION MONEY APLENTY, BUT SOCIAL 
SERVICE AGENCIES COULD GO BEGGING. STRIDES ARE EXPECTED ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL 
FRONT, BUT EDUCATORS WILL HAVE TO DO MORE WITH LESS AND FIGHT FOR EVERY DOLLAR 
FROM THE STATE.

After a year highlighted by a series of development battles, 1991 opens with 
the county housing market on the skids. As a result, those issues may recede in 
the coming year. Tranquility will come at a price, however: Fewer new homes 
means fewer housing permits and fewer new taxpayers at a time when local 
governments are desperate for money. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit will be the county's growing underclass. Health services for poor 
people were cut in 1990, and will likely be hit harder in 1991. Demand, 
however, will soar. The slowing economy brings a host of problems, all of which 
cost money to treat: Unemployment means more workers seeking welfare, more 
families requesting Aid to Families with Dependent Children, more homeless 
people in dire need of shelter. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to its other budget woes, the county Board of Supervisors must 
tackle the politically explosive question of acquiring land for a new jail, 
most likely in Gypsum Canyon near Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
Environmentalists and educators will have battles of their own. Toxic waste 
dumpers will get a tougher look from the Orange County district attorney, and a 
local school district is joining others across the state in taking the case for 
more state funding to court. 
</P>
<P>
Yet, while some services struggle to get by, others will suffer from an 
embarrassment of riches: Barring a court challenge, the new county half-cent 
tax for transportation goes into effect on April 1, and new road construction 
will not be far behind. 
</P>
<P>
And even as local leaders chart the county's course through a rough-and-tumble 
year, the 1990 census will provide a new snapshot of who we are. The census 
will confirm the county's explosive growth during the past decade, paving the 
way for a new congressional seat and rejiggered supervisorial districts. But it 
will probably also reveal an increasingly diverse and complex county, one where 
poverty and unemployment have found a foothold in a land long known for its 
affluence. 
</P>
<P>
With all those issues coming together at once, 1991 promises to be a daunting 
one for the County Board of Supervisors. And at the same time that the board 
prepares to unravel its myriad budget and social problems, a political storm is 
quietly gathering as well. After nine years of relative tranquility, the new 
census findings will bring the return of reapportionment, the once-a-decade 
process of trimming territory from fast-growing supervisorial districts and 
tacking it on the slower-growing ones. 
</P>
<P>
That means that Supervisors Thomas F. Riley and Gaddi H. Vasquez, whose 
districts cover the booming areas of south and east Orange County, will each 
lose turf. Supervisors Don R. Roth, Roger R. Stanton and Harriett M. Wieder 
will pick up ground because their districts have grown more slowly since the 
1980 census. 
</P>
<P>
Although the board represents residents of the whole county, supervisors are 
elected by their individual districts, and fussing with the boundaries is sure 
to stir political rivalries. While redistricting is unlikely to affect many 
significant policy matters, it will make a difference to constituents seeking 
their supervisor's help. 
</P>
<P>
Costa Mesa residents, for instance, may soon find that Riley is no longer their 
voice on the board. In order to balance out the growth in Riley's district, 
that city may wind up with Stanton or Wieder, or perhaps split between them. 
</P>
<P>
If it were just a mathematical equation, redistricting would be complicated but 
relatively uncontroversial. But it is not. 
</P>
<P>
"I would like to think we could do this pretty quickly," Riley said. "But the 
last time, we did have some challenges, and I expect we will again." 
</P>
<P>
Supervisors traditionally use reapportionment as an opportunity to strengthen 
their political base, carving out precincts that they have struggled to carry 
in exchange for areas where their support may be stronger. 
</P>
<P>
At the center of that shuffling in 1991 will be Vasquez, who takes over as the 
board's new chairman in January. Vasquez has indicated to some of his 
colleagues that he would like to shift his district northward, dropping some 
South County precinc That would surprise few obserdistrict has caused him 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
In 1990, for instance, some Vasquez constituents in Lake Forest expressed 
dismay at the supervisor's continued opposition to a new jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
Vasquez's north county constituents applaud that position of keeping a new jail 
away from them, but building the Gypsum Canyon facility would allow the county 
to close the James A. Musick Branch Jail near Lake Forest. It's an issue that 
pits one half of his district against the other -- a nettlesome problem, but 
one that reapportionment may offer the opportunity to resolve.

POLICE SHOOT REPORTED ATTACKER OF WOMAN; 
</P>
<P>
CRIME: A SUSPECT WAS CRITICALLY WOUNDED IN THE SECOND RECENT SHOOTING BY 
ANAHEIM OFFICERS. POLICE SAID THE MAN CONFRONTED THEM BUT WOULD NOT SAY IF HE 
WAS ARMED.

<P>
In the second shooting by city police in three days, an officer on Sunday 
critically wounded a man who reportedly was attacking a woman in the bushes of 
a residential area, police said. 
</P>
<P>
The suspect, identified as 23-year-old Leonardo Macias Castelan, address 
unknown, will be booked on suspicion of attempted rape, police said. Police 
would not say whether Castelan, who is apparently not from Orange County, was 
armed. He was in critical condition Sunday night at UCI Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
According to Anaheim police, a 34-year-old woman was walking home alone about 4 
a.m. Sunday in the 2900 block of West Orange Avenue, near Beach Boulevard, when 
she was attacked by a stranger who began choking her and dragging her into 
bushes beside a house. 
</P>
<P>
A passerby called police, Lt. Ray Welch said. Officers in three cars responded, 
discovering the rape suspect as he held the woman down on the ground, officers 
said. As the officers identified themselves, the suspect "jumped up, confronted 
the officers and was shot by one of the officers," according to an account from 
Lt. Marc Hedgepeth. 
</P>
<P>
"We heard three gunshots -- boom, boom, boom, just as fast as you could shoot 
'em," said Lee Miller, 60, who has lived for more than two decades on West 
Orange Avenue, two doors from the crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
"No sooner did we hear the gunshots than the police were lined up for half a 
block," Miller recounted. "No one would say anything -- it was all very 
hush-hush, and I had to call the Police Department myself to try and find 
something out. But they just said: 'Stay in the house.' " 
</P>
<P>
Neighbor Charles Noland, 69, said he saw the victim standing beside a police 
car soon after the shooting, hysterical. He said an officer tried to calm her, 
saying he needed to ask her questions. 
</P>
<P>
Police said the woman was then taken for treatment to a local hospital and 
released. 
</P>
<P>
Like Lee Miller, most neighbors in the area surrounding the shooting reported 
hearing three shots. But the man staying at the house where the crime took 
place said he heard police say seven shots were fired in all. 
</P>
<P>
But the man, who requested anonymity, said he himself heard nothing. 
</P>
<P>
"We slept through the whole thing -- didn't even wake for the cops banging on 
the door," his girlfriend said. 
</P>
<P>
Alongside the house where they are staying, owned by the man's parents, 
splotches of blood stained the pavement in a fenced-in patio area. Police also 
dislodged a bullet from the side of the house. 
</P>
<P>
But the bullets weren't confined to the immediate area. Verda Thomas, 60, who 
lives across an alley from the crime scene, reported that she heard a bullet 
hit her bedroom wall and found it on her back patio by a glass door Sunday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
"I know the difference between a (car) backfire and a bullet, and when I heard 
that, I just froze in bed. If that had gone through the wall, it would have 
been pretty scary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
"You know, this area used to be paradise; now it's hell," she said. 
</P>
<P>
In fact, the frequency of burglaries, prostitution and violence along Beach 
Boulevard in Anaheim and the bordering residential neighborhoods has gotten so 
bad that local resident Bill McDonald, 36, said he just bought a .357-caliber 
handgun to protect himself. 
</P>
<P>
"This neighborhood isn't safe anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Still, one resident who requested anonymity said, "The trigger-happy cops, I'm 
more afraid of them than the criminals." Police shootings "just happen too 
much." 
</P>
<P>
In Orange County this year, there have been at least 23 police shootings, down 
from about 30 last year. The most recent came Thursday in Garden Grove when an 
Anaheim police officer shot and killed an unarmed man after the man rammed into 
a police barricade and tried to flee. The incident, like the one Sunday, is 
under investigation.

CITY MAY SWEETEN POT FOR COMMUTERS

<P>
More extensive -- and expensive -- measures will be required in the new year to 
encourage city employees to car-pool, ride bicycles, buses or walk to work. 
</P>
<P>
Under Southern California air quality rules, the city of Irvine, like all large 
employers, must encourage employees to reduce the number of times they drive to 
work alone. 
</P>
<P>
Irvine's first attempt at achieving the South Coast Air Quality Management 
District's goal of an average 1.5 workers per car at City Hall fell far short, 
said Douglas C. Reilly, executive director of the city's transportation 
authority. A yearlong effort of cash and other incentives achieved only an 
average of 1.11 workers per car, meaning 468 more car trips to City Hall need 
to be eliminated each week to meet the goal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
To encourage workers to participate in the city's trip-reduction program, on 
Jan. 8 the City Council is scheduled to consider an expanded program that will 
raise the city's cost from about $87,000 a year to about $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
The existing program, adopted in 1989, offers employees who come to work at 
least half the time without their cars an added $25 a month in cash, free 
bicycles for those wishing to pedal to work, preferential parking spaces and 
on-site oil changes for car-poolers, a free lunch and awards ceremony four 
times a year and other programs. 
</P>
<P>
But those incentives failed to coax enough people out of their cars, said 
Reilly, who car-pools one day a week. 
</P>
<P>
The plan council members will consider would add incentives and ask permission 
to switch more employees to shortened workweeks. Those incentives include a 
guaranteed ride home for car-poolers who must unexpectedly leave work early, 
bus and rail passes, and a lunchtime shuttle that would cruise by shopping, 
banking and restaurant areas. 
</P>
<P>
The commuter bonuses are intended to eliminate some of the reasons people give 
for driving to work alone, Reilly said. TOM McQUEENEY

CITY MAKES PUSH FOR CORPORATE CENTER

<P>
In an attempt to expand San Clemente's economy, the City Council plans to 
encourage large companies to move their headquarters here. 
</P>
<P>
At its last meeting, the council directed Community Development Director Jim 
Holloway to lobby the Arvida Co. to establish a corporate center in the 
proposed Tallega Valley development. 
</P>
<P>
The company plans to build 5,000 homes, a business park and two golf courses on 
2,200 acres on Avenida Pico, northeast of the downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
City officials say the development is ideal for a corporate center. 
</P>
<P>
"We in San Clemente have a lot to offer," Holloway said. "We have a great 
environment, clean air, no traffic congestion, relatively cheap land and a 
great quality of life." 
</P>
<P>
Holloway said he plans to meet with Arvida officials to discuss the council's 
suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, the city hoped that the Rancho San Clemente business park 
would be a magnet for major corporations, but the site has attracted only small 
and mid-sized companies. 
</P>
<P>
Councilman Thomas Lorch suggested that the city maintain large parcels of land 
at Rancho San Clemente to attract businesses. 
</P>
<P>
But officials voted 4 to 1 against imposing a halt on additional subdivisions. 
</P>
<P>
"There are benefits for the company and the city," Holloway said. "Arvida can 
enhance the value of its property and we can expand our tax base." DAVAN

<P>
As the statewide drought entered its fifth year, its impact in the county 
spread from a few cities to virtually every farm and community. 
</P>
<P>
Ventura, which has perhaps the most severe shortage in the county, passed a 
mandatory conservation ordinance in May that required major institutions to 
reduce use by 20%, smaller businesses by 15%. Single-family residences were 
limited to 294 gallons a day and units in multifamily dwellings to 196 gallons. 
</P>
<P>
Compliance has been good, but the drought is still crippling the city. 
</P>
<P>
Some companies have threatened to leave. Ventura High School closed its leaking 
swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
Restrooms and showers at San Buenaventura State Beach have been shut off on 
weekdays. 
</P>
<P>
At one point, the city talked about towing in icebergs from polar regions. 
Enthusiasm for that idea quickly melted, but Ventura still is considering 
building a seawater desalination plant. In the fall, Ventura commissioned a 
study on the environmental impact of building an $85-million pipeline to hook 
into the state water system at Lake Castaic. But the state system is hurting, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
In December, the Metropolitan Water District, which imports water from the 
Colorado River and Northern California, imposed restrictions on its customers, 
including Simi Valley, Thousand Oaks, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit were farmers, who were ordered to reduce consumption by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Ahead 
</P>
<P>
In Ventura and the Ojai Valley, local rainfall will determine how soon the 
drought ends. 
</P>
<P>
In the eastern part of the county, the key factor is how much rain and snow 
falls in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
Without above-normal precipitation this winter, the state predicts that 
agriculture will be cut to 35% of normal supplies in 1991, while municipal and 
industrial customers get 85%. 
</P>
<P>
If growers have to plant less, they won't need to buy as much fuel or 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
Fewer jobs will be available for farm workers, perhaps resulting in an increase 
in welfare payments. 
</P>
<P>
Produce will cost more.

POLICE RESERVE UNIT CALLED TO ACTIVE DUTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
Members of the 440th Military Police detachment based in Irvine are scheduled 
to report for active duty at the Army Reserve Center at Los Alamitos on 
Thursday to receive equipment and fill out paperwork before leaving for 
training at Ft. Ord. 
</P>
<P>
The 10-member 440th, which specializes in detaining prisoners of war, consists 
mostly law enforcement officers who work for police departments in Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,000 reservists from California, Nevada and Arizona have been 
called to active duty from the 63rd Army Reserve Command headquarters at Los 
Alamitos since the Persian Gulf crisis erupted in early August. 
</P>
<P>
Ted Bartimus, a spokesman for the 63rd Army Reserve Command, said the small, 
Irvine-based unit was being called up "in support of Operation Desert Shield." 
But he would not speculate on whether the detachment would be shipped to the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
But Bartimus did say it would be about a week before the unit would leave the 
area for Ft. Ord in Northern California. GEORGE FRANK

O.C. YOUTH PAROLE PROGRAM TO CEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
The California Youth Authority's Volunteers in Parole program for Orange County 
ends the year primarily in boxes and crates, as its director, Patricia C. 
Ruhlman, prepares to close down the office. 
</P>
<P>
Volunteers in Parole, which matches attorneys with ex-youth offenders in a type 
of Big-Brother/Big-Sister program, opened an Orange County office in 1982, and 
since then has made 175 matches between lawyers and parolees. 
</P>
<P>
But state budget woes are forcing it to close. The state Volunteers in Parole 
program will keep an eye on Orange County from a new regional office in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
Ruhlman said the director there, James Pauley, will try to keep the current 25 
Orange County matches going. 
</P>
<P>
The state maintained three of its seven programs in the budget squeeze, but 
Orange County did not make the cutoff. 
</P>
<P>
"We've had some failures, but we've had some wonderful successes," Ruhlman 
said. "We have one youth who is now in law school. We've had several who have 
been able to start their own businesses. I still believe strongly that the 
concept is a good one." 
</P>
<P>
The idea was to help ex-offenders adjust to parole by matching them with 
someone who would show an interest in what happened to them. 
</P>
<P>
"We had some negative influences we had to deal with with, primarily gangs and 
the growing use of drugs," Ruhlman said. 
</P>
<P>
The program was co-sponsored by the California Bar Assn. and the Orange County 
Bar Assn. But the bulk of the money came from the Youth Authority, and the two 
bar groups did not have the funds to make up the difference when the state 
agency had to curtail its Orange County expenses. JERRY HICKS

<P>
On Feb. 13, cardiac patient Duane Johnson began throwing himself against the 
walls of his room at Ventura County Medical Center to protest plans to transfer 
him back to a mental health facility. 
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials summoned Ventura police officers, triggering an ongoing 
controversy about the use of stun guns by police. 
</P>
<P>
Stun guns jar the nervous system with 50,000 volts of electricity. Defenders 
say they are often the best way -- short of gunfire -- to deter misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
But as the Johnson case illustrates, they can be lethal. 
</P>
<P>
The two officers jolted Johnson seven to 11 times, according to a coroner's 
report, even after he was tethered to a hospital gurney. 
</P>
<P>
He died within minutes of the final application. 
</P>
<P>
The autopsy attributed death to the stun gun applications, as well as to 
Johnson's exertions and heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
A district attorney's investigator found that the officers had used 
"inappropriate and unjustified" force, but the agency declined to prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
Four months later, a Ventura officer used a stun gun nine times on a driver who 
refused to get out of his truck for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
It turned out that the 26-year-old man, Donn Christensen Jr., was coming out of 
an epileptic seizure and did not comprehend the officer's commands. 
</P>
<P>
Although the officer's immediate superiors recommended dismissal, Chief Richard 
F. Thomas decided instead to suspend the officer for a month. 
</P>
<P>
Thomas also revised the department's policy on stun guns, saying they should be 
used defensively, not to force suspects to comply with orders. 
</P>
<P>
Christensen sued the city and ended up accepting a $150,000 settlement. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
Looking Ahead 
</P>
<P>
Johnson's parents filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against the city and county in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
It did not specify an amount, but the family had filed claims of $2.5 million 
each against the city and county, which rejected them. 
</P>
<P>
It may be years before the case reaches trial.

<P>
A Garden Grove woman died early Sunday when she apparently lost control of the 
car she was driving and hit a traffic signal pole on Beach Boulevard, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The victim, Deanna Pennington, 21, of Garden Grove, was alone in her 1987 
Toyota Corolla, driving north at 3:05 a.m., according to Westminster police. 
</P>
<P>
Witnesses told police that Pennington was swerving in the slow lane as she 
approached Trask Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
"The car jumped the curb at the intersection," Westminster Police Sgt. Russell 
Silva said. "Then she (crashed) into the signal pole." 
</P>
<P>
Damage to the car was extensive, and Pennington, who was not wearing a seat 
belt, had to be pried from the vehicle with a hydraulic device, Silva said. 
</P>
<P>
Pennington suffered head injuries and died at the scene. There were no other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
An investigation is continuing, Silva said. JIM NEWTON

FATAL ATTACK, OTHERS ASSUMED CONNECTED

Detectives investigating the death of a restaurant worker beaten as he walked 
home Saturday morning say they continue to assume that he was a victim of men 
wielding baseball bats who may have attacked three others in Orange and Santa 
Ana in less than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
"We're just assuming these could be related. 
</P>
<P>
We don't have a witness or statements from the victim, but the similarities are 
obvious," said Sgt. Jim Peery. 
</P>
<P>
The victim of the first attack, which occurred at 11:45 p.m. Friday, was 
identified as Alfredo Ernesto Rojas, 24, of Santa Ana. Rojas was walking with a 
friend in the 200 block of East 17th Street when three men in a red, two-door 
Chevrolet drove up and one got out, struck Rojas on the head with a bat and 
stole his money, police said. Rojas described the men as black but a witness 
described them as Latino. 
</P>
<P>
Little more than an hour later, a 29-year-old man riding a bicycle on North 
Tustin Street in Orange was struck with a baseball bat, kicked, beaten and 
robbed. He could not describe the attackers or their numbers. His name was 
withheld. 
</P>
<P>
About 1:20 a.m. Saturday, Froylan Velasquez, 26, was found severely beaten near 
the gate of his Tustin apartment complex and died later that morning. Police 
said they have found no witnesses to the attack. 
</P>
<P>
And at about 1:30 a.m. Rene Jimenez, 24, of Santa Ana was riding his bicycle in 
the 800 block of North Bristol Street in Santa Ana when he was pulled off and 
struck by baseball bats. He described his attackers as two black men. STEVE

CLERKS AT 13 STORES ARRESTED AFTER MINORS BUY ALCOHOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Using 19-year-old cadets in an undercover operation, Ventura County sheriff's 
deputies arrested clerks at 13 stores in Moorpark and Thousand Oaks on 
suspicion of selling alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
Friday's undercover operation, which encompassed 70 stores and restaurants that 
sell alcoholic beverages, was part of an ongoing effort by police to curb the 
consumption of liquor by minors, according to a Sheriff's Department statement. 
</P>
<P>
"We do it every year about this time," said Sgt. Frank O'Hanlon of the 
Sheriff's Department's eastern division. 
</P>
<P>
O'Hanlon said the department's cadets are part-time employees who are in 
college or below the age required to be a full-fledged deputy sheriff. He said 
many of the cited clerks were also under the legal drinking age of 21. "I'm 
sure that the average age of a store clerk was around 18 years old," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Typically, he said, the underage cadets will select a six-pack of beer in a 
store or order a drink at a restaurant and see if they are allowed to buy it. 
If the clerk or waiter approves the purchase, a deputy sheriff steps in after 
watching the transaction, seizes the alcohol and issues a citation. 
</P>
<P>
The Sheriff's Department also forwards the names of the businesses to the state 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control for possible administrative sanctions. 
The state agency has the power to suspend or revoke liquor licenses.

<P>
While transportation picks up steam, environmentalists hope to maintain 
momentum gained from 1990, the year of the environment. 
</P>
<P>
Progress will be made in the continuing effort to clean up the county's 
polluted but valuable ground-water basin. The Orange County Water District will 
open five state-of-the-art treatment plants in 1991 to remove chemicals from 
the water basin and produce about 8 million gallons a day of drinkable water. 
Most of the contamination came from old agricultural runoff or industrial 
solvent spills. 
</P>
<P>
The year should also bring long-awaited regulations that would require sewage 
plants and dairy farms that discharge into the Santa Ana River to build 
treatment plants. The river is a main source of the county's ground water. 
</P>
<P>
Any business leaders who are dumping toxic waste illegally may find 1991 a good 
year to straighten up. The district attorney's office is mounting a crackdown 
on the crime, which has been increasing because of the cost and difficulty that 
Southern California companies face when disposing of waste legally. 
</P>
<P>
About a dozen more Orange County cities will jump on the recycling bandwagon 
next year and implement programs that encourage residents to sort their 
bottles, papers and cans. 
</P>
<P>
"Residential recycling of some sort will be going on in almost every city next 
year," said Jan Goss, Orange County's recycling manager. "A lot of cities have 
programs in planning stages now and will be implementing them soon." 
</P>
<P>
Local conservationists anticipate some fierce battles in 1991 as they try to 
protect the oak groves, coastal sage scrub and other rapidly vanishing wildlife 
habitats in Gypsum Canyon, Coal Canyon and the southeastern canyons of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
They promise to fight some new developments more vocally and actively than 
ever, saying they will resort to lawsuits if necessary.

"Orange County's not a lost cause yet," said Esther Burkett, the state 
Department of Fish and Game's wildlife biologist for Orange County. "But we 
have to slow down (development) right now. If we pursue this pace for the next 
10 years, then it is a lost cause." MARLA CONE

LOWER EDUCATION: O.C.'S IMPACT ON STATE ISSUES

<P>
Look for Orange County to be at the forefront of state education issues -- 
particularly funding matters -- in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
Without a doubt, the greatest impact on county and state education issues will 
come from the appointment of Maureen DiMarco, president of the Garden Grove 
Unified School District Board of Trustees, as Gov.-elect Pete Wilson's 
"education czar." 
</P>
<P>
As secretary for child development and education, DiMarco will be charged with 
establishing a cohesive policy on education and youth issues. While DiMarco 
will have to give equal weight to concerns from throughout the state, her 
presence in Sacramento will likely give her Orange County colleagues a 
much-needed sympathetic ear in the Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
And DiMarco is likely to find herself surrounded by those colleagues. Among 
them could be members of a steering committee headed by J. Kenneth Jones, 
superintendent of the Fullerton Joint Union High School District, who is 
leading the fight for repeal of a law that allows counties to assess fees for 
collecting property taxes from cities and school districts. 
</P>
<P>
While the steering committee lobbies in Sacramento, the Capistrano Unified 
School District will be waging another battle in the courts. Last month, the 
district announced that it will lead eight other districts in the state in a 
lawsuit against state schools chief Bill Honig, who Capistrano officials charge 
has failed to enforce the Serrano-Priest law requiring equal funding among all 
school districts. 
</P>
<P>
While much of the focus in 1991 will be on Orange County's impact on state 
issues, the face of county education will change as well. For the first time in 
more than two decades, the county will have a new schools chief -- John F. 
Dean, who takes over from longtime Supt. Robert Peterson on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
In addition to the seemingly never-ending problem of funding, Dean and other 
educators will be faced with other ongoing problems such as the lack of 
bilingual teachers in an increasingly multilingual county and restructuring 
curricula for students who are not bound for college. 
</P>
<P>
Orange County will be at the forefront of a nationwide effort to solve the 
latter issue with the involvement of four school districts in a joint 
schools-business partnership led by the American Business Conference, an 
organization of 100 chief executive officers of mid-size companies. The 
program, which aims to channel high school graduates directly into the work 
force, will be tried on an experimental basis in Orange County, New Jersey and 
Texas, starting in 1991. TONY MARCANO

HIS ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT POINTED TO SUCCESS; 
</P>
<P>
RETAIL: LARRY IMPERIALE, 1986 WINNER OF SAN DIEGO STATE'S BUSINESS PLAN 
COMPETITION, SAW A NICHE AMONG THE POINT-OF-SALE GIANTS AND FILLED IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Not all winners of the annual San Diego State University business plan 
competition go on to start a business, much less become successful. 
</P>
<P>
But Larry Imperiale did and is. 
</P>
<P>
His company, SalePoint, has become a leading producer of point-of-sale systems 
used by specialty retailers to track sales and inventory and to improve store 
operations. SalePoint expects to do more than $4 million in sales in 1990, only 
its third full year in business. SalePoint systems, which basically are cash 
registers linked to personal computers, consist of SalePoint-designed software 
and International Business Machines hardware. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale's company has thrived despite heavy competition from corporate giants 
such as NCR, Fujitsu and IBM. Among SalePoint's successes are agreements to 
supply systems to retailers such as Williams-Sonoma, The Nature Company, 
Egghead Software and Universal Studios in California and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale, 32, attributes his success in large part to the annual SDSU business 
plan competition, which he won in 1986 shortly before receiving his master's 
degree in business administration. The young entrepreneur said the competition 
forced him to focus and concentrate his ideas in coming up with what became the 
blueprint for starting SalePoint in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
Business plans are documents that entrepreneurs use to lay the groundwork for a 
new enterprise. The documents, which contain an array of market, technical and 
financial information, also serve as marketing tools used to attract capital 
from investors or lenders. 
</P>
<P>
Each year, SDSU sponsors a competition to encourage business students to come 
to grips with the hard realities of starting up a new business and to foster 
the entrepreneurial spirit. The competition is held every December and is 
judged by an outside panel, including San Diego business executives, bankers, 
venture capitalists and journalists. 
</P>
<P>
For Imperiale, a Redwood City native who attended SDSU's graduate business 
school while holding down a full-time job at Triad Systems, his contest entry 
became "the vehicle for taking my idea and putting brackets around it." 
</P>
<P>
"The plan was a way of saying, here's how to go about doing it, forcing me to 
write it down, plan it out and anticipate all the obstacles I'd run into," 
Imperiale said. "Academically, (the contest) let me tie in everything I learned 
through my business school program through one exercise. That's what's lacking 
in most business schools. There is so much theoretical stuff that you lose 
touch with the pragmatic." 
</P>
<P>
The thesis of Imperiale's plan was that there was an opportunity in the retail 
point-of-sale market to develop a system suited to specialty retail stores. 
Imperiale knew what he was talking about: he was working in point-of-sale 
products for Triad Systems. 
</P>
<P>
At the time he wrote his plan, most of the advanced point-of-sale systems 
offered by IBM, NCR and others were targeting very large operations such as 
department stores that were likely to have 100 or more cash registers per 
location. 
</P>
<P>
Smaller stores and chains were being neglected, Imperiale said, because it was 
easier for the manufacturers to sell and service the larger accounts. And not 
many small businesses could afford the cost of the IBM and NCR systems, which 
made economic sense only if the cost could be spread out among dozens of 
"points of sale," or cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
After Triad declined to take up his idea, Imperiale resigned and started out on 
his own. He soon took on as his partner Alan Grant, a retired San Jose venture 
capitalist living in Coronado and a former national director of the American 
Electronics Assn. Grant helped Imperiale navigate the rough financial waters 
that all start-up companies encounter. 
</P>
<P>
Imperiale's company set out to develop a product geared to retailers with less 
than 10 cash registers per store, and costing half what IBM was charging per 
register. SalePoint's system would also use operating software that permitted 
store managers to use the computers for a variety of purposes. A drawback of 
IBM's proprietary software used in its large-store systems was that it was good 
only for the point-of-sale system, Imperiale said. 
</P>
<P>
The product SalePoint introduced in 1988 was good enough that IBM accepted the 
company as an "industry remarketer" of its products, a tacit admission that 
SalePoint could serve a computer market that Big Blue couldn't, IBM's Beverly 
de Luise said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
"IBM depends on its industry remarketers to help us get into niches that IBM 
does not have solutions for," said De Luise, a Raleigh, N.C.-based marketing 
representative who has responsibility for store systems products. "Theme parks 
are a good example. SalePoint has sold IBM hardware into Universal Studios. We 
use them as marketing arms and legs for us." 
</P>
<P>
Despite contractual terms that prohibit SalePoint from selling its software 
with other brands of point-of-sale hardware, Imperiale said his relationship 
with IBM has worked well. The main advantage has been the sales leads that it 
receives from IBM salespeople, who receive the same commissions from a 
SalePoint deal that they would from selling the systems themselves. 
</P>
<P>
The industry term industry remarketer has come to replace value-added reseller, 
or VAR, as a description for a company that buys computer hardware, then adds 
its own software, hardware or technical expertise before reselling the package 
to the end user, Imperiale said. There are an estimated 8,000 such companies in 
the country, according to International Data Corp., a market research firm 
based in Framingham, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
SalePoint's five-year, $5-million deal signed last June to supply point-of-sale 
systems to Williams-Sonoma, a San Francisco-based retailer of specialty 
cookware items, was "a real feather in their cap," said Thomas H. Friedman, 
publisher of Retail Systems Alert, a Newton, Mass.-based industry newsletter 
that reports on retail automation trends. 
</P>
<P>
"There are companies that are bigger than SalePoint, wealthier than SalePoint, 
with more technical resources than SalePoint, but there are few companies with 
the tenacity of SalePoint," Friedman said.

ANN CONWAY: CHINESE-AMERICAN DEBUTANTE BALL WINS ATTENTION FROM TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Talk about hitting the social jackpot. Not only did Saturday's Winter Blossom 
Ball make the big time -- it marked the country's first ever Chinese-American 
debutante ball -- it made prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Boyd Matson, correspondent for NBC's "Real Life With Jane Pauley" television 
show, was on hand, interviewing and overseeing the filming of the debs as they 
made their formal bow to society in the Grand Ballroom of the Disneyland Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
The tall and suave Matson, an NBC correspondent since 1974, flew in from New 
York with producer Betsy Kavetas on Friday so they could rise early on Saturday 
to shoot the debs as they were made up, had portraits taken, rehearsed and 
stole their parents' breath away when -- in flowing white gowns -- they swept 
through an archway smothered with flowers and twinkle lights. 
</P>
<P>
Kavetas got the idea for what is to become the deb documentary after seeing a 
September article about the upcoming ball in the View section of The Times: 
More than 20 Chinese-American women were going to make their debuts to benefit 
the Asian American Senior Citizens Service Center in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
"I was visiting a girlfriend in Malibu -- that's how I happened to see it," 
said Kavetas, one of 10 field producers for the television show. "When I got 
back, I told Jane about it and she loved the idea. We'd been looking to do a 
story on debs, but this was going to be much more interesting than doing one in 
New York or Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
The event would be delightfully ironic, thought Matson, who occasionally shares 
the interview spotlight with Pauley. 
</P>
<P>
"The debs' parents are very proud of the fact that they've come to America and 
made it," Matson said. "So they've taken on a Western tradition to push 
something they want . . . (their daughters) to meet some nice Asian boys." And, 
Matson added, "The philanthropic approach gives their community the chance to 
take care of its elders, a Chinese tradition they're afraid they'll lose by 
becoming Americanized." 
</P>
<P>
Debutante Carolyn Mar of Irvine agreed that the ball was about more than the 
chance to meet Chinese-American boys (all of the debs' escorts were 
Chinese-American). It was about borrowing an American tradition to instill 
Chinese values. 
</P>
<P>
"That's what this whole thing is really for," said Mar, 20, a Brown University 
senior, who made her debut with her sister Christine Mar, 17. 
</P>
<P>
"On one hand, " she said, "it might be seen only as an assimilation of American 
culture. But, we're really doing something very Asian, taking care of the 
elderly -- putting them first. It's a unique collision of two cultures and the 
ball puts them together in a very beautiful light." 
</P>
<P>
Christine Mar listened carefully as her older sister spoke. "How eloquent," she 
said in a teasing tone. "Seriously," she added with a giggle, "what Carolyn 
said is true." 
</P>
<P>
Were the sisters nervous about making their debuts in front of 400 guests and 
rolling TV cameras? "Not really," said Christine, a senior at University High 
School. "All my friends are going to be up there with me." 
</P>
<P>
"Well, it's pretty exciting," conceded Carolyn, an English major. "I had no 
idea it was going to be such a media event." 
</P>
<P>
Festivities began at 6 p.m. with a cocktail reception and silent auction, which 
included artworks by March Fong Eu, California secretary of state. After their 
presentation, the debutantes joined their families for a sit-down dinner of 
sorrel bisque en croute, filet of beef Bordelaise and a potato basket brimming 
with shrimp and scallops. 
</P>
<P>
Daniel Shen, founding chairman of the Asian American Senior Citizens Service 
Center, welcomed guests, who sat at tables with mirrored pedestal vases 
containing daisies, carnations and tuber roses. 
</P>
<P>
"About a year ago," Shen announced, "a group of us thought how wonderful it 
could be to do something for the Asian senior citizens of Orange County. The 
need for a facility was obvious. Tonight, we raise funds for a dream. A dream 
we can make true for our senior citizens." 
</P>
<P>
Also making their debuts were Grace Chang, Pei-Lin Chen, Stacie Cheng, Rosalie 
Chin, Tammy Chin, Alice Hsu, Corinna Kao, Sansan Kwan, Annie Lai, Cindy Lee, 
Gigi Lee, Joni Lee, Kristine Lee, Lily Lee, Marian Lee, Michelle Li, Emily Liu, 
Christine Sun and Bernice Wu. 
</P>
<P>
Among special guests were ball chairwoman Ruth Ding (who estimated proceeds 
from the $100-per-person event at about $100,000); ball co-chairwomen Mary Hsu 
and Sarah Mar; Nelson Mar, president of the senior center; Thomas Yuen of AST 
Research Inc.; John Chang of British Petroleum Chemicals Inc.; 1984 Olympic 
Team figure skater Tiffany Chin; Michael Chang, winner of the 1989 French Open 
tennis tourney; March Fong Eu and her son, Matt Fong, and Beaulah Ku, executive 
director of the Assn. of Asian Pacific American Artists.

President Bush plans to spend a quiet New Year's Eve with his wife, his 
daughter and two of his grandchildren at Camp David, the White House said 
today. 
</P>
<P>
The Bushes have not invited any outsiders to ring in 1991 at the presidential 
retreat in the Cacoctin Mountains of Maryland about 60 miles from here, aides 
said. 
</P>
<P>
The President went to Camp David before Christmas. He has remained there 
throughout the holidays, coming back to Washington only for one day to handle 
paperwork. Bush plans to return to the White House on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
Aides said they had no idea whether Bush will stay up until midnight. 
</P>
<P>
Bush's low-key New Year's Eve is a sharp contrast from the parties that former 
President Ronald Reagan annually attended in Palm Springs, Calif. The 
celebrity-studded events were hosted by publisher Walter H. Annenberg.

SOMALI REBELS CLAIM HOLD ON CAPITAL CITY

<P>
Rebels in Somalia said today they control most of the capital of Mogadishu and 
President Mohamed Siad Barre was at the airport preparing to flee the country. 
</P>
<P>
"I think he will be gone in the next 24 hours," said a spokesman for the United 
Somali Congress, one of the main rebel groups fighting to overthrow Maj. Gen. 
Siad Barre, who has been in power since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
"We now control 99% of Mogadishu," the congress spokesman, contacted in Rome by 
telephone from Nairobi, told Reuters. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the United Somali Congress began taking control of 
Mogadishu on Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
"From yesterday evening many of the army people had retreated to their camps, 
and there is fighting going on around the camps, mainly in the south of the 
city," the spokesman said, adding there was also fighting around the 
president's palace and the airport. 
</P>
<P>
He said Siad Barre had left the presidential palace early today. 
</P>
<P>
"We don't know which country he will go to but he is certainly preparing to 
leave," the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said as soon as Siad Barre has left, the congress plans to call 
in other rebel groups and political opposition organizations to cooperate on 
forming a transitional government. 
</P>
<P>
Residents in Mogadishu said fighting, especially heavy Saturday night, 
continued today in many parts of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
There has been an upsurge of violence in recent weeks in the capital. The 
United Somali Congress and another major rebel group, the Somali National 
Movement, said in August they would cooperate on trying to overthrow Siad 
Barre. 
</P>
<P>
The rebels rejected as mere cosmetics his recent efforts to liberalize 
one-party rule -- in force since he came to power in a coup -- and to call in 
opposition groups for peace talks.

Fifty-six people were killed when a passenger bus traveling at high speed 
collided with a truck and caught fire in southern Russia, police said today. 
</P>
<P>
A traffic police spokesman said the accident occurred Sunday morning on the 
highway linking Rostov-on-Don and Voronezh. 
</P>
<P>
He gave no further details but said a senior police inspector had been sent to 
the site. 
</P>
<P>
The independent Postfactum news agency said the accident occurred when a car 
crossed the dividing line and collided with the truck. The bus then plowed into 
the two vehicles at high speed. 
</P>
<P>
"According to the representative of the transport company, the bus was 
completely burned out," Postfactum said. "Fifty-five passengers died on the 
spot. Thirteen people were taken to a hospital in the city of 
Alekseyevo-Lozovoskoye, where one passenger died."

A 14-year-old girl sitting alone on a suburban porch was killed in a drive-by

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli planes bombed a PLO guerrilla base near Sidon early today, killing all 
12 of the fighters manning it, police and the PLO said. It was the highest 
death toll in 21 such attacks this year. 
</P>
<P>
The police report said the jets destroyed a one-story base belonging to Yasser 
Arafat's Fatah, the Palestine Liberation Organization's largest faction. 
</P>
<P>
The base was in a lemon grove 7 1/2 miles southeast of Sidon, a southern port 
city that is the Palestinians' main stronghold in Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, the Israeli military command said its planes returned safely to 
base after hitting "a launching pad for attacks on Israel." 
</P>
<P>
The air raid came a day after Soviet-designed Katyusha rockets landed in 
Israel's self-designated security zone and across the border in northern 
Israel. The rockets caused no damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
Police and the PLO confirmed in separate statements that all the guerrillas 
were killed. 
</P>
<P>
"There were no survivors. Those dug out alive died in ambulances before 
reaching hospital," a police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
Police said 28 people were killed and 82 wounded in the 20 previous Israel 
raids into Lebanon this year. 
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem today, a bomb ripped through a toilet at an outdoor market in the 
heart of the Jewish quarter, killing an Arab woman who apparently was handling 
the explosives, police said. 
</P>
<P>
They said the victim was a 24-year-old woman from the occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
"Apparently the person who was handling the charge was killed in this toilet 
stall," said police Commissioner Yaacov Terner. She was alone in the toilet, 
and there were no other casualties, he said. 
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at about 11:30 a.m. at the Mahane Yehuda market. Terner 
said the woman was "torn to pieces," but a witness said she was still alive 
immediately after the blast. 
</P>
<P>
Shopkeeper Meir Cohen said he ran into the toilet and found the woman lying 
under a fallen door. "She was alive, the woman. I lifted her head. She moved 
her head as if she wanted to speak, wanted help," he said. 
</P>
<P>
Cohen said she had something in her hand that he feared might be another bomb, 
so he ran to nearby police to summon help. 
</P>
<P>
A PLO military communique issued in Tunis claimed the Israeli air strike was 
part of a "massive military operation" Israel was planning in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
It said Israel pushed troop reinforcements "estimated at two brigades" into its 
self-designated security zone in southern Lebanon three days ago, but gave no 
other details. 
</P>
<P>
The reported buildup could not be independently confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
Fatah, the largest and oldest of nine groups under the PLO, marks the 26th 
anniversary of its foundation Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
In the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the army today confined 1 million Arab's to 
their homes ahead of the Fatah anniversary. Authorities closed schools in the 
territories.

Surprised Greek officials struggled to put up hundreds of newly arrived 
Albanian refugees in makeshift shelters today, and Albanian Jews were arriving 
in Israel under relaxed travel restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
Hundreds more Albanians trekked across frozen mountains and rivers today in the 
biggest exodus from their country since its Communist government promised 
reforms last summer. 
</P>
<P>
Military sources in the northwestern Greek border town of Filiates said today 
that 632 Albanians, most of them ethnic Greeks, had crossed the frontier since 
daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, at least 500 Albanians arrived in northern Greece seeking political 
asylum. In addition, 37 Jews flew to Rome from the Albanian capital of Tirana 
en route to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
So far this month, more than 1,600 people from the tiny Balkan nation of 3.3 
million have fled into Greece across the once tightly sealed 100-mile frontier.

Culture Minister Andrei Plesu said today that he is resigning over the 
government's decision to expel ex-King Michael last week. 
</P>
<P>
Plesu told Bucharest radio he had tendered his resignation to Premier Petre 
Roman to protest what he called a "communication crisis within the government." 
</P>
<P>
Plesu, who was unavailable for comment, said his resignation was not 
politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
"I was faced with a situation in which the government has taken decisions and 
issued communiques without consulting all its members," Plesu said in the 
broadcast. 
</P>
<P>
Plesu said that Roman has not accepted his resignation and that it will be 
discussed at the next Cabinet meeting. 
</P>
<P>
On Christmas Day the 69-year-old former monarch arrived in his native land 
after 43 years of exile but was expelled less than 12 hours later by the 
Romanian authorities who said he did not have an entry visa.

President Mikhail S. Gorbachev admitted today that serious errors had been 
committed under his leadership but predicted that the Soviet people would see a 
turning point in their fortunes in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
Gorbachev, in a New Year message broadcast just before midnight, described 1990 
as "an exceptionally difficult year." 
</P>
<P>
He said economic problems were inevitable in a vast country embarking on a 
transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
"To this were added shortcomings and errors of even recent times -- errors by 
the country's leadership, our common inadequacies," he said. 
</P>
<P>
He demanded a commitment to hard work and discipline to halt a decline in 
living standards. "However deep the crisis endured by our country, we can and 
must achieve a turning point for the better . . . in the coming year," 
Gorbachev said.

British Airways PLC, KLM Royal Dutch Airways and Belgium's Sabena World Airways 
announced today they are scrapping their plans jointly to form a regional 
airline with a hub in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
The three carriers in a joint news release cited "practical difficulties 
involved in implementing the original objectives." 
</P>
<P>
A KLM spokesman acknowledged that uncertainty over obtaining European Community 
regulatory approval was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
The three airlines had intended to develop their venture into a regional 
European airline, using Brussels' Zaventem airport as the center of a 
hub-and-spoke route network linking 75 cities throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
British Airways specified in its own news release that "Sabena SA has made it 
clear that the group requires recapitalization and reorganization of a kind 
which the present minority investments agreed by British Airways and KLM could 
not solve."

A presidential commission planning the 500th anniversary celebration of 
Columbus' voyage to America has been plagued by problems: a tiny budget, few 
corporate donations and, until this month, almost no publicity. 
</P>
<P>
Now add a conflict-of-interest controversy to its list of woes. 
</P>
<P>
The panel's chairman, Miami real estate developer John Goudie, resigned amid 
disclosures that a close friend has ties to a company doing business with the 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
The event's biggest corporate sponsor, Texaco Inc., suspended its donations in 
September after raising questions about the commission's management. Another 
potential sponsor, Chrysler Corp., may stay away from the event. 
</P>
<P>
And a congressional subcommittee is looking into Goudie's involvement with the 
Christopher Columbus Licensing Group Inc., or CCLG, of Miami and New York. 
</P>
<P>
"To have this project blow up in our faces now is making it difficult to deal 
with future sponsors," said Frederick Guardabassi, a Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., 
businessman who has served on the commission since 1985. "So much damage has 
been done to the commission. It's a tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
The centerpieces of the celebration are replicas of Columbus' three ships being 
built in Spain and originally financed with money from Texaco. The commission 
is $600,000 in arrears in payments for the ships, which are to follow Columbus' 
route and visit 50 U.S. ports. 
</P>
<P>
Chrysler says it wants to clear up unspecified contractual questions before 
making a donation of more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
Congress has appropriated $210,000 a year for the commission, which pays for 
staff salaries and office space. 
</P>
<P>
Strapped for cash, the commission turned to CCLG in 1989 because the company 
was willing to pay $300,000 immediately for the licensing rights to Columbus 
souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
The rights potentially are worth millions. 
</P>
<P>
Goudie is a popular fund-raiser for Republican candidates in Florida. His 
Hispanic background made him a natural for the commission chairmanship, say GOP 
figures in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
This year, CCLG paid at least $35,000 to Manuel Gonzalez, who describes Goudie 
as a close friend. The two Miami businessmen have known each other since their 
days in junior college, Gonzalez said during the course of several interviews. 
</P>
<P>
Other commissioners said they didn't know about Gonzalez' role. 
</P>
<P>
"I was stunned," said Commissioner Charles Ginoli, who served on the finance 
committee that reviewed the CCLG contract.

Like a patrolman on the beat, Lee Barrett strides into a Chinese restaurant, 
flashes his ID card and has a look around. "StyroCop" is on the trail of 
illicit carryout containers. 
</P>
<P>
The city has gotten a complaint that the restaurant is putting its egg rolls 
and fried rice in boxes that violate Portland's year-old ban on polystyrene 
foam fast-food containers. 
</P>
<P>
Barrett, 44, a longtime environmental activist, is the ban's enforcer. A local 
television reporter dubbed him StyroCop -- a takeoff on the movie "RoboCop" -- 
his first day on the job, and he's become something of a celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
The Portland law does not restrict containers made of paper or plastic not 
blown into foam. Those have been the alternatives used by fast-food 
restaurants, the only industry affected by the Portland law. 
</P>
<P>
Businesses cited by Barrett face fines of $250 for a first offense and $500 for 
each subsequent offense. 
</P>
<P>
Neither a police officer nor a health inspector, Barrett only responds to 
complaints received by the city. He's written only a handful of tickets but 
says the law is a start and has raised public awareness. 
</P>
<P>
Back at the Chinese restaurant, Barrett spots a stack of carryout containers in 
the kitchen and holds one up. 
</P>
<P>
"That's a hundred percent polystyrene," he said. "Zero percent air." It's 
legal. Barrett asks to see a storeroom downstairs, where he finds more of the 
same.

Troy Bowe's free throw with 1:28 to play snapped an 82-82 tie as Hawaii stunned 
No. 11 Pittsburgh, 84-82, Sunday to win the Rainbow Classic for the first time 
in 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
Bowe hit another free throw with six seconds left to close out the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
Pittsburgh's Brian Shorter tried to get off a 15-foot jumper as time expired, 
but Tim Shepherd stripped the ball from him. 
</P>
<P>
Ray Reed scored 24 of his 35 points in the second half to lead Hawaii (8-3). 
</P>
<P>
It's the first Rainbow Classic title for Hawaii since they beat Purdue in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
Asked if the win was his biggest since taking over as Hawaii coach in 1987, 
Riley Wallace responded: "How about life? Beating Pitt, ranked 11th in the 
country, nothing compares to this." 
</P>
<P>
Pitt Coach Paul Evans was angry with the officials, who called 27 fouls on his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
Evans, however, admitted that Reed and his team's 17 turnovers played more a 
factor in the outcome than the officiating did. 
</P>
<P>
"Reed was tough to stop, and when we did they got the offensive rebounds," 
Evans said. "Turnovers also hurt us. It will be interesting to see how we react 
after this loss." 
</P>
<P>
Reed scored seven points during a 9-0 Hawaii run that erased a 54-49 Pittsburgh 
lead.

States clinched the match with a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
"I think it was tough for both Zina and me, because we hadn't played for a 
while," Wheaton said. "I certainly felt a little out of it." 
</P>
<P>
Garrison was returning to tennis after a monthlong vacation. "I'm only just 
getting back into the flow of tennis after not playing since the Virginia Slims 
championship a month ago," she said.

Shriver, once the third-ranked player in the world and the winner of 21 Grand

MELVIN DURSLAG: A CRAZY EIGHT IS TOO MUCH FOR ONE TV SCREEN; 
</P>
<P>
COLLEGE FOOTBALL: THE OVERABUNDANCE OF BOWL GAMES ON NEW YEAR'S DAY MAKES IT 
IMPOSSIBLE TO WATCH THEM ALL. WHO CAME UP WITH THIS SYSTEM? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
Inspecting the bowl football program on New Year's Day, you have a vision of 
herring in a net, flopping over one another. 
</P>
<P>
The current lineup embraces eight games, running from 8:30 in the morning (PST) 
until roughly 8:30 at night. 
</P>
<P>
You are surprised the genii of college football have stopped at eight games. 
Between midnight and 8 a.m., they could book two more. 
</P>
<P>
And, of course, they could squeeze in another in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
Right now, they have arranged so many games Jan. 1 that an overlap occurs. For 
instance, the Citrus Bowl, the Cotton Bowl and the Hall of Fame Bowl poach on 
each other's telecast. 
</P>
<P>
And all three arrive on the air at some time during the second half of the 
Gator Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
The Orange Bowl and the Sugar Bowl overlap, same as the Fiesta Bowl and the 
Rose Bowl. And all are coming off a previous day of activity featuring the John 
Hancock Bowl and the Domino's Pizza Copper Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
A confused viewer of those two could leave his set believing he will be insured 
in 30 minutes, or the policy is free. 
</P>
<P>
You are a tolerant individual. You are patient and understanding, the milk of 
human kindness flowing by the liter through every vein. 
</P>
<P>
You are not aiming to rock the vessel. All you are trying to comprehend is 
whether college football has gone foaming-at-the-mouth mad. 
</P>
<P>
One isn't supposed to be dealing here with dummies. This is our highest 
intellectual order, the teachers of our young. 
</P>
<P>
And they allow a circumstance on New Year's Day calling for eight televised 
bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
If smart guys permit this excess, what would imbeciles do? 
</P>
<P>
So what has all this done to that spectacle billing itself as "the Granddaddy 
of 'Em All," the Rose Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
What it has done is reduce the Rose Bowl to selling nothing but age -- a game 
beginning in 1902 and continuing to the present, with intermittent stoppages. 
</P>
<P>
After the 1902 game, for instance, it stopped until 1916, substituting that 
well-known ghetto sport, polo. It also tried chariot races. 
</P>
<P>
And then the Rose Bowl ground to a halt in Pasadena in 1942 when the game was 
shifted to Durham, N.C. It was a war year, and Pasadena feared an air attack by 
the Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
What an insult to the Luftwaffe to OK the game on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
Although it was once the premier postseason game, the Rose Bowl has suffered 
serious slippage, not at the box office, but in the television ratings and in 
general prestige. 
</P>
<P>
And the ultimate contempt has been the willingness of other bowls to go 
head-and-head with it on TV. 
</P>
<P>
Offering Washington and Iowa this time, the Rose Bowl needn't necessarily 
apologize. Washington, on a good day, can knock off any amateur team in the 
hemisphere. 
</P>
<P>
And Iowa is better than average. 
</P>
<P>
But it has become increasingly rare that connoisseurs about the land judge the 
Rose Bowl as an event of major national impact. It is more a parochial little 
war between the Pacific 10 and the Big Ten, pretty much like Eton and Harrow. 
</P>
<P>
Since the Rose Bowl still dredges more money from television than any other 
bowl game -- that could be a fleeting condition -- it behooves the promoters 
each year to capture participants of muscle, teams with substantial followings. 
</P>
<P>
Those teams preferred are USC, UCLA, Michigan and Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
Washington and Iowa are rated fair. What ABC lives in fear of is, say, Oregon 
State vs. Indiana. 
</P>
<P>
Bucking seven other games New Year's Day, with such a matchup the network 
starts looking for a bridge. 
</P>
<P>
One is available in Pasadena, making the Rose Bowl a game of convenience, if 
nothing else.

Vocalist Bobby McFerrin lined up hundreds of people to hum and sing through a 
24-hour event billed as "Singing for Your Life." 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, whose songs include "Don't Worry, Be Happy," kicked things off Sunday 
night at Grace Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, winner of nine Grammy Awards, lined up about 300 singers, including 
members of his all-vocal ensemble, "Voicestra," to participate for several 
hours each, said Lauren Artress, canon pastor at the Episcopalian cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
McFerrin, who lives in San Francisco, said he hoped to show how music could 
help people deal with everyday problems. 
</P>
<P>
"I've become very fascinated with religious and spiritual significance of music 
in Third World countries, where everything is celebrated and honored," he said.

LIZ SMITH: RULING IN BUCHWALD SUIT SHAKES STUDIO SYSTEM TO ROOTS

IN THE SUMMER of 1989, this column wrote that the columnist Art Buchwald was 
going to sue Paramount for a share of profits from the Eddie Murphy hit "Coming 
to America." As you know, Buchwald did, and recently Judge Harvey Schneider 
ruled in Los Angeles that Paramount must pay Art and Alain Bernheim damages. 
(This ruling shook the studio system to its dark roots and threatens a real 
upheaval in Hollywood.) 
</P>
<P>
Buchwald tells me that there will no doubt be appeals and more appeals after 
the amount of money has been fixed. ("Coming to America" earned more than $300 
million, based on a treatment Buchwald and Bernheim sold to Paramount.) "My 
fear is that my grandchildren will see the money -- not me!" says Art. Added 
the funny man: "The part I like best about the entire thing is that Paramount's 
lawyers, from the beginning, have kept calling me a 'crybaby!' They said I 
signed a contract and then cried after I didn't like the terms. Now they are 
the ones who are crying the hardest. The Hollywood trade papers even announced 
that Paramount had canceled its Christmas party this year because of the 
judge's decision. Now that is carrying things too far. I am very upset if they 
canceled Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
THE OFFBEAT Gary Oldman has portrayed some unusual, creative real-life souls -- 
rocker Sid Vicious in the movie "Sid and Nancy" and the self-destructive gay 
playwright Joe Orton in "Prick Up Your Ears." Now this hugely talented Briton 
plans to assay another literary genius on the downhill slide. He will portray 
the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in a film to be directed by David Drury. This 
movie, which begins filming in January, co-stars Mrs. Gary Oldman -- actress 
Uma Thurman. She'll be Caitlin Thomas, the wife of Dylan. Shooting takes place 
both in New York City, where Thomas died of drink and poor medical attention 
back in 1953, and in his hometown of Laugharne.

Tammy Wynette says a new generation of performers has helped popularize country 
music all over again. 
</P>
<P>
"The abundance of great new talent . . . is changing the demographics of the 
listening and buying audience," she said in comments published in the Country 
Music Assn.'s "Close-Up" magazine. 
</P>
<P>
"Because of their impact, the audiences are younger and the consumer dollars at 
both the record and concert levels have greatly increased," she said in the 
publication's January issue. 
</P>
<P>
She cited Mary-Chapin Carpenter, Joe Diffie, Randy Travis, Ricky Van Shelton, 
Clint Black, Patty Loveless and Garth Brooks as among those making an impact.
