NIST processing of the data as supplied by Lexis-Nexis included the following:

1. The data was split into multiple files, with each file representing
   the articles from one day.  Newlines were added after most tags,
   and document text was formatted such that lines broke at word boundaries
   at approximately 80 characters in length.

2. TREC DOCNO's were added, and the document number included in the Lexis-Nexis
   file was preserved as a "DOCID".  DOCNO's are of the form
        <filename>-<sequence number> (e.g., LA042990-0002)
   where filename is the name of the file in which the article is included
   and sequence number is a count of the number of articles from the beginning
   of that file.
   
3. To maintain consistency with other NIST/TREC collections, all tags were
   forced to upper case only and the "TEXT" tag replaced the "BODY" tag of
   the original file.  
 
4. Bracketing errors with the <TEXT> and </TEXT> tags  (i.e., unbalanced
   tags within a single document) were corrected.  The <TEXT> tag was added
   to follow the <HEADLINE> tag and the </TEXT> tag was added to precede the
   <GRAPHIC> </GRAPHIC> or <TYPE></TYPE> or </DOC> tags where appropriate.
